The environment was absolutely unhygienic, making it impossible to enjoy our stay. the dining area and kitchen were both open, allowing flies to roam around. The cooking area and the inside of the fridge were visibly dirty, which raised concerns about food safety. The room itself was barely satisfactory. The bathroom was no hot water available for shower. The most shocking aspect of our experience was the mishandling of the arranged itinerary and transportation, which occurred not once, but twice. Despite confirming the arrangements and payment in advance, we were left without any prior notification or contact details, neither the car nor the driver showed up, this resulted in an anxious and angry situation, as we had to waste precious time and additional fund to make alternative arrangements. On the day of our checkout, our local friend had already paid for one night's accommodation but the landlord claimed to have no record of the payment. Since our local friend was unable to contact at that time due to work commitments, we were left with no choice but to pay the full amount again. It was only after we managed to contact our local friend and speak to the landlord in person that she confirmed receiving the pre-payment and offered to refund our friend. This entire incident caused us unnecessary stress and further financial burden. The lack of professionalism, dishonesty and irresponsibility displayed by the landlord through out these incidents is simply unacceptable.","We loved the great location, the great view of mount Batur in the back and the view of the lake in the front. The setting is amazing with the two little huts and the great garden and warm water pool . It's camp style , so it's very basic. The family who runs it was very nice and provided a good service. If you like nature, great views this is the place.","We stayed 1 night. A very comfortable and quiet place, perfect for those of you who are looking for tranquility. Access way to the camp should be guided by the owner. There is a natural hot spring pool to play and chill around. recommended for those of you who like the back to nature concept","Loved our stay here, this place is beautiful, the hosts are so kind/helpful, and super close to Mount Batur.  One of the hosts guided us to the top of Mount Batur.  They provided dinner and breakfast, it was tasty.  The shower is cold, but refreshing and there's a warm hot spring bath for soaking.",the place was great! the food n veggies was so fresh!

It has private natural hot spring, the person who standby and assist us, provide everything (I think they are family of the owner) were so kind, helpful, the best of the best! Really really enjoying my stay there.
Minor thing is the lighting in bathroom I think need to replace to the brighter one. Thatâ€™s it.
For the Flies, I think that is happened in all Kintamani.
Do not forget to prepare your meals, drinks, before you go there. It is quite far to go back to restaurant/groceries. But you could ask the staff there to buy some food for you if he is available.",Ok,,,
