Such an unforgettable moments","Kubu Tepi Sawah is amazing.  From the time you walk into this cute little resort to the day you have to leave, you will be immersed in a time gone by. It is so relaxing looking out to the immaculate rice terraces. Watching the sunrise from your bed and spotting the fireflies at night. You will leave revitalised and thankful for the natural beauty that is still in this part of Bali. Thank you to KTS for your hospitality.  We will return.","Lovely place to spend your leisure time in Tabanan Bali
