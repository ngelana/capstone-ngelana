As previous reviews had said, the food took a while and there was a lack of meat in meals that were supposed have meat. We came here as part of a package. Nice view of the greenery.","- the ambience was quiet , calm n beautiful.
- the food was average  .v didn't like it as bit sweet n the rice wasn't fully cooked. But the soup was fine.
- tried seafood rice n chumi was soft n only had 2 prawns . Not same with other place .maybe for that price
- water they gave ice lemon tea.
- it's in package so we couldn't choose diff items.
- vegetable choice was better",Nice restaurant include in the trip to nusa penida,"üö®TOUTIST TRAP: The restaurant changed the name to Sagi, we were brought here by our tour guide driver. Menu is overpriced (double the price we paid on the restaurant in our hotel); the food took more than 30 minutes to be delivered, chicken fried rice and chicken noodles with NO CHICKEN (90.000rp each), super spicy, and the cherry on top of the cake: you pay 20% service for these atrocities.","I got the seafood fried noodles and it was pretty good. The fried noodle was piping hot and savoury. However, there is a lot of flies flying around while we were eating so it may not be so hygienic."

Not a typical tourist destination and therefore quite pleasant to sit there.  The food was good and reasonably priced (25-35k IDR).  Upon request, it was also sharper than normal.  You can't say anything about that.  However, the service was a little slow, which somehow contributed to the quiet.  But it shouldn't be like that :) However, the toilet is not recommended.

Recommended for a short stopover on the further round trip!",It seams that this place is an ordinary tourist trap. I ordered seafood noodles and it smelled  old fish and they use instant noodles for the dish. Also they charged double the regular price for the simple dishes.,They have wide variety of dishes though it's a small hotel in Nusa penida. But taste is in the average range. Price of the dishes are average just been the place to fill our tummy during travel.,Authentic Indonesian food for a fair price! Went twice for lunch we loved it! Deffo recommend if you‚Äôre wanting a pit stop for lunch on your scooter.,"This restaurant was included in our package for lunch, food was average. French fries was the only food that tasted really good. Staff here was polite."

Very very expensive for what they serve. If you come with a guide just ask to go in another restaurant !",Very good service and good food üôåü´∂,99% of the guests are only brought there because of their tour guide. Food is alright but in no relation to their prices. Staff is pretty  slow even thought they‚Äôre overstaffed.,Tourist trap avoid,"Triple the price while the food was average...
Was dropped off there by our tour guide.
Definitely not coming back"
