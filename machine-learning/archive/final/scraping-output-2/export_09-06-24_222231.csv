It is not the sort of luxury place that you find in 5 star hotel but hey the food is very nice, the service is attentative, they speak English well, nothing too much trouble and the dessert is to die for.

Will recommend it to anyone if they want to venture out off main street of Lovina.","What a lovely gem of a place. I had fabulous Eggs Benedict, cappuccino and ice lemon tea for a breakfast in a tranquil ambiance overlooking beautiful mountains.  I really enjoyed my morning here and got a cinnamon roll from the downstairs bakery to go. I‚Äôd definitely come back.","Hands down best eggs Benedict and smoothie bowls in Lovina!

The quality of food and ingredients here is probably the best out of all restaurants in Lovina. They do incredible desserts and decent coffee.
The pasta is exceptional, great pork burger also that has its own twist but ultimately, all food uses extremely clean and high quality ingredients.
The staff are also very lovely.

Definitely a must try in Lovina.
It is located a bit out of the way but adds for a cool vibe.","Lovely location, great food and chill atmosphere.Must do in Lovina. Coffe was amazing. We‚Äôll come back here for the rest of our holiday."

Now for the not so good part - the rooms. We checked in after 14:00. The room was very hot and with very heavy sweet smell. AC worked, but barely.

I have seen some reviews about ants infestation. They are right. There were a lot of small ones and many big black ones as well. Plus is that if you kill a spider or step on the big one, then the small ones will clear the mess in just a few minutes :D Ants didnt go on the bed, so that was ok.

One more unpleasant surprise in mornings - we were woken up by weird noises from above the ceiling. I am pretty sure there are rats in the attic.

The rooms had a huge bed, a small refrigerator and a hot shower with great water pressure. Everything is clean and organized for a wonderful price. Some may say that the bathrooms are outdated but everything functions properly, is clean, and times are tough with people trying to survive after covid. I would definitely recommend staying here. The owner said that prior to covid they had a restaurant where his family cooked but they're just trying to get back on their feet again right now. He said eventually they will get that opened up again. Thank you!","Great place with large swimming pool and spacious rooms. As a family we found it a bit far from the tourist centre, making it dificult to get to the beach woth 2 kids.

You have a very nice restaurant very close which would also deliver. Breakfast is prepared in the villa at a time of your choice and you eat on the great terrace. The kids also enjoyed feeding the fishes in the little pond every day. We always walked to the beach which takes 15-20 minutes but you can use a little shortcut if it is not dark yet. The beach is also nice and you can nicely relax while watching the sunset. When we stayed there a week ago, there were very few tourists but many restaurants and good infrastructure. We loved the stay! Thank you for everything!","Villa Kelapa in lovina is awesome! It's feels luxurious has a beautiful garden with a swimming pool. 3 spacious rooms. The master bedroom has a super deluxe bathroom with a bathtub . And there's a semi outside shower bathroom. Plus a smaller bathroom with toilet. All the bathrooms has a  toilet. And there's a good size kitchen with all the kitchenware if you want to cook yourselfs. It's a quite area, some few hundred meters from the road. You hear only locals passing by. Yeni the housekeeper is the best, she is very helpful and friendly and speaks very good English. The garden is well maintained by the Gardner. He comes every day. To clean and sweep. The one negative I have is about the airco. They make alot humming noise. They work great. But the noise coming from the outside units is very loud. You hear the resonance trough the walls. But that's the only negative I've got. If I come back to lovina. I make an effort to stay in Villa Kelapa.","When I stayed there the other villa was empty so we got the whole place by ourselves.

The pool really relaxing. The people also very nice. Owner also ok.

It's a very spacious apartment right at the back of the property which means privacy and quietness. It was clean to an extent but areas such as the windows and frames could do with a good deep clean. It's also very much in need of some maintenance and care (we had a leak in the bathroom ceiling, which they did attempt to repair during our stay).

Saying all of this, the Airbnb has just recently changed to new ownership (we met the new owner who is really lovely, and seems to be on a mission to get everything repaired and in order). So by the time someone else stays here, this will more than likely be resolved.

The apartment is furnished with a sofa, fridge/freezer, some random cupboards, a table and chairs and the kitchen is equipped with your basic needs (could do with a toaster and even a microwave), but it did the job for us.

The bed wasn't the most comfortable for a long stay, but it was manageable, and the bedroom has plenty cupboard space.

Yoga is the Airbnb manager, so if you need anything, he is very responsive and helpful, as he promptly communicates any issues/requirements to the owner/Wiwid.

Wiwid is one of the on-site staff (until 4pm daily). He's so very sweet and he manages anything you need, e.g. new towels, etc.

WiFi wasn't always very reliable/strong, but if you ask Wiwid or any of the on-site staff, they will restart it for you.

There is a pool onsite too, which is lovely! They have tanning beds, so you can enjoy some delicious sun and swimming in privacy.

There is a warung local nextdoor that sells basics like water, soft drinks, hair masks, and lots of random little extras - absolutely lovely owners - very friendly and welcoming indeed.

Whilst staying here, you should absolutely visit Me Jineng Restaurant, which is a 3min scooter ride away (turn left out of the gate). The restaurant, which has only been open for a month so far, is simple, yet beautiful. The service is second to none and the staff are warm, welcoming and friendly. The restaurant opens at 4pm. Their food is locally sourced, freshly made to order and absolutely scrumptious!

Lovina doesn't have much 'Grab' service - certainly not in the way of taxis, so you will need a bike if you stay here. We hired one from a local down the road, but I won't share the info as it was pretty battered, although thankfully got us around safely enough.

Apart from the few minor maintenance issues we experienced (and which were dealt with immediately), we thoroughly enjoyed staying here and would definitely recommend it!",Good place to stay if you have motorbike. Clean and spacious.,"hello, great place) can you please give me a contact number?",Perfect,
