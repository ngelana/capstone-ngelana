It is located into the tropical forest, having a beautiful infinity pool with a great view, and the rooms are big and clean.
The personnel is friendly, always smiling, and ready to  help with all our needs.","I had the most beautiful stay at 14 Palms. Right from arrival, the staff kept my bags aside as I had arrived early but had them in my room ready for me when I got back to check in. The room is huge, clean, has great air conditioning and I had a balcony with an incredible view. The pool is lovely and super refreshing on a hot day. It‚Äôs surrounded mainly by locals so you get a very authentic Bali experience but it‚Äôs close to some great restaurants and a 20-30 min scooter to the beaches. Every time you walk in or out the staff are so welcoming and friendly and ask if you need anything - they‚Äôre all wonderful and I have loved my stay here so much.","Very nice place in heart of Ungasan, very quiet. Service from staff was extraordinary. Very reccomended. Definitely will come again.","Rooms are huge but few amenities are missing for the tariff you pay here. Bathrobes, dressing mirror in room and bath tubs are not there. Air conditioner is of smaller capacity than the room size so the room takes a lot of time to cool. Room service can be improved. Breakfast is good but can have local balinese options as well. Location is a bit isolated so good for people who want a hideaway relaxing time. They provide scooters for additional rent. Staff is very friendly and gave us good recommendations to visit tourist places. Swimming pool and jacuzzi in the hotel is good",Very nice place to stay. Sheltered in a quiet area it's like a little oasis in itself. Big rooms with quality furnishings. A nice pool and a jacuzzi. Very friendly and helpful staff. Also good breakfast.

We were served a small appetizer and we ordered a churrasco de res sandwich, mixed veggies, and picanha with hand cut potatoes.  The picanha and potatoes were served with chimichurri and an aioli.  The picanha was so good and the chimichurri made it almost perfect.  I also appreciated the hand cut potatoes.

This is an outdoor restaurant with plenty of seating.  The staff were attentive and provided each table with mosquito spray as we were dining around dusk.  We will definitely return ‚Äî just writing this makes me want some more picanha!  Thanks for a great meal!","No comment about the food, they always give best best besttttt food!! Never fail

Really like the greens surrounding this area so we decided to stop by for coffee. Before we ordered they served free pretzels with a side of tomato jam (very unique and tasty!) And a bottle of water. Very thoughtful!
The smoothie bowl was served in a really pretty bowl üòçüòç and the coffee was nice too. The prices are reasonably cheap. All nice!

It was a great find!","Came here for breakfast. Didn‚Äôt stay in the hotel.
We had the French breakfast, Indonesian breakfast, papaya juice and coffee.
Both breakfasts were delicious! The coffee and juice were fresh.
Would definitely recommend!","This place is great for breakfast!!
Outdoor vibes and a modern interior, catchy!
It is also a good place to hang out to meet your friends just enjoy your brunch or maybe just grab some coffee

I ordered Egg benedict and American Breakfast & Coffee
ALL DELICIOUSü´∂üèª","A year and a half ago I stopped to live nearby, and one of the first days I went here and this place was closed, only to reopen a short time later.

Although the location and the cafe icon on the maps and reviews remained related to the old place even apparently before covidnye times.
Also here is a hotel, together with the cafe opened a spa.
I was in the spa and liked everything, but I propose to divide it into three different icons on the maps: hotel, restaurant, and spa.
So even though I liked the spa I will not consider it to evaluate the cafe.

The menu is new, nice, the breakfasts are interesting to try, the price is pleasantly cheap.
Coffee cappuccino was brought to me in a glass, and not very tasty. Most likely from an automatic nespresso machine or something like that. the taste is bitter and too milky.
As a compliment before the meal they gave me a small pretzel with tomato jam, not bad, plus for you.
They give you a bottle of water.

The place itself is quiet and tidy, you can't hear cars behind the glass. There is no interior, just tables and chairs, so only for eating, if you stop by.

American breakfast in general is okay, but not really tasty.

Location is strange, and there is never a waiter in the hall. He doesn't have a counter or a cash register. If you want something, you'll probably have to go find him yourself.

I think that the old 130 reviews and 4.3 rating from the old place will attract some new tourists, because those who live here know that the place is not working.
But since there's nothing unusual here, it won't spread between people, and it will fade away.
But the spa is nice, quiet, cozy. The mattresses could use a change, they're hard. And some foot massage chairs. They're not even there.

That's about it.
The review is rather for a nice man with whom we talked a couple of days ago, and he is apparently the manager/manager/owner.

P.s. now I'm trying to put a rating on the cards, and it offers me to rate not the food and restaurant, but the hotel and offers rooms and service. Well this is not very good. I will put 1 everywhere, correct it.
As I notice that you will correct I will change the stars to real 2-3 .","Amazing staff, amazing and new installations , amazing breakfast, best I found in uluwatu for price/quality"

Had a short stay here to catch a flight the next day. It was well worth the money.","Very old and non maintained place.  There are cockroaches in the room, mold everywhere and sewage smell. Shower hose is so short that you have to squat down to take a shower. If you want to enjoy your holiday, just avoid this place.","Horrible place. Very dirty and old  room with awful sewage smell that hotel tries to hide with different air freshener which makes it more unbearable.

The quality of fish (Tuna and Salmon) is definitely fresh like you see in Sushi or Sashimi in Japanese restaurants.
The sauce for poke was different from what we ordered, but I did not mind. Because the server looks like a trainee...
Their table (cafe size table) is bit small to eat for 2 people, but server told us that we can use 2 tables if we want to. So we did not worried about the space.
Mahalo!!","Hi üòÑThe place is very clean and new. I had a chocolate smoothie for breakfast, I also asked for fruit and they gave it to me... it was incredible and tuna spread. The bread was fresh and the portion was large.Both the spread and the smoothie were at a good price. I don't like going to local warungs, I rather look for restaurants similar to those in Europe and that's exactly how I felt.

The place is not very large but is enough to accommodate around 20 people in the room and there are tables outside too (We smoked outside the room while waiting for our orders to be ready, but we didn't see any ashtrays).  A very comfortable place with AC that functions well after activities outside Bali which is quite hot. Very friendly and smiling staff, who of course recommend the food.There is a children's play area in the corner of the room which indicates that this place is kids friendly which is good. And of course very tasty food. I asked for extra mayonnaise because it was very tasty, not too sour for my taste. There are cheap breakfast options for those of you who want to enjoy coffee and pastry in the morningüëçüèº.There are many similar cafes around the area, but we chose to stop at this place. Thank youü´Çüòá",I had mix tacos and mix poke bowl. Both were really delicious and fresh. I can say that one of the best poke bowls in Bali. For sure I will come back ü§§,"We were at breakfast.
The cafe is new, there are no people at all yet.
Beautiful and pleasant, modern interior.
Very attentive and trained staff - thank you.
We took toast with salmon, latte coffee and cocoa.
There is a children's corner with toys, ideal for clients with children.
I am sure that you need to do promotions for new visitors if you want to get a flow of customers.
Make something as a gift or a bonus so that new guests want to come to you.

üëÜI offered the manager to give us a bonus or discount for my new review, which would be a good advertisement for them. she took our photo for Instagram cafe, but did not respond to this offer. I think that for excellent reviews you need to make a bonus to the client - this is an advertisement for your cafe!
A toast to 80k is not cheap for this area, and no one here knows you yet.
We need to lure the client! üòé
Good luck!"
