Service is super duper nice, helpful and attentive.
Atmosphere is nice, plenty of seatings for group and personal. A lot of books for a coffee break while Work from Cafe.
Payment available in cash and cashless.","New favourite spot in Denpasar.

Food and drinks were nice. Please add more finger food variety. Pastry maybe?

I love the breezy atmosphere though I wish there was a designated smoking room rather than let them smoke in the garden. It's such a waste of fresh air.

Overall I like it here and will definitely coming back to work or read.","If you've read The Island of the Missing Trees, you'll know how fitting this place to the tavern in the book (only it's not selling any alcohol). ü•∫üçÉ

Seems like I found new places every other week, lol. Cozy for work and reading alone. Too bad they're only open until 8pm.

What I ordered:

Coffee: 30k (ok)
Pisang goreng gula bali: 25k (tasted amazing)","Totally in love with this place. The service is great, the staffs are so friendly and helpful. The price is reasonable. The food is also great. Nasi Ayam Suksma is recommended though it's a bit spicy for someone who doesn't enjoy spicy food like me, and Chicken Karaage&Fries they're so crunchy and tasty! They have high-speed WiFi. I conducted a speed test and it was around 50 Mbps! Quiet and comfortable environment and a very nice place for anyone who's looking for a workplace outside of their house. There's an indoor area with AC which is perfect.  I definitely will come back anytime I get bored working from home.","It wouldn‚Äôt be nice for me to gatekeep this place but I don‚Äôt want it to get too crowded because it‚Äôs just so nice that you finally find a coffee shop where you can be quite with yourself (it‚Äôs SO HARD for me to find one here in Bali) great coffee, good food (not exquisite but super okay, I just wish they have more variety). I just LOOOOVE the place because it‚Äôs so airy breezy with joglo & garden. I really like the mini library spot upstair, so nice for you to hide from the crowd. All the staffs are really nice too. If I can improve one thing, it would be the closet in the toilet because it looks dirty. But the rest are perfect, will definitely recommend this to my closed ones because I trust them not to make this lovely place noisy hehe"
