Fact is it is located in dense forest, no fencing installed in all side of property, it is open from forest side, which makes is unsafe. Moreover there is no gate latches and gates are always open.
Although staff is polite, food taste is good, but there is no one available in case of emergency in night time and In night there is a constant sound from wild insects and reptiles. There are a lot of lizards. Although the staff says that lizards are harmless, but they are scary.
Lizards roams on garden ground, pool wall, I don't know thy bite or not, but definitly it is scary.
I won't suggest it for honeymoon couple, specially if you have fear of insects and reptiles.","Amazing place. Away from the city. Completely in the jungle.
The food was really good
The place was awesome
Little bit of cleaning with bed sheets and curtains must be maintained","Iâ€™d highly recommend them to clean bed sheet thoroughly! considering the price of room and distance from the city, they can pay attention to hygiene more. Other than that, view is nice and bathtub was so comfy.","Ah wow.. I celebrated my birthday at Kumbuh Jungle and it was so wonderful. Thank you to the whole team for making this day so special. The food was so delicious and thank you for the wonderful cake! They also prepared a romantic dinner, floating breakfast and candle lights around the Bamboo House. It was the perfect place to end our bali trip. Saskia & Mauri","Beautiful place. Nice place too spend a quality time with your friends. And the service from Mas Ketut our Butler, is very excellent!"
