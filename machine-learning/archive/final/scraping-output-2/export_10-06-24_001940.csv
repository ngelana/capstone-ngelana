A quiet place away from the noise, lovely staff and definitely clean. The pool is completely private and everything is perfect.","Very very nice staff there. Very close to the rice fields from Tegalalang and about 7km to Ubud, but they offer you free transport to Ubud during the day(modern cars). They can you also rent a scooter for just about 5E per day.

A very good breakfast but unfortunately you don‚Äôt have many options for it...

The villa is located in the middle of some rice fields so it is very quiet there.

You have a private pool there, and everything is very clean.","What a waste and space villas are there!!!
It's was a last 2 days in Bali and that was such beautiful time for us.
Private pool villa's are there and they are amazing. They make privacy properly for us and such a amazing place.
Quality of pool is amazing there extra features makes massage.
Food is ok.
Otherwise helping people, quick room service and transportation facilities is awesome.luv it","Awesome place very good service, very good location. The rooms specious and are having attached pool for every room. Rooms lack some furniture but it really doesn't matter. Slightly far from Ubud village though. The food is tastey and service is good. It is situated between rice terraces so no need to specially visit another rice terrace..Overall awesome experience..",Very good place to stay . Everything was awesome . All staff are very supportive.  One request as most of the guest are Indian s so please increase the Veg meals. Also inform the staff to clearly mention / inform the guest of veg & non veg meals. We have asked for onion soup and staff served us Onion Bacon (Pork) soup. And after consuming it they informed it is mixed with Bacon and they forget veg soup .

We have enjoyed your stay there.","A Hidden Gem Touched Our Hearts!

Our stay at this homestay was an absolute treasure trove of beautiful moments! Everything about this place, from its idyllic location to the cozy rooms and the incredible people, left an indelible mark on our hearts. Initially, we had planned for just a two-night stay, but we were so enchanted by the experience that we couldn't resist extending it for another night.

The allure of the location, just a quick 5-minute motorbike ride away from a breathtaking waterfall, was what initially drew us in. Little did we know that what we'd fall in love with even more was the enchanting village life that surrounded us. Wandering through the neighborhood on foot, we discovered countless treasures.

What truly sets this homestay apart is the sincere love and profound philosophy that this remarkable family lives by. From the wise and welcoming father to the warm-hearted mother, and even their kind daughter, son, and sweet granddaughter, everyone exudes an authentic sense of serenity and kindness. Our hearts felt privileged to have shared moments with them.

Don't miss out on the opportunity to stay here. It's more than just a place to rest your head; it's an authentic, heartfelt experience that will leave a lasting impression. This hidden gem touched our souls and made our journey truly unforgettable.","‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Stayed at Wayan‚Äôs homestay and it was an experience I‚Äôll cherish forever. The family is wonderful and made us feel right at home. Not only was the place comforting and welcoming, but having Wayan as a tour guide made the trip even more special. Truly one of the best guides I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of meeting‚Äîhis kindness and knowledge made our adventure unforgettable. We hope we can come back in the future. Highly recommend!"
