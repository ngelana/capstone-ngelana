Even though the parking lot was large when I went there it was quite full, there were quite a lot of people queuing, luckily most of them were take away. The dining area is also spacious, the table and chair arrangements are suit small groups. even though it's crowded, the service is relatively fast and there's live music too, so it doesn't feel boring while waiting. The most important thing I thought, since plastic bags are not allowed and bag not provided there, so buyers must provide their own bags to carry their food. Since I take it away, when I eat it the noodle taste quite dry.","This place selling noodle and specially hot noodle. I come to this place with my wife and there are some choice about where we can sit. Located near the paddy field, we can anjoying food by watching some green paddy. Unfortunatelly the crowded are very high and the waiters are limited and they overhelmed by the order and cleaning the table. When I want to sit near the paddy, the table are very dirty and the waiters are too busy with the order. If you see enough, the floor are very dirty and they cant clean all the segment. Lets move to the food, The food are good. But need a quite long time to arrived in out table.

The dimsum are late and come when we finished eat our noodle and drink","Self proclaimed hottest noodles‚Ä¶ No.
I had level 4 and it was meh‚Ä¶ a place more for youngsters to hang out. It was basically instant noodles with seasoning and some fried dumplings. I was rather disappointed. Not real food. Good for snacking only.","New noodle restaurant in Singaraga.
Well done management!

Huge parking area out the front.

Menu is noodles with some starter options and a drink option. When you enter a staff member explains the menu and helps you sigh your choice.
There is inside, and outside seating options.
Outside there is a pleasant rice field view .
There's a children's play area.

Service was prompt and the staff are pleasant and helpful.

Meals were well presented and tasty.
The spicy option is quite hot...so keep that in mind if you don't want too much chilli.

Prices are local and very reasonable.
Would I come back again?

Most Definitely!!","Avoid lunch and dinner time, especially on weekends. The queue line is amazeballs.

The noodle level is based on how much chili you asked. Try their es pocong, it‚Äôs so refreshing"
