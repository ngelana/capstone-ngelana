The facilities were clean and tidy.

The staff were lovely and hospitable.
They made a beautiful present on the bed saying ""Happy birthday"" for our birthday that day.
There was even a security guard at night keeping us safe.

Location is on one side great thanks to the beautiful rice field views, but too far away (20 minutes) from the Canggu area where everything happens.
If you have breakfast with Gr√ºn but stay at the villa with private pool than you've got a 2-3 minute drive to the hotels main location a bit south of where you'd stay. Keep in mind when taking breakfast with that room.","We came here straight off the airport for 3 nights and had a near perfect experience. Clean, beautiful design, helpful staff. Amazing lush garden, with a shared pool that almost seemed like a private pool. Perfect breakfast spot next door. Easy to reach Canggu by motorbike. Top notch stay!","We arrived right after our flight to Bali and were very happy to have found this really nice place. It's quiet, green, and beautiful view from the studio. In the morning you wake from the sunrise over rice fields. Staff is helpful and kind.","Had a great 1-night stay at Grun! It has a modern tropical design with 2 pools. The room is cozy and clean, but i spotted 2 caterpillars on the floor, which is no big deal.","Beautifully designed treehouses with a lovely view over rice fields. The staff were amazing - so attentive and lovely.
The place feels quiet and peaceful as it‚Äôs set back from the busy centre of canggu. It is a slightly longer scooter ride from the main area but worth it."

Over all nice experience.","Stayed only one night after a long flight. The man at reception was very welcoming and saw us to our rooms. The room itself is a decent size, however it could do with a deep clean and more / better lighting. Overall, considering the price, it‚Äôs still a good deal, but it would not be difficult to improve the guest experience. There is a great restaurant up the road too that serves delicious food from breakfast to dinner. Turn left out of the property and you‚Äôll find it on the bend on the right-hand side.

We have kept coming back, at least once a month, is our destination for an incredible burger. We try others often, however 2080's metaverse simple rules. Our kids are now joining us (not sure if that is a good thing or not yet) and also loved it. Well done 2080.

Really simple venue, extremely simple, however their burgers do rock. The Metaverse, think a smokey cheeseburger with a chuck of tender smoked brisket on top. Every chew was thoroughly enjoyed. Had the cheesy bacon fries this time (had truffled fries last time), also wonderful (and would suggest these, not the truffle fries).
Add a KuruKuru (or 2) and was a great catchup with a decadent burger (and fries)
And forgot to take a photo, so grabbed some from their Instagram...","I order burger nano nano with small fries, the taste of the beef patty so juicy, with crispy fries i like it. the best burger i have ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê","Strong burger game! Loved the brisket, fast service.

I'm now going to be a regular 100%, strong smokey bbq taste, dripping sauce and goodness all over your fingers, sauce and mayonnaise around your mouth when you take each bite, it's a classic true burger experience, absolutely love it.

- Friendly staff, enjoyable to chat and joke with.
- Beautiful grounds and pleasant music.

Cons:
- Terrible management. Fix prices then increase them, claiming it's just business. Unhappy? Move out. They can tell you to leave tomorrow for a new tenant.
- Disrespectful attitude, focus on maximizing profit from tourists. Room prices not worth it.
- Some staff are rude when faced with legitimate complaints. Expect accusations and humiliation for requests.
- Random pricing: Costs for identical rooms vary monthly.
- Potential triple price hike with a ""take it or leave it"" attitude. Room rates jumped from 4 to 10 million in months.
- Frequent electricity cuts, sometimes for an hour. Unstable internet.
- Crumbling, damp walls hidden behind beds or furniture.
- Months of nightly disturbance by rats until fixed.
- Unrepaired bathroom tap, remains loose and leaky.
- Slippery staircase tiles; several falls experienced. Risk of serious injury.
- Sometimes loud music at night, disturbing sleep.
- Mold in rooms, simply painted over rather than cleaned. Health hazard.
- Noisy due to nearby brick factory.
- Presence of large spiders and cockroaches.
- Clean pillows placed on the floor during bed-making.
- Limited hot water, dependent on usage by others.

Conclusion:
- Not recommended. Now plenty of new, clean, pleasant places where you're treated well for reasonable prices and with certainty for the future.","We spent an amazing month at the lodge! Clean rooms, responsive and friendly staff and its place is very strategic! Will surely come back.","First of all I'd like to mention that the staff is great. They're very friendly and accommodating.

However, the management can not be trusted to keep their agreement.

I booked a room for December, arranged the deposit together with the staff and signed some contracts containing the remaining balance that was left to be paid. To my dismay, this contract was broken a few weeks before arrival stating that they were going to raise the price of the room for me because ""they have to move forward once the Covid times are over"". Of course, I am not denying that the Covid times have been difficult to say the least. However, this is no justification to break an already existing contract.

Despite the positive communication I had with the staff, they put their profit over the significance of a signed contract and friendly relations, which is why I cannot recommend this place to anyone.","The complete staff is awesome, so friendly and helpfull all the time. We highly recommend to stay here if you like peace and quiteness, because it's outside of the centre of Canggu.",Nice place to stay. Great service. Very kind staff. The location is far from crowded roads but also you need some time to get to the nearest supermarket or fruit bazaar. The closest stores are very small.

You probably will find something of the same price with a better location. But that is the only thing I could possibly criticize - super friendly staff, the room was cleaned regularly, a fridge in the room, we used the kitchen a lot, the appliances were sufficient, free drinking water, soap and shampoo. Just outside the property there is a nice view over some rice terraces. I am happy that we stayed there! :)","The first day we arrived we thought we were in paradise, nothing could be further from the truth. We found out that there was construction work all around us, we were literally drilled out of bed. And that was not the only thing, the cockroaches running around (probably due to the filthy construction work) were also very dirty. I do not recommend anyone to ever book here, for the same price you have much better accommodations at better locations!","New place but dishonest owner.

I had a few friends staying here in 3 rooms different rooms and since I was in rush of finding my new long term place I took the room but the owner charged the new peak season price, 4.5 mil a month. My friend and I are long term guests.

I understand the price during high season will be higher but I did not understand why I was the only one paying the new price for July. All the other guests, including my friends, were charged much less. Some even almost half of what I paid.

I chatted with their customer service person to complain about being the only one paying differently during high season month and nothing happened, they just ignored me.

The day before I moved in a construction started just next to the guest house and of course I was not notified and I found out too late after I paid all the month already. It is common practise to let guest know about the possible noises and even reduce the price for the inconvenience. I just feel they tried to be smart.

There has been noises from early morning to sunset, 7 days a week, and still the construction is not completed.

If someone is in the shared area speaking at night, it looks like the person will be in your room. Walls are so thin here.

The guest house is new but the room is super small, no tv, no proper wardrobe and the cleaning is not everyday.

There are other places in better location which have same price and offer everyday cleaning, tv and bigger rooms.

Now the rooms are advertised for 5.5 mil, be sure that if you book it you will be the only one paying the new higher price.

If you want to feel stupid and used, stay here, otherwise support other local and more honest people.

If you find space in this guesthouse while all the other ones are full, there must be a reason.",Owner is only money-hungry and will turn around on her word on the first chance she make to make money. Avoid at all costs.,"The rooms are modern and clean. The staff is very friendly and always there when you need them.
Only downside is that the pool doesn't catch a lot of sun and is therefore too cold to actually swim inside"

Food: Selem Gadang Healthy Food undoubtedly exceeded all expectations. The chicken wrap was a revelation, setting a new standard for wraps with its flavorsome and perfectly balanced ingredients. Meanwhile, the salad my partner ordered was a hit, a testament to the freshness and quality of the produce.

Service: The Balinese hospitality truly shone through at Selem Gadang. From the moment we stepped inside, the warm smiles and genuine enthusiasm from the staff made us feel like cherished guests. Their attentiveness and friendly demeanor elevated the dining experience to a whole new level.

Atmosphere: If I could, I'd give the atmosphere a 10/5 rating without hesitation. Selem Gadang's garden-centric setup is a stroke of genius. The charming tables nestled amidst lush greenery lend an enchanting touch to the dining experience. Knowing that the veggies are sourced from this very garden adds a delightful and genuine touch to the entire affair.

Bonus: The cherry on top was the affordability. Selem Gadang's prices are refreshingly reasonable, especially when compared to other establishments of similar caliber. This thoughtful pricing only solidifies its status as a go-to destination for those seeking not only healthful fare but also exceptional value.

Selem Gadang Healthy Food is a true standout, weaving together delectable cuisine, genuine service, and an enchanting atmosphere. It's a gem that deserves to be celebrated and frequented by all who appreciate a holistic dining experience.","This natural nuanced cafe is very clean and comfortable to eat while chatting with friends or alone.
