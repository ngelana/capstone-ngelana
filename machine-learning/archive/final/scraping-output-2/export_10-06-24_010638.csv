The Thai milk tea was good and fits my taste. What is awesome is the parking space as it is very spacey and the cafe itself is very comfy to spend the afternoon at.,"Good space for working remotely, they made great filter coffee. Also their matcha latte is delish ü´∞","The food - could be better, a bit too plain to my preference. Howwever the coffee was good.
The service - is good, the people are friendly.
Atmosphere - a good ambiance, quiet surroundinga and a good confy designfor working, but when i was there, the ac seems to be broken so its pretty much veryy hot.","This place is Located inside the TAT. The cafe itself is quite small, most of the people here are probably guests from TAT or will go to TAT. The parking space was very huge. The service was good and humble, but they forgot to give me a receipt (but doesn't matter tbh). The coffee and the internet were so-so. when I arrived at the table near the window to the toilet, they didn't turn the light on so a bit dark actually.
The ambience was pretty good tho, though people mostly did their own work so pretty calm and quiet place",Had dinner and a coffee here - highly recommended. Staff are super friendly too

I contacted the owner about late check in, around 11-12 pm, and they are very accommodating. Other than that, I don't think I will ever stay there again. I asked the owner if towel and soap are provided, and he said yes. But there was none upon arrival.

After reading their reviews, I almost cancel the booking, but in the end, I went and brought my own towel and soap, even bedsheet and blanket. There was no tissue provided either.

There was a sink, but no water. So I needed to use the shower every time I want to wash my hands. And the sink drainage actually going into the bathroom... So if the sink had tap water, the dirty water from the sink would flow into the bathroom floor.

There was a TV, but I didn't try to turn it on. AC was working, not very cold, but enough that I could sleep without feeling hot.","I showed up at ""Napura Homestay"" on Sunday 27th of November as per my booking confirmation.

No one was at the check-in desk and after waiting several minutes someone showed up just to tell me that there are NO rooms available.

I have booked my stay over a month in advance and they haven't had the decency to notify me that there are issues with their rooms or any change. There were no calls, no emails, or any notice on bookingdotcom or from Napura Homestay.

I essentially wasted money on transportation to get there only to be told there are no rooms. The person that showed up was incredibly rude and dismissive.

I had to leave and literally start hunting for a different places to stay which meant spending more on taxi fees which that was totally unnecessary had I got any notice.

This is no way to behave or conduct a business in hospitality. Very unprofessional. I'm extremely disappointed.","Worst room in Denpasar. I have to wait 30 minutes to arrive for check in. Bed linens not changed - dirty, hairs in bed... Bed cover without linen. No towel, soap etc. Bathroom also bag maintenance and dirty - cigarette butts. I booked the Deluxe room on Agoda and I got the Standard room only.","The room conditions really bad
The bed sheet is worse
The balcony door can't be locked","Looks nice on pictures but it might be taken long ago. Needs to improve the management and maintainance, especially the bathroom."

Luckily, we found this Es Pisang Ijo shop called Same Same just around the corner. We decided to give it a try after reading the reviews in Google Maps. It is a small and pack shop. It has a shared parking lot for scooters with the other stores but I don‚Äôt think the parking lot able to hold more than 2 cars.

I talked to the seller and it was originally for take away only, so they don‚Äôt have enough space to eat there. Probably just 2-3 tables.

About the taste, it is soooo good! I love how smooth the ice and how soft the bananas are. The price is also quite cheap with a big portion of Es Pisang Ijo.

My wife and I are very satisfied customer and would love to get back here again soon!",All menu is good,Very delicious!,Endddulita,
