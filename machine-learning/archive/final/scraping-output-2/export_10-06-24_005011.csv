Clean. Peaceful. Only a sprinkle of other tourists even on a Sunday. When I was in the pond under the waterfall I was the only one there and it was magical and breathtaking to feel the roar of the water and the power of nature. Short walk. Easy access. 20k entry. A few shops at entrance if you need water or supplies or a bite to eat.,"A beautiful short walk down to the waterfall. Quite a few uneven steep steps up and down so be careful. Entry fee is 20k pp but so worth it. Parking is free. The ferocious flow of the water is breathtaking. I recommend definitely going in for a dip, the water was crisp and refreshing. The rocks climbing over to the other side can be quite slippery so watch your step. We went early afternoon and it was quiet enough, so lots of opportunities for great photographs. There are restaurants at the top next to the parking with cheap tasty food and beverages. A lovely experience.","this waterfall is not so much famous and crowded in that area but it is really beautiful and worth to visit. The way was not so hard and there were many stairs but less risky. When you arrive down at the end of the stairs, the waterfall is so close and you can easily get inside the river and also reach the waterfall. There are many statues beside the river and under the water fall which are made by local people and they are so interesting. There is a nice cafe which has also a shower beginning the ways. Also there is a very good restaurant that you can have food after you come back. The food is amazingly delicious and high quality.","Very nice waterfall and, above all, devoid of crowds of tourists.
The descent is a little steep, but safe, the approach to the waterfall itself requires crossing a rushing river, but quite shallow (about 1m).
Locals charge 0.5Eur to cross (not sure why). There is a small local restaurant near the entrance, and a very nice pizzeria on the main road.","Suspicious individuals came out of their homes asking for money to walk down the stairs. No ticket was issued and unsure if they are sharing the spoils with the community.

Waterfall was okay nothing spectacular. Would recommend exploring other waterfalls or ridges. 15-30mins there and you get bored

Do be careful at the waterfall as the rocks above water gets really slippery even with anti slip water sandals."

There is a waterfall very close by and the warung at the hotel is very nice!,"This place is exceptional.

I organised through a mutual friend to stay to get a local tattoo. (Stenink tattoo is just 5 mins down the road.)

The staff are super friendly and helpful. The restaurant makes great food and has superb views of rice fields right out front.

The room I stayed in was super chic. TV, queen bed, with cable tv and Netflix (bring your own account), then separate lounge room and separate partially roof  covered shower (hot and cold water) and toilet. I thought that was the winning touch, really. It's pretty cool having a shower overlooking nature.

This is exactly the place I was looking for, without even knowing it, quiet and modern,with attentive staff and a super relaxing vibe.

There's an sexy waterfall about 400 meters down the way through a forest with stone carvings and not too many visitors.

I will absolutely come back here for a chill few nights. I only hope I can get the same room.

Thankyou guys for your hospitality and excellent vibe.

Winner!!!!!!

Peace ‚úåÔ∏è","Great place to chill, with a small restaurant and various dishes to try out. There is also shared kitchen and a fresh water top up. Quiet and far from busy roads of Ubud. More of a village sounds of dogs and roosters and wheezing pigeons.
Rooms spacious and nicely decorated, cleaned every day, but cleaning needs improvement as we had a loads of spider webs around, and they werent freshly built. Not soundproofed as we could hear everything neighbors were talking about. There are no night silence rules like in other places we have stayed. Towels fresh and not smelly. Interesting shower but not to be worry, there is a hot water.
Definitely need to rent a scooter to get around, waiting time for a taxi is sometimes ridiculous and they often cancel the ride","Beautiful peaceful atmosphere , best place to stay in all Bali to have chill üèù great opportunity to listen forest beautiful sounds away from aggressive tourism of other cities , here the time slow down !!
Just next to amazing waterfall , staff is probably the most welcome local people we ever met into the all island there very nice people to have a talk and the owner speak good English so easy for foreigner travellers  . If you are lucky you can meet imade patra the artist of waterfall sculpture is very fascinating man , ask about the story of the waterfalls ü•≤ you will be impressed.

The property is neat and beautiful with a lovely swimming pool. The owners were very welcoming and pleasant. The room and toilet were spacious when compared to other places we stayed in Bali. The only issue we had is that the menu had very limited options, particularly vegetarian. But they were kind enough to prepare food for us without using oyster sauce, which we are allergic to. They even provided bread and eggs for early breakfast to us on request on the day we had to leave early in time for the ferry. The property is a bit difficult to access , but it is compensated by the peaceful environment that we get to experience. Truly enjoyed our stay here. A wonderful place to experience the beauty of Ubud.","Yoga and Merry were extremely welcoming, friendly and warm people. They made us feel fully comfortable and happy during our stay. On top of this incredible hospitality, it was the best place we stayed during our time in Bali. The room and bathroom were absolutely beautiful, spacious and spotlessly clean. The breakfast was beautifully served. The garden area was stunning with so many trees and plants that Yoga himself had created by hand. It was located away from the busy city centre where we could enjoy peace and quiet. We could not speak highly enough of this place and we would love to stay here again. Thank you!","Merry and Yoga are wonderful hosts! We were very well taken care of as guests and their accommodation was clean, comfortable and quiet.

Waterfalls were within walking distance and whilst it was further away from the Ubud center bustle, it was exactly what we wanted as we were looking for a nice quiet space with nature nearby! üå≥","Merry's accommodation is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a cozy and comfortable place to stay. The rooms are clean and well-maintained, with all the necessary amenities to make your stay enjoyable. The location is convenient, with easy access to nearby attractions and restaurants.

Great room, felt more like a house, outside shower in the bathroom, great rice paddy view, swimming pool, amazing breakfast and wayan and her son are very helpful and kind. Good price as well!! A little outside the busy ubud centre, and I loved that! Great tour to take the motorbike, lovely views! Will definitely come back!","Super stay was here for 10 days. It was the first stay on Bali, so I was lucky to find this guesthouse. A very cozy patio with pool, 3 villas and the hospitality of owners make you feel like home.

Owner orgamized a transfer from airport for decent price - taxi price and was helpful with advices of what sightseeings we should check out and organazing a volcano trekking. Besides, I payed for my stay on the next day after I changed money in a good money changer.

A huge advantage of this villa is that the place is very quiet and beautiful with the plenty of palm trees and rice fields around and at the same time it is very close to main noizy streets of Ubud from where it is also fast to reach nice waterfalls and other sighta on the north-nort-east.

There are a couple of good cafes closeby-3-5 mins by bike or even 2 mins walking to local price warung.
Rooms were cleaned all the time once we are out, towels were changed every day. Lovely breakfast is either an omlet with great balineese coffee/tea or banana pancake with chocolate with fruits.

Don't think, just rent it. You won't regret","You shouldn't hesitate to go there, not only the location is great (in the middle of the rice terrasse), but the couple owning and managing the guesthouse are the nicest indonesian we ever met. The rooms are really clean (the house is new and has been ran for 9 months, so fresh building), the breakfast delicious (best omelette :) ), and they propose scooters to rent, and tours if you want. Anyway, one of the best place we stayed at in Indonesia.","Uma Budhas Guesthouse was a great value. Our room was large and sunny with a comfortable bed, a shower under the stars and doors that open directly  onto the pool. The downside of this was that it was super sunny right at dawn. Nevertheless, I still managed to sleep through breakfast on the first day which was kind of a bummer because the breakfast was delicious. Later that day, while lounging in the pool with a beer, I mentioned to the owner that I missed breakfast and he gave me some ""kue"" that was leftover. (Mini pandan crepes filled with palm sugar and coconut, yum! ) The next day I woke up in time for stir fried noodles and a plate of mixed tropical fruit. Also yum.

Uma Budhas is a 15 minute scooter ride away from central Ubud, in a super friendly village. I had rented a bike, which unfortunately was broken (lesson = always check bike gears on multi-speed bikes when renting) and a couple of locals didn't hesitate to try and help me fix it.

Although there is no restaurant or cafe at Uma Budhas, you can order delivery from Caf√© Balifornia. I recommend the ayam goreng (Indonesian fried chicken), it was super tasty."

We highly recommend this restaurant as the prices are on top of everything very reasonable.","I just ordered a Pizza with some Pasta and had delivered via Gojek. The Pizza was good but the Mushroom Pasta tasted and smelled foul and rotten, almost as if someone threw up into the Pasta. It was the worst Pasta I ever had and I hope i do not get food poisoning from that. I would recommend customers to be aware of this and stay alert when being served food (especially if delivered home).","We have been here twice already and will likely go back for more! Nyoman (server) is so friendly and speaks great English. We had a great conversation with him as well as the owner Wayan.

They use only the best ingredients and many ingredients are local. The dough on the pizza was very crispy on the bottom and is likely best for dine in VS take out as the pizza may not be as good if sitting in a box for awhile.

They serve delicious ice coffee and smoothies! We also had a Todesco sunrise.

We want to go back and try the pasta and have another pizza! Highly recommend üçïüôè","Great restaurant in a quiet area. the family & staff are so kind and the food is great. the spaghetti pomodoro was incredibly delicious.

The first 'waterfall' you see was a trickle of water falling from what looked to be a man-made cut out in the cliff. I actually had to question if that was actually the waterfall? The stairs down are very steep , the railing is a bit ropey but safe enough to get down. There are some nice photo oppurtunies at the start of the path to the waterfall with very colourful flowers , palm trees and some rice fields. The price was 20k per person which is the same as the most touristy waterfall Tegenungan. Later after climbing back to the top the local person working there asked how it was ? We said quite bad due to how poor the waterfall was , he then said there was a bigger one further up if you walk through the river. Why he didn't tell us this when paying i'm not sure ? At this point we couldn't be bothered for the long walk back down to try find the supposedly 'bigger waterfall' . We paid 15k for an unreal waterfall known as Uma Anyar before this one, which is 5 mins down the road , the staff there were very helpful and you get a guide free of charge (unless you feel generous enough to tip which we did).
