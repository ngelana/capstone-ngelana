Helped us book dolphin sunrise tour, which was an amazing experience and helped us arrange a taxi to Gilimanuk pier.

Staff were also okay with us ordering a parcel to the hotel and helpful with communicating its arrival so we could collect it.

If you‚Äôre looking for a good lunch / dinner spot - Lovina life cafe is next door with great food choices both Asian and Western.","I stayed at Lovina Beach Hotel with my family and friends for a week. I'm this time, we ate a fair bit at the restaurant on the hotel grounds.

The food was repeatedly excellent without fail, across breakfast, lunch and dinner regardless of which staff was on shift.

We found staff both within the restaurant and also generally within the hotel to provide excellent customer service and it is clear to me that going above and beyond for clients is a core value for the hotel and we were collectively very impressed.

The location was also brilliant right next to the beach and close to all the other food venues, and we were offered on site parking for our hire vehicle.

The hotel is not 5 class, but staff clean daily and do a brilliant job.

I would both recommend this hotel, and return myself.","The hotel is outdated so badly.
Surprisingly, there was no hot water in our room.
No fridge,  no kettle.
The location is perfect, though, and the staff is super friendly and attentive.
Breakfast was good.
The pool definitely needs some renovation.
Overall overpriced.","Nice staff. Swam in the run down pool, it did its job.

Hotel hasnt been updated since it was built on the 50's. We're closer to the 2050's! Would have been great in its time but not now, zero upgrades, at least to the rooms. Horrible.
It may be on the beach but the beach water is dirtier than a .... you fill out the rest.
It was a literal garbage dump washing up at my feet.
Left 3 days early, cant believe i lasted 2 nights.","Beautiful location with the most amazing views with plenty of activities.
Rooms are clean, bathroom is dated with a build up of soap scum. I guess hard for them to clean being an older building.
Dinner was good. Unfortunately there was no fresh water available to consume for lunch, dinner or breakfast the next day which is an absolute necessity whilst in Bali."

We went to several places to see them. our guide sam took us to the places to have the most peace and quiet. we took the swimming tour with the dolphins it was extraordinary. Thanks a lot",Wow what an experience this was! Our guide was persistent and went out of his way to find loads of dolphins for us to swim with. We were out for an hour more than we had paid for - they went above and beyond to ensure we had a good experience. It‚Äôs amazing seeing these animals in the wild and being able to ‚Äòswim‚Äô alongside them. We felt the price we paid was very good value for the experience we got. Would recommend to anyone.,"At the beginning of the tour I was really excited because we startet with 3 traditional boats in the sunrise. But a few minutes later I was shocked! We have been driven directly in the group of Dolphins- it was like a hunt- too close, too many boats! Around 200!! The dolphins has to breathe. Everytime when they go up the boats went with high speed into the the dolphin group! They dont't get the chance to swim away! You want to make money with these beautiful animals? Ok but then you have to respect them! I would never do this tour again and could definetly not recommend this!","I have mixed opinions on whether or not I enjoyed this experience

It was amazing to see the dolphins, the driver was sweet and the weather was really nice

I‚Äôm not sure how great I feel about chasing pads of dolphins round in 20-30 boats at a time though

That being said, the dolphins seemed playful and could have just swam off if they were scared or threatened I assume

We also swam beside the boat, no one seems to mention the jellyfish??? We got stung loads, nothing serious, but irritating",Super 5 stars Sam was great really patient guy waited till we were the last one leaving the sea. Dolphins watching and swimming with them was super surreal! They swam beneath me beside me! Worth the money!

Recommend to wear long sleeve and not bikini if you‚Äôre swimming with the dolphins as the current may pull the bikini off!",It was a nice little boat ride out and to go snorkeling. But there's literally about 200 boats trying to see two or three dolphins. Makes it impossible to actually enjoy the Dolphins or even see them....................................................................,"This was an amazing experience. I had a great captain - Bidu - who was very relaxed and patient and made this whole journey very pleasant. We chilled on the ocean, waiting for huge swarms of dolphins, I could dive down and hear them through the water. Truly magical.
Also the snorkelling in the reef was fun. Very beautiful fish down there. So many colours and different kinds, totally breathtaking.","Most beautiful experience I‚Äôve ever had. Very nice and super sweet stuff that is making sure to give you a relaxed and amazing experience with the dolphins.
Puts a smile on your face for at least a week.

2. Most of the food that we ordered aren't available

1. The staff acknowledge the situation and apologize in advance.
2. Suggested what to order
3. Never failed apologies for the inconvenience.

My kids loved their Pho Kids too. Portions are generous. opt for the king size if you're a meat enthusiast. Highly recommended!","We arrived at 19.00 on a Thursday night.
There are many people for sure but they are not bus tour group (I see these answers often on the reviews), they are just group of friends of maximum 6 people per table.
The only exciting part is that there‚Äôs finally a decent restaurant in Lovina but the worst part is that we waited 1 hour just for drinks, just 4 Iced Tea!!!
We had our first spring roll out of 2 after 1hour. While we complained about our drinks not arriving, a group of 6 people who arrived after us asked the waiter where the drinks and food are. The waiter told them the wait is around 1 hour.
Why you never told people in the beginning before they order? Before we order? Just because this restaurant is so famous in the Southern Bali part doesn‚Äôt mean they live up to their name.
The king size sandwich here is only as big as a  hand palm unlike the one in Canggu/Denpasar.
Really disappointed with the service. If you can‚Äôt handle a full house then hire more staffs or don‚Äôt accept every guests! If you don‚Äôt expect a full house, have a look and do research on hotels nearby if they are fully booked which means you need more staffs on these kind of days.","Great food. New experience to us.

While the bathroom met our expectations, the garden's well-thought-out design was a highlight.

We ordered some cocktails, pina  colada, Espresso Martini, and Long Island Iced Teas. Everything we tried was really gorgeous and well done.
We ordered lobster thermidor and spring rolls, which were all very tasty and fresh. It's a shame that there were no saute potatoes, and these were replaced with fries, but this didn't spoil the meal, which was very enjoyable.
This place was one of the more pricey places that I visited in Bali. However, for the service, location, and food and drinks, it was worth the money.",Nice view and very attentive service.

They welcome you with you a great foot massage, tea and fruit salad.

Staff is very friendly and helpful.

Only thing that you need to consider is that you can not have dinner there, if whatever reason you want to stay (in our case it was raining a lot), they offer you several menus from the surroundings and they call them and serve them in the hotel; it‚Äôs good but take in consideration that this will increase dinner time as they need to deliver it.",This is my second visit to this hotel for different massages.  They were fabulous.  The hotel is a funky tucked away homestay with a great Yoga vibe to it.  I also went the next day to their sister hotel Dream Hill which has the same wonderful owner.  They offer lots of Yoga retreats with unique offerings.  I checked out a room at both locations and think it would be the perfect getaway to enjoy some Zen time.   Please note:  The photos of the little garden with statues is from the Santhiku hotel and all the others are from the sister hotel Dream Hill.  They share facilities and amenities depending on what it is you are looking for and what type of room and which location you would like to stay at.,"The place definitely has a unique look and I loved the cat and bird living in the hotel. The staff was also very friendly and welcoming. However, there were a couple of downsides to my stay, the uncomfortable bed and not fully functional air conditioning.","Definitely can recommend this place, we went here for two nights and LOVED our stay. Kind staff, amazing breakfast, gorgeous property. This was one of the more expensive properties we stayed at, but we sincerely felt the property did a lot to justify the price. There really are only two downsides, the property owns dogs (some which like to run under your legs at inopportune moments, or even try to run into your room) and there is a local cat (... Which also decided to run into our room and unlike the dogs succeeded) and the walls are really really thin.","I loved this place! Beautiful set up with chill, hippy vibes. I stayed in a private room with my husband and it was adorable (with warm water). We took a yoga class at Dream Hill (also very cool) and would also recommend. Its walking distance from the beach and dolphin statue, friendly staff, and great food m!"

The next morning after check out, we asked a lady of we could still swim and she gave us towels to swim. After 20 minutes another lady got angry at us for staying in the pool after check-out (11:00). She took away the towels and asked us to leave. I stayed at many hotels worldwide (+100) and I've never felt this unwelcome. It felt like we were no guests anymore, because the check out time had past. Even though we paid for the night and we correcly checked out our room at 10:00. In all other hotels, you can still use the facilities after check out. Not nice to treat guests like this...","100000000 thanks to the family hosting this homestay. It was a real pleasure to spend few days and nights at bottlemania ‚ù§Ô∏è
The location is perfect just next to the beach and very safe. The family owning this B&B is very kind, smiling and really like to share moments with their guests. Many activities can be organised from Lovina üê¨ The bedrooms are clean, tall and i liked so much the silence, it was so quiet after a stay in denpasar ! üí§
I‚Äôll advise this establishment to families, backpackers and whoever want to live an authentic exp√©rience in North Bali üôè
Hope to come back one day üíï

PS : please try the banana pancake cooked by Ita it is so yummy !!! üòã","We came to the hotel at 4pm when check in was at 2pm. Our room wasn‚Äôt ready. The lady (big boss) said she is ‚Äúupgrading us‚Äù because of the kids being loud. So we have been waiting and she offered us a ‚Äúwelcome‚Äù inconvenience drink ( we asked for a Beer). She said ok. We got into the room and it was spacious and Wi-Fi worked great. However we have never ever even been asked within 3 days of our stays if we need service in our room or get it cleaned. We wanted to rent scooters and  she wouldn‚Äôt be flexible with us and was trying to rip us off with scooters and ‚Äúdolphin tour‚Äù. So we didn‚Äôt pick her services and maybe that pissed her off. But breakfast comes with juice/fruit and this nice girl that works for her had to ask her for permission to give us juice. She ended up charging us for a welcome inconvenience drink in the end which was supposed to be free. And she sent her husband to do that.Seems like everyone is afraid of her. Long story short there is also a Mosque with 3 speakers on each side of it so at 5am u will hear Prayers and also throughout the day. On top of everything never ending roosters. She wouldn‚Äôt sell us a beer but then charged for the welcome drink. Curtains r very thin, so are walls. U hear everything. Shower been clogged. Workers r nice. But she is such a negative bad vibe i would stay away. Plus location is not the greatest. I don‚Äôt know who wrote those nice reviews but it‚Äôs way too overrated","very interesting place, and has play facilities that don't make you bored while staying, and very close if you want to play to the beach because it's only 200-300 meters away","A very nice place. The owners & employees are very nice and helpful. The rooms could use some improvements, though, such as better door locks & air conditioning."
