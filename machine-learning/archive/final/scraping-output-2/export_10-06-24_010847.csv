The staff are so kind & helpful, always happy. The food & drinks were amazing also! The diving centre is incredible, and so are the team. We felt very well looked after and the friendly team put my mind at ease when needed (my first time diving). Very grateful for this 10/10 team - highly recommend. Thanks again everyone for making our stay INCREDIBLE.","My wife and I chose Deep Roots as one of our honeymoon holiday stays. We stayed 4 nights and completed the open water diving course. We loved it. The resort staff were so friendly and welcoming and picked us up from the harbour. The rooms were clean and had breathtaking views of the island and Mt Agung. The diving was the highlight of our whole honeymoon and we had the amazing instructor Georgia who walked us through a day of pool diving and then 3 days of open water dives. We were total novices, then became certified open water divers in 3 days. I highly recommend staying and diving with this resort!","Incredible stay at Deep Roots! I will return in the future. The property is stunning, the dive center has excellent equipment and well trained instructors / dive masters. The spa treatments and Yoga classes were also great. The food and drink was excellent. The highlight of this resort is the staff however. They could no do enough to help us out and make our stay very enjoyable and relaxing. Fisson and his team in the resort as well as Chris and his team at the dive center all did an incredible job and made our stay very personable. I highly recommend to stay here!","I travelled to Nusa Penida with my mom mainly to see the island attractions and to get our open water diving license. We chose Deep Roots because of the location and the diving center located in the hotel.
Deep roots offered us so much more than we expected (and we were already expecting a lot from the reviews) - we got the warmest welcome and felt like being part of a family.
Everyone was exceptionally nice. The rooms were very clean, very nice architecture. The food and drinks were very good as well - nothing to complain about. We loved the atmosphere and got to meet a lot of cool people and made new friends!
Also it‚Äôs a great location for visiting the island (it‚Äôs about one hour to the sights in both directions).

The diving course was incredible. Heskia was our diving instructor (only for the two of us - we were expecting more people to be in a group) and we couldn‚Äôt have wished for a better instructor. We did the pool sessions on the first day, and then had two days of diving in the ocean (2x2 dives).
The team made us feel safe at all times!
BIG thanks to Chris for the quick and easy reservation and organisation!

We will definitely be back and will recommend it to everyone! Thank you üôè","Stop reading reviews and book your stay here, you won‚Äôt regret it! The five stars for Deep Roots is totally justified. Everything here is superb from the lovely and friendly staff, to the restaurant food, yoga, and massages. The pool view is fabulous and the activities offered are great. Highly recommend the East/west island tour and diving. We did a fun dive with Dimas and Georgia and they were awesome! We hope to come back some day!"

I loved the plates decor they used for their coffee. I had the wake me up before you cocoa smoothie ü•£ and she had the build your own breakfast with poached eggs. I loved the smoothie bowl! Lush and rich, tasty, and had a very nice texture. The espresso was very nice and strong. The pineapple and orange juices were watered down and tasted funky. Wouldn't get those again.","My son and I went here for breakfast and loved it. The food was not only delicious but also served piping hot. The staff were courteous the service was fantastic.

We asked to be showed around the property as we were curious to see their rooms and facilities. They have a yogashala with great instructors. I tried one of their vinyasa sessions which was great.

We would definitely love to come stay here next time!","We couldn't be more pleased. We had both breakfast, lunch and dinner and all meals were absolutely top. Quite a large selection. Everyone chooses. Vegetarian, meat or sweet lover. Interesting combinations that were a gourmet experience for us - for example, cauliflower with pumpkin hummus and lentil salad. We liked it very much. Very good prices. The service is genuinely kind and friendly. Highly recommended.","This place is a great place to stay and just pop in for food. We stopped her along the way to a beach and overall no regrets.
The place is clean, stylish, well maintained and got a view of the pool looking towards the open island waters.
We ordered a couple of juices; 1. Pineapple and 1 orange. And they were more so disappointing as they tasted watered down. I've had pure fresh squeezed orange juice many times and this was nothing like that.
My partner had an expresso served in a beautiful little cup and plate which he really loved the strength and taste of.
For food he got the smoothie bowl which he absolutely loved and I got a build your own plate. Came with 2 eggs (eggs done between poached, fried or boiled. I got mine poached. The eggs were good but something about the eggs in these parts is different...that's the best I can describe it. It doesn't have the same thickness to them. The wedges were nice nothing special, in fact a bit more crispier and a pinch more of salt would have been better. They bacon was alright and the sourdough was good. It was true sourdough which I loved.
For the quality of food I think the prices are a bit much. That's my personal feelings.
Good thing is if you psy by card they don't add any extra % of charge","Beautiful place, atmosphere and service‚òÄÔ∏è you can see that the owners created this place with love and care üôèüèºüíó
Good selection of drinks , alcoholic, non-alcoholic , coffee and tasty and fragrant teas ü´ñüçµ

We came for dinner tonight and we will definitely come again üòäüíó
Excellent food and lots of vegan options üå±üíóü•≥ Be sure to try it!
Especially the Jackfruit burger is really amazing ü§§üçî
We also had vegan appetizers. Everything was just great ü•≥ü§©ü§§üíó
There is a lot to choose from.. so You will definitely choose too ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Signal reception is very bad here, and the wifi connection isn‚Äôt too stable.

The room is not equipped with soundproofed walls.",It's the best for the price. The room is not the most sound proof. The hot water works. The AC is OK. I also meet this cat üò∫,"Had a great stay here, and the owner was very friendly and helpfull and helped us carry the bags to the motorbike. Also the food was good!","This is the second time staying here and we're still in love with this place. A very quite stay in the middle of the mountain with beautiful green surrondings.

Big, clean rooms and a nice little seating outside to enjoy the wonderful view.
We also love the family owners and it was a bless to meet them again. Always friendly and helpful.

We recomend renting a scooter or driver to take you around. The island is not that big so you have plenty of time exploring.

Thank you! And say hi to your cute cats from us. See you again!","This place is beautiful!! Located among nature you have amazing views from your bungalow since the garden is very well taken care of.. you also get top service with the breakfast of your choice every morning delivered to your front door!! The bungalows have everything you need, including hot water and ac! 100% would recommend staying here! They even let you use the kitchen if you need! Thank you for everything"

It‚Äôs run by a very lovely woman. The rooms are clean and modern and very spacious. Beds are comfy! Breakfast is served every morning on the terrace. Only a short drive from the main roads. You really get some much out of this property, especially for the price. Highly recommend staying here if you‚Äôre in Nusa Penida!","Very clean, comfortable and stylish rooms. Staff are very friendly and helpful. A bit inland so this gives great jungle views right at your doorstep, but makes it a bit inconvenient if you don't have a scooter. Only a 10 minute drive to the north beach though where there's plenty restaurants, bars, dive schools etc.","The Pancor Jungle resort is a small, family-run hotel located in a quiet area of Nusa Penida. The hotel has a total of 5 cottages, each with a private balcony or terrace with stunning views. The cottages are simple but clean and comfortable, and all have air conditioning, hot water, and a TV.
The staff at the Pancor Jungle resort are friendly and helpful, and they are always happy to give recommendations for things to do in the area.

Overall, the Pancor Jungle resort is a great option for travelers looking for a budget-friendly hotel with beautiful views and a convenient location.","We had been a group of 10 people, and we made the reservation in advance for 5 rooms for 1 night. When we arrived there, the girl told us that there had been a mistake on their side and gave only 4 rooms, giving the option of a supplimentary bed, meaning only one mattress. And they wanted to charge us for the 5 rooms, not 4. The room was not cleaned, we did not eat there as the kitchen was not clean (If we can call it as kitchen, as it was a room), even if the breakfast was included. Terrible experience.
Also, wanted to buy some bottles of water,  however, the water bottles were already open and most probably they reuse things from previous renters.","Super nice accommodation. Very clean, big rooms, nice terrace, just 3 minutes with scooters to bars and restaurants.
And she is taking amazing care of her guests. Welcomes you with bananas and drinks. Rents scooter for a fair price and helped us with our laundry. We extended our stay and would stay again."
ChIJIwnlf9dz0i0RSrMrtBLpwXY,Penida yurt,-8.693928,115.5064348,"Ped, Nusa Penida, Klungkung Regency, Bali 80771, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=8557377033522099018,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-4667-3474,bed_and_breakfast,"bed_and_breakfast, lodging",4.5,39,,"I checked out of the penida yurt today and had a terrible experience because of the rascist attitude of the owner Francis. It was such a shocker that it almost made me feel I will never return to Nusa Penida!
1. Francis doesn't stay at the property which is run by Indonesian staff alone who do not speak much English.
This is fine because Indonesians are really friendly people and the staff was ever smiling. We got by on hand gestures and Google translate.
2. We were confused on whether breakfast is included in our booking and we asked the staff. The staff told us that breakfast is included. As we were checking out, I asked for our bills and saw a charge for breakfast. Being unsure, I said to the staff can you check on this because you had earlier said it's included. The staff then confirmed to me that it's not and I immediately took out the money to pay for it.
3. By this time, Mr. Francis got on the phone and this is where things got really rude! I was explaining the situation to him and saying that the staff had told us differently and so I asked them to cross check. I also said that I don't want an argument and I'm in any case paying the bill. I then said he should consider putting a board up that queries should be directed to him because the staff may misunderstand and I said I'll put that in my review.
4. Even till that juncture, I had not considered putting a negative review since this was just a misunderstanding, but then Mr. Francis said  to me - ""you go ahead and put in review - people from your country are all making trouble."" This is when I was truly shocked. I never expected this nature of rascism.
5. I was upset and told Mr. Francis that is uncalled for and he cut the phone. Realising that the staff is just not understanding what's happening - I used Google translate to assure them that I'm upset because he said bad things for my country. My anger is not for them - ""he says about my country so I am angry. not with you. you are good staff"" - ""dia mengatakan tentang negaraku jadi aku marah.  tidak denganmu.  kamu adalah staf yang baik""

On the stay itself - the yurt is good. The family yurt is big and comfortable with good beds and amenities. Expect some ants and creepy crawlies since it's a yurt. No one else was staying there and it felt isolated. The location is also far off from shops and cafes. It's an experience but one I'll avoid just because of Francis. Indonesians are lovely people. Will prefer a local run place next time.","Had a trip to Bali for 3 weeks, during which we stayed on Nusa penida for 4 nights in one of Francis ‚ÄúYurts‚Äù.  We absolutely loved it -  these accommodations are very cozy, they have everything you could need, there is a big swimming pool as well as they rent scooters right on the spot. Fantastic breakfast + Francis makes some delicious restaurant level dinners, which is a must to have if you stay there!
We recommend it to everyone 10/10! üòä","Beautiful yurts, overall a good place to stay for a good price. The host Francis is really the best host you can imagine. He is very friendly and helps you with everything you need...scooter, taxi, boat to Bali and more.
We really enjoyed our stay here and would come back anytime.

The location is a bit outside so you need a scooter to get to restaurants or the beach. But with scooter it is not a problem. In 5-10 minutes you can be at the beach or in the center. It depends on where you are going.","What a great place! We had a lovely stay at the yurt for 3 nights. The pricing, the food, the yurt itself (spacious and soft bed!) its all GOOD. Glamping at its finest. The host, Francis, helped us out with so much (motorbike, boat to Penida and Gili, other recommendations) which made our stay so pleasant. Go for a rented motorbike and the island is full of discoveries. Enjoy!","Kb and I are friends who travel together, and what the boss replied below is not what happened to us.  From here you will know how unfriendly the boss is and how often he conflicts with people. I advise you not to stay here. There are many villas with better quality and better service on this island."

The Bungalow got cleaned¬†every day and the bed was so comfy, we really enjoyed our stay there!

Ingrid herself was such¬†a charming and wonderful host. She and her cute dogs live next to the Bungalow,¬†so we met her every day in the morning and in the evening for a little chat and¬†she gave us useful tips for our stay at beautiful island Nusa Penida.
She also picked us up at¬†the pier and offered her help every time. It just felt like staying at a friend‚Äôs¬†place!

We would warmly¬†recommend Ingrid‚Äôs Place! If we once come back to Nusa Penida, we would stay¬†here again!

This is just a perfect place to be! Nice, clean and calm bungalows with a lovely host Ingrid. She helps with everything you need, serving breakfast and speaks the best english we have ever experienced from any local person in Indonesia!

Especially when you love dogs you will feel more than home, with amazing three puppies and three adult dogs (at that time). If not don't worry they won't bother you much :).

It was so much fun to stay, sadly only two nights :(. Hope to come back one day to visit Ingrid and her dog family!","I booked 4 nights here and loved it! Ingrid is the best host. She will give you great tips on how to make the most of your time on the island if you don't already have an itinerary. She also has 7 dogs (mostly rescue dogs) which is awesome! Proper hot showers, beautiful log cabins, air con that actually works - and dogs!! 10 stars!","Have very pleasant stay during the New Year eve here. The owner so friendly and gave suggestions for the tourist spots and also the places to eat, and all were worth it. The location might quite far from main road, but good for you who love peaceful place and just want to have relaxing day on the island. The bungalow also clean and the breakfast were so yummy. Definitely will stay in this bungalow again if visit Nusa Penida again."
