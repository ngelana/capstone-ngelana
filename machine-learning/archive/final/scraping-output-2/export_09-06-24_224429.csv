ChIJF-o-m6-D0S0RJNh_XeJMjso,2 Bali Melali ( Trails and Lunch ),-8.246186699999999,114.9610419,"Jl. Kiskinda, Mayong, Kec. Seririt, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81153, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=14595687977469335588,OPERATIONAL,+62 817-4700-795,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,5,41,,"This was a great outing!  Putu was an amazing guide who clearly knows and is excited to share about the plants and local area. He was personable and engaging and even brought pictures to explain the various species, including snacks to try some. He helped our kids see and learn and we came away with much more information than just about rice terraces.

After the hike, lunch (and cool towels!) at his home was so lovely. We met his kind and helpful wife Rita and really enjoyed our time with them as well as all the delicious food they prepared.

Highly recommend!","This tour will take you through villages, small farms, and lush paddy fields. The vibrant greenery of the paddy fields is truly breathtaking, and we were fortunate with our timing to witness the paddy plants before the ripening stage, which means the view was beautifully green everywhere. Putu, our guide, is a cool chap, easy to get along with and knows how to crack a joke or two. His wife, Ria, treated us to a culinary masterpiece for lunch, and her friendly personality added to the already wonderful experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the walk and highly recommend it, especially for those seeking their first encounter with the enchanting beauty of a paddy field. We booked the tour via WhatsApp and Putu is quick to respond.","A great experience to help us understand the daily life and farming community of Bali. Our kids were able to connect what they learned in school to real life.  Putu was entertaining and knowledgeable.  His sense of humor kept us asking questions and learning.  Also he customized our tour for the needs of our group. Just when we thought the best was over, we went to Putu and Rita’s home for lunch. Rita is the real crown jewel of the Bali.  She was hospitable, kind and generous.  The meal was delicious.  It was the most our kids ate while they were in Bali. If given an opportunity we would return to dine with Rita.","Great hike that comes across beautiful nature and agriculture. It’s an easy and comfortable walk and Putu (the guide) has great stories and knowledge about the local culture. Afterwards we got treated to an amazing authentic Indonesian feast (calling it a lunch doesn’t do it justice) by Rita and Dom the dog also made a suprise appearance. Lovely time, amazing people and worth every cent. Thank you!",Putu showed us the nature with all the variety off plants and fruits and also the rise fields. After a very interesting walk of 2 hours we came back and Ria prepared a very nice lunch. And also we tasted the King and Queen of the fruit the Dorian and Mangosteen. If you’re here we can advise you to do this walk.
