It's within walking distance to Keramas Beach, making it convenient for beach-goers. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. Excellent choice for those seeking a quiet retreat.","Amazing place, you can get room delivery food at all time, reasonable price and lovely staff","The owner helped us a lot booking a ferry to Gili islands! Even dropped us in the harbor for free‚Ä¶ he really cares for his costumers!
Nice hotel, beautiful outside area! Everything is like in the pictures! Would recommend this place for everyone!","This is a small hotel right next to some rice fields. The pool surrounded by green plants was nice.

There are two main things that keep me from giving this place a higher rating:
- the quilt did not come with a duvet cover which I guess is not uncommon here in Indonesia. However, there were a few small blood stains on the quilt which was very unpleasant.
- my boyfriend and I wanted to travel by boat to Gili Air which one of the staff members wanted to help us arrange. That was nice of him, but the price he offered for transfer and boat was 2,2 million rupiah (he said the price was originally 2,4 million but he wanted to give us some discount). We booked online and got transfer and boat for 750k total which saved us a lot of money. So make sure you book your own tickets!

Answer: you must be mistaking me for another guest. I never had a bike while staying with you, and you never took me to the harbour."
