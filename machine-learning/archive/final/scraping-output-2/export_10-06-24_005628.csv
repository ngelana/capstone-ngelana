Portion used to be bigger, do note of inconsistencies or unfairness of size, you can get few lawar in your plate like in my photo or fewer and look at another customer gets twice or thrice your portion and they paid the same.","I had my lunch here after doing purification in Pura Luhur Tamba Waras, the food is great, tasty. Sadly, the parking area is a little bit small. It is better for you to use motorcycle rather than car. But overall, it is great

My personal observation based on scale 1 to 5, from very bad, bad, okay, good, very good.

Taste: 5/5
Price: 2/5 little pricey
Parking area: 2/5
Staff: 5/5
Location: 5/5
Recommended: yes, totally recommended","Balinese comfort food, served in 2 various meat, pork and beef. I had the pork and it tasted good, a little bit spicy to my preference. The price is reasonable, IDR 90k for 2 persons. It has quite spacious parking lot and you can park your car on the side of the road as well. Expect busy hours at lunch time","Was brought to try the food here by local Balinese. They have only two dishes to choose from, pork or beef rice. But the food was good and very affordable. Just keep in mind that it can be quite spicy","Luluk stalls located in the ship area, Badung has been established for more than 30 years is a legendary food stall in Bali. with a simple food menu but the taste remains the same from many years and with a fairly cheap price makes this food menu always runs out before it's time to close"
