If you want to enjoy a good day in Ubud Area amidst the art and creativity, I‚Äôd recommend you to skip rice terrace and instead go for this art gallery! Beautiful creations by local artisans will leave you in awe!

It cost us 50k per person! You can choose to get an elaborate shoot done at extra cost! However, with basic entry ticket also you will find the staff helping you through out taking amazing pictures and videos for you at no extrava charge‚Äô","the entrance fee will include 3 places. the first one is for this art gallery, the 2nd one is the glass factory, and the last is the restaurant and the pool. the art gallery is where the magical pool located. the actual area is very small but they planted many deer antler plants and make us feel mystical being inside there. they also install fake smoke effect at the koi pool to add the feeling. it's very cool and nice to take photo, just don't be surprise because the place is small. but you can take more photos in the last area where the restaurant and the pool located","Yes, it's an unfinished project and the whole place is really small but it's worth for a nice Instagrammable photos. We asked for traditional Balinese outfits and the camera guys (they shoot with iPhone and my phone) did nice job. It took 15 minutes to dress up and 15 for taking photos and videos. My wife was super happy.","50k for foreign and 25k for local, I can say not to worth it. From start to end, you only have a couple of steps and finish. Even the spot for taking a picture is only one spot. When I go there, I even local people say better to monkey forest ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è when I see the place named Art Gallery, I thought of a lot of art but no","Beautiful and breathtaking atmosphere will be offered during your visit this Art Galery. Big handcrafted wooden sculptures are diplayed to be seen and enjoyed. Finally is about 300 meters away, you will find a restaurant surrounded with beautiful landscape and huge spots for your family photos. For these two places you will be charged with 50k rupiah. You will be guided from friendly staff for looking around and for taking pictures as well."

We had an in room massage, incredibly relaxing and wonderful staff. Room service was delivered promptly and everything was delicious.
We also booked a private cooking lesson, held at sunset on the deck overlooking the rice fields . Unique and beautiful experience.
All the staff were wonderful, the hospitality was unmatched.","We stayed here for 2 nights and i wished we stayed longer! The staff are very accommodating, from airport transfer to our whole stay they are the best! The breakfast is amazing with so many choices, they have in house massage and restaurant. They gave us welcome fruits and cake for our anniversary which is really thoughtful of them. Overall, its perfect! When we go back to Ubud, this is going to be the place we will surely book.","I am in hospitality management and pay attention to detail. This place and staff are EVERYTHING. We had 1 small issue at the very end with laundry and Pasek handled it with perfection. I've stayed at 5 places in Indonesia, this by far was my favorite location. They have perfected service and after being here in Bali I don't know how it's possible that I didn't get 1 mosquito bite üôåüèΩ. All the other locations I got bit up and was scared to use the outdoor bathroom. Great service, food, Location and design.

I WILL BE BACK!","Nua Villa in Bali is an exceptional retreat. The customer service was brilliant, with staff being incredibly attentive to every need. The food was amazing, offering rich and fresh flavors. The atmosphere was serene and spacious, perfect for relaxation. The incredible pool provided a great view and was a highlight of my stay. Overall, Nua Villa offers a luxurious and unforgettable experience.","My husband and I chose Nau Villa for our honeymoon and we couldn‚Äôt be happier! We were in Villa 5 and loved the room and view. The staff was so great! Almost everyone we ordered on the menu was delicious. Highlights were the cooking class, the massage, the yoga class and the romantic candle lit dinner. We were looked after so well and left feeling relaxed. Highly recommend!"

The photo spots were truly captivating, offering picturesque backdrops that transport you to another world.

Located just around 30 minutes from Ubud, it's conveniently accessible. However, the surprise came with the entry ticket price of Rp50.000, which might be steep for some.

Nevertheless, the ticket grants access to two stunning photo areas, making it somewhat justifiable. Surprisingly, the restaurant, which is the second spot, also requires an entry ticket.

Despite this, they provide an amateur phone photographer to assist in capturing moments ‚Äì a thoughtful touch for Rp50.000. Overall, if you're keen on capturing memorable moments or simply seeking a charming spot for quality time with loved ones, Sari Timbul is worth considering.""","This is a magical kingdom, nothing i have ever seen before. Can‚Äôt really decide where to begin. Super nice installations, vegetation, kind staff and delightful juices. And the mandatory jungle view:) Must visit destination for all who come to Bali",What an incredible place! The wood work pieces they have there are incredible ! The place is so unique and beautiful. I would highly recommend visiting during your stay in Bali!,"Unique place with a lot of Photo Spot. The closing time actually inaccurate, if you're in the area they still serve you even google says it's closed. The owner is very friendly, superb services. Very recommended. üëçüëçüëç"

Ask for Bubuh Bali vegetarian or Mie goreng vegetarian. Enjoy with egg (telor) if you like. Good choice of hot and cold tea as well as gelato sticks.,We went here twice to eat and the food is just delicious and cheap! Although it close to Ubud's famous rice field both time there were not to much tourists.,"Very nice and simple restaurant a warung style with a beautiful rice field backyard, open air with a simple roof. The food is great, specializing in Bubuh Bali (Balinese Porridge with vegetables)  and Rice Cake with boiled vegetables with peanut sauce is so good (Tipat Santo) , the fruit salad (rujak kuah pindang) is good too. None of the food here is disappointing me, all come with a very reasonable price, I might say cheap.","This restaurant has lack of parking area. You will be confused to park your car if you want to visit here.

Located on the side of rice field, it has many choices of tasty food. They give very fair price of its alimentation.","Bubuh Bali is a typical Balinese food that is almost rarely found in Bali because it is usually only sold by old traders, this food is in the form of porridge on top of which is sprinkled with spicy and fruitful vegetables, here the taste of the porridge is delicious and spicy, just right with the cold atmosphere here but if you don't like it  spicy we can ask for something that is not spicy or ask for something that is less spicy, the price is very friendly because the location of this place is in the countryside so the price is still in accordance with the pockets of the local community who are very impressive in this place besides the view of the rice fields and the beautifully arranged gardens as well as several scattered gazebos.  when I arrived and it was raining, the employee was waiting for me at the car door with an umbrella ... hhhmmm impressive service."

Thanks to Made and his family who were very kind and welcoming during my stay. I highly recommend and will come back!,"I chose this place because of the people who gave it 5 stars. When I left, there wasn't even one customer, and there wasn't even an owner. It was like an abandoned place. I tried to reach the owner because I paid in advance through Agoda, I couldn't reach it. I waited for the time to be 14:00, but still no one came. It's a mess, it's a disgrace.  And it's in a very difficult place as a location. It's like fear at night .  As a result, agoda canceled my reservation and I got rid of it.","If you want to experience the village lifestyle, away from crowd and traffic and stay near to the nature, I‚Äôll recommend you to stay here.

You will be literally surrounded by rice field and sometimes you could‚Äôve seen some fireflies in the evening.","Super chilled place and owner , Feeling of being fully immersed in both the natural surroundings and the spirit of Bali .Perfect place to unwind ,slow down and rest , w always the option of meeting fellow travellers there and share the peace and tranquility. Well worth the journey up there , and just one night will never be enough ."

The resort has some spectacular views, but the service is very bad and we were the only customers. We wanted to have dinner there, but after they were not able to provide half of stuff on the menu, we decided to stick to drinks only. It also felt a bit overpriced.
