Lots of marble light, nice furniture and soft. Nice elevators and even 2 elevators.
The room is nice, nice floor color, and wooden parquet not just tile.
But a lot of details and minuses.
1. the big overhead shower head almost didn't work.
2. Although what is the point of the shower head if there is no hot water. We waited 10 minutes and then called to ask, some man came in the night and then hot water appeared. In the morning there was no water again, we did not call again.....
3. The lights around the perimeter of the main did not work at all,. One of the four bulbs was barely blinking.
4. Without a key card air conditioning does not work. We arrived to just a vdski-hot room, with a correspondingly bad odor. The first impression is not a pleasant one.
Air conditioning is bad and slow, turned on at 16¬∞ and strong speed at 8pm, but it didn't get cool and comfortable until 3am. Very long time to wait.
In general, the hotel seems good but the price tag is clearly inflated.
By the way the gym is good. I liked it.","When it comes to considering your accommodation options, the Four Star at Trans Hotel is definitely worth mentioning. We had the pleasure of staying at this hotel from 25th March to 1st April, and we must say, our experience was exceptional.

It's important to highlight that this was a business trip involving 51 students and 3 staff members. The fact that the rooms were pre-arranged before our group's arrival greatly contributed to the efficiency of our check-in process. It was incredibly fast and streamlined, allowing all members of our large group to settle in without any delays.

Handling such a sizable group can be quite challenging, but the Four Star at Trans Hotel managed it with exceptional ease. From ensuring that all rooms were prepared and ready for our arrival to providing assistance throughout our stay, the hotel staff demonstrated remarkable professionalism and efficiency in managing group bookings.

This seamless coordination undoubtedly enhanced our overall experience at the hotel. It's a testament to the hotel's commitment to providing excellent service and ensuring the satisfaction of all guests, regardless of group size. We were thoroughly impressed by their ability to cater to our needs and make our business trip a seamless and enjoyable experience.

The hotel's facilities and rooms were also very satisfying. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, equipped with all the necessary amenities to make us feel at ease. Additionally, the hotel's other facilities such as the gym and swimming pool added to the enjoyment of our stay.

Lastly, we must mention the hotel's location. The Four Star is situated in a convenient location with many restaurants and shopping mall nearby.

Overall, we are extremely pleased with our stay at the Four Star at Trans Hotel. Their excellent service, comfortable rooms, and convenient location made our trip perfect. We highly recommend this hotel, and we are confident you'll have a pleasant and memorable stay as well.","Room space & cleanliness good. Food taste good although not many variety. Problem with TV remote & plumbing when check-in, but the staff fixed it immediarely. Parking space also limited, but they provide vallet for free.","Hotel was expensive for what it is. Much better prices in better locations. Rooms smell like smoke. Loud atmosphere at night. Laundry service was 800,000 for one load and they did not tell the prices before the service.

Their special menu is several ""es kopi susu"" with various flavour syrup and will come with sweet for sure. I decided to get affogato so i can try the espresso and had ice cream with choco granule.","If you‚Äôre looking for cozy coffee shop in Denpasar, i reccomend this place that you should visit. The place is cery unique because this coffee shop is nestled inside a scool with the spacious indoor and outdoor seating areas.

There may be problems with the ordering system when I place an order, but the waiter is ready to help take orders manually at any time.

The presentation of the food was good, it's just that the fried rice ordered was quite burnt, according to my colleague it wasn't enjoyable enough, but for the rib soup the portion was filling and delicious.","Amazing Indonesian cafe/restaurant. üëå

Indonesian food is never wrong. They have a pretty wide selection of menu, Indonesian food of course. Almost all of the menu that I tasted, tasted so good. üòç

It's a good place to hangout with your friends, family, or partner. Also a great place for kids because there is a mini playground in the outdoor area.","No negative things to say! The tahu telur was tasty, good size portion, saucey, enough tofu in every bite, and the shrimp chips was a great addition. For dessert I got the es palu butung and that was delicious!

But but the aircon is just too weak and making the dining experience too hot & warm to enjoy our food","Visited at afternoon, around 2-3PM. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Good place for who craving an Indonesian dishes.
Nice place with kids playground.

Food:

The Rawon was nice, served with salted egg, rice and Emping but, i preferred rawon served with shrimp crakers.

The Sup Gulai was nice, a bit salty.

The Singkong Goreng was good, soft, but a bit plain in taste.

Tempe mendoan was okay, maybe a bit too thick for me.

The drinks and dessert was excellent.

Parking:

Pretty spacious parking spot, maybe around 5-6 medium SUV can fit."

4.Changing the bed linen costs 120k. The bedding looks unpleasant.
5.The washing machines have been broken for a year; only one is working properly.
6.The owners are completely uncommunicative, remembering tenants only at the time of payment.

This accommodation has left a lot of negative emotions and stress.","1.room was clean and nice view
2.staff was so kind and helpful
3.there‚Äôs free laundry room I recommend for long stay
This was my first overseas trip
i had a great time","Pros:
1. Modern and Clean Room
2. Humble and Helpful Staff
3. Lots of natural light
4. Good location

Cons:
1. Unfriendly, rude and dishonest owners - 5 Million Rp deposit was not refunded even though we gave more than a month's notice. They say because the reservation was canceled we lose the deposit.No rental agreement, no invoices, no paperwork whatsoever which is illegal. They dont ask for copies of passports or id's. We will be reporting them to the Balinese authorities.
2. No management. These people should not be running any type of hospitality business as they have zero customer service and management skills.
3. No rules or system in place. Tenants get to do as they like without any consequences. The Japanese lady and daughter in room 101 are absolute maniacs and have no respect for neighbors. Slamming doors and noise from 4:30am - maniac in room 101 and screaming kids at the pool will destroy your peace of mind. Tenants using all three washing machines at the same time again because there are no rules.
4. Broken shower handle in room 106 which was never repaired they can't even replace batteries in the aircon and TV remotes. Washing machines get blocked often due to lack of cleaning.
5. The entrance road is in very poor condition and will be flooded when raining.
6. They charge for changing the linen and car parking.

Don't be fooled by some good reviews on Google the owners are con artists and make rules when it suits them. If I had more time I would sue them for the 5 million Rp and would win as there is no rental contract.

We stayed for 4 months purely because of the ideal location. We became good friends with the staff especially Ketut which we believe could run the building better than the owners. It's safe to say we will never return.","Very good interior and design. Helpful & humble staff, the pool is sooo comfortable. I love the ambience and the place so much.

Staffs were acting like they were the coolest bunch of people. Seriously need to IMPROVE on their hospitality.

Those things were still pretty tolerable. But what disappoint me was during payment. THEY ROUND UP YOUR BILL WITHOUT PERMISSION. It‚Äôs really not about the money here, but it would be nice if the owners have some nice business ethics.

To round up your customer‚Äôs bill is definitely not a good gesture. Even mini marts asked their customers for permission when they want to round up the bill.",Nice place inside commercial garden. The food is OK but not that special and service too long for the kind of food they have. We're waiting for half an hour for a rice bowl and they're onky less than handful customer.,"Awesome services!

This place offers a good, quiet, comfy place to rest. Being not in main street means you need to find your way in a little bit though.",Everything was basically great main reason I don't want to give this place a 5 star rating is it's location as it is positioned a fair way away from the beach.
