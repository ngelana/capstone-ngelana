There are car accesses but very steep road.

Villas were nicely designed and can accomodate enough people. The views are amazing

Restaurant inside has bad service, we asked them to prepare dinner and they said it was buffet, but ended up with limited food, they didn't even refill the plates once.","1 night stay during retreat from our church. Love the weather, but that time we stay at dorm-style room, and we expect more privacy. The room was bit dusty and the bathtub was little bit too mossy","To be honest I was surprised to know the price was so cheap for such an excellent service and superb cozy and peaceful villa like this. I had vacation with my cousins, total 10 people of us. We got 10 comfortable beds; 4 downstair and 6 upstair, we got living room, TV with sofas, many plates, glasses, cups, spoons, forks, teas, coffee, sugar, mineral water plus dispenser.

2 bathrooms/toilets, 2 big cabinets, 2 wastafels and toiletries, many towels.

Every bed had lamp, and yes... WiFi with good connection!

The view was amazing!
Both sunrise and sunset! So peaceful!

Don't forget to capture your moment at the swimming pool; infinity swimming pool with gorgeous view to the forest and rice field, and green view of trees.

I give 9.2/10 for this place!
Really recommended with affordable price!
Gonna visit this place every month!","Great place for team work, provide software development services, client can stay for a while in our mountain view private villas, swimming or play football in our grean natural playground while break the meeting and enjoy Indonesian food in restaurant in the area, what a wonderful place to work: eat, pray and code","A very nice place for training, workshop, relaxing with family or colleague. A place with beautiful natural landscape view, with well trained staff will serve you. Bumbu Desa restaurant will open soon."
