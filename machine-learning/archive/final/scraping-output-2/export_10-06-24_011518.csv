Good for work, reading or just me time. Introvert approved üòÇ I tried:
- dirty caramel latte 8/10
using caramel sauce, not syrup, it is very tasty. coffee bean using toraja, not that sour or acidic,

- pb&j brownie 8/10
the savory style of brownies, love how they are generous  with the pb&j, i mean, the taste and texture are there, you know. love it.

both item for 75k ( I changed the milk to almond, so regular milk will be cheaper).

parking lot limited, better use motor bike.","It's a great place with good coffee and great people. A lot of freelancers come here to work and socialize with each other. I accidentally broke a glass of coffee, they brought me new coffee right away, even though I didn't even ask for it. I still left money for the glass of course, it was my fault. If you want a sugar-free matcha, you'd better take it with you and ask to make a drink just for your matcha, my friend and I did so, it came out delicious. Great place to have a drink, socialize with friends, work and meet other people. Great atmosphere and great people serving you. I recommend",Hidden gem. Coffee here is good.

It is incredibly cheap, yet the vibe is really nice, AND the food and drinks are actually really good.

I had the grill, which is similar to what you would have in a Korean barbecue. The 3 meats were all very fresh, and the sauces were fantastic. It came with lettuce and 2 portions of rice. It was too much for me. It is a meal for 2, at 75K. Unbeatable price for that quality.

The staff is good although doesn't really pay attention to what happens at the back, where I was sitting.

The music was good, kind of lounge and not too loud.

I will definitely come back often to this one.","Great First Impression,,,

The bakso aci komplit and the bakso urat kecil are not to be missed. Without doubt this is the best bakso aci I have had in my life so far. It is really out of this world. The best time to go is before the lunch rush hour at 11 am.

The staff and the owner are friendly and helpful. I thoroughly recommend this kedai bakso aci to anybody who loves delicious meatballs in Bali. A return visit are on the cards !","Surprisingly super worth it and delicious! I bought bakso cuanki super komplit. It came with fresh limau.  The soup was clear but rich, the portion was big. It was totally scrumptious! The presentation and the place is very clean and hygienic. They also serve our food with gloves. There are tissues on the table, covered cutlery, and the straws even come with plastic. Open from Tuesday-Sunday (Monday off), from 1pm-10pm.  Available on Grab, Shopee Food, and GoFood.  In addition to cash, the payment method can be OVO, Qris, Shopeepay, etc. Definetely would come here again to try another menu.

Well, i get why they got high rating, it's cheap.
Portion is BIG
(But not exactly for my taste) *WELL, NOW IT IS!

Nevertheless the chicken meatball was quite good.   I will try other food they have next time.

But for the time being... For meaty meat balls, not really for me , but for *starchy chewy BALLS (aka Baso Aci) with its condiments and snacks, they are THE BEST!"

It is really beautiful with a chilled atmosphere. The staff was very welcoming, with the right level of attention.

I had the sate, which was very good (although the meat was a bit too fatty for my liking) and the free mineral water.

It was 6 pm but not busy at all, so I could work in peace.

The place is very leafy, and mosquitoes had a great time with my legs. I'll definitely make sure to apply repellent next time I visit.","I am surprised of this hidden place.
