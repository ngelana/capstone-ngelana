This hotel is an absolute gem. The service was excellent and the rooms are lovely. We only did a quick overnight but both my husband and I wanted to stay longer and when we return, this will be a ‚Äòmust‚Äô stop. The pool is heated and looks amazing (was raining when we arrived so weren‚Äôt able to indulge) with a beautiful view of the surrounding jungle. Before check out I sat on our veranda and enjoyed the peace and solitude. Highly recommend.","Good place to hide away from the hustle n bustle. We stayed in a villa room. The room is spacious, good bed, and good amenities. The room comes with the free netflix, you don't have to login to your own account.

Balcony has rocking chairs that you can use to enjoy the nature. Room is quiet, you can only hear nature sound at night.

Don't expect an AC in the room since the area is in high altitude. Room has a ceiling fan and a room heater.

Perfect place for honeymoon or romantic getaway.","I'm not a fan of bugs, so keep that in mind for this review.

The room had bugs like moths, flies, and slugs, but I get it's in a jungle, so bugs are expected. The room felt damp, especially the bed, which wasn't comfy. On the bright side, the bathroom was big and clean. They give you four free water bottles, which is cool.

Dinner was tasty, especially the ginger flower fried rice. Breakfast was okay, but some cooking spots were messy, with flies around.

Service was excellent ‚Äîfrom check-in to check-out, everything went smoothly. The staff was friendly and helpful.

If you're cool with bugs and love nature, this place is alright. But if you need a wheelchair, it might be tricky with stairs and slopes.","We spent some days in this hotel and it was amazing. The views, the atmosphere, the staff and everything. However,I would recommend installing AC in each bedroom,since it gets really cold at night and the heater they provide, doesn‚Äôt really warm the bedroom.
This was the only thing we didn‚Äôt like.","stay here, the kids like it. cool air with good views.
the room is okay, just don't cook anything in the room. So for those with children, you can alternatively bring lots of snacks or order food at the restaurant.

the staff is friendly, the food is ok...

there is a warm water swimming pool and floats for children so that children feel comfortable swimming after breakfast.

I will come back another time when I have a holiday. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

We were super impressed, had a wonderful time. The room/bed was very comfortable. In addition to adventuring to waterfalls and beautiful viewpoints close in proximity (and of course right there on the property the views were epic), relaxing on the netting and reading a book in the morning was amazing. Also wonderful home cooked cuisine by the friendly staff! My photos really don‚Äôt do it justice so suggest you see for yourself!","Absolutely amazing place! Takes a bit of work to get there (we went by bike), but definitely worth it. The view is amazing, the rooms are perfect (not as basic as you might expect from a ‚Äòglamping‚Äô), the staff very friendly. The restaurant has the basic dishes and you might want to bring some snacks and drinks, we bought some en route. The trip down is very steep, so be careful.

My now-fianc√© proposed to me during sunset, it felt like we had the whole view just for us. We will remember this place forever, it was very special to us ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you so much!","Loveeeed this place and the staff ü•∞ would highly recommend (actually writing this while sending it to my friends cause they also wanna go now üòÉ) and i remembered I wanted to write a review here ü§ó The food was also good. Come here before sunset and have dinner + amazing night of sleep, breakfast was also lovely. Food was simple but definitely good! But especially the two man working here were so kind ü•∞","Absolutely Amazing! Incredible view and located in a calm and beautiful area, good for hiking. Very comfy and clean huts and friendly staff. There are a lot of waterfalls in that area. For adrenaline junkies I can recommend a Canyoning tour with the guys from canyoningbali.id or for a more chill half day trip a guided tour at lake Tamblingan with Amerta Jati Trekking Point. We learned a lot about Bali religion and nature.","The view is amazing, the location is near a waterfall that you can visit and enjoy.
They have also a restaurant with good delicious food and Pirga and Dian provided great help when needed
Thank you Pirga and Dian for the great hospitality, will definitely come back"

One of the best restaurants during my Bali adventure. I recommend it 10/10! The service and staff are also 10/10. A big plus is beautiful views!,"Delicious food, good service, stunning view.

We splurged and got the steak tenderloin, which they cooked perfectly, the Nasi something, pork belly bowl, mushroom soup, and each had 2 lattes. Everything was great. The lattes were a little too sweet for my taste, so maybe if you're like me ask for less sugar.","Had breakfast, lunch and dinner. I recommend it. Only bad thing is that some portions were small. Good coffee too","What a beautiful and amazing restaurant! The hospitality was outstanding! Peni was so wonderful from start to finish‚Äîit was raining when we arrived, and she came out to greet us with umbrellas. She was kind, attentive and served us a delicious meal with outstanding lattes! We had the nachos, ribs and a chicken rice bowl! Peni was just so amazing and friendly, somebody please give this lady a raise for going above and beyond! We highly recommend!","Delicious food, great service, a hidden gem! The staff was so friendly to show us their amazing villa's! My family and I are very grateful for the hospitality."
