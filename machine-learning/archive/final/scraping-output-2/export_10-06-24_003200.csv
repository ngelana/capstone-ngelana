It’s way off the beaten path but if you are into that, go visit. It’s definitely an adventure. The ancient temple does not appear at fist glance. You need to cross the creek, about 4 feet deep when I crossed. Follow the path and turn right at the first availability.

I counted 292 stairs on the way back up. I loved them so much I did them twice ;).","Unless you go to swimming there is not much to do, it is very interesting to see that old carved temple in the other side of the river that's it. You take the picture and you are ready to leave. Maybe if you have a lot of time in the island go and explore everything, it is nice to see all the nature.But if  you don't have enough time you  can skip this one.",a historical heritage place among the local residents. the story behind this place is amazing. once upon a time Ken Arok was here for meditation and create the sculpture with his nails. such a peaceful place. i guess this place was a forest long time ago. local people take the clean water from the upstream,Walking down 300 steps (counted) reveals... Not too much. The ancient temple carved in the rock bed is overgrown with plants - at the other side of the river. Beautiful nature at the confluence of the two rivers though.,Ok
