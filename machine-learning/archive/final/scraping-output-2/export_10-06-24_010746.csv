Loved my stay at Bukit Taman, the staff were unbelievably kind and took great care of us. Rooms were lovely and clean and the swimming pool has an amazing view. I would definitely come back here. Was very sad to leave!","We really enjoyed our time in Bukit Taman Cottages. Our bungalow was stunning, comfortable bed and built well. Nice views from the bed. The pool was truly amazing and the staff incredible. The stairs felt like a work out, but luckily the staff carried our luggages both ways. Because of the remote location, it's best to have a moped. Thank you!","Wow. What a hidden gem. The views are incredible. Access to town is easy - most restaurants offer free pick up/drop off so you can get a lift down for a meal from one place and a ride back from a different place later, spending time at the beach or exploring shops or doing a yoga class in between! Room was cleaned to perfection each day. Katut, Tony & their team looked out for us and helped us plan a wonderful time on the island every day. Easiest if you only take what you need & leave your suitcase behind if you can. Eco minded community - they offer free water refills everywhere. We stayed 4 nights and wished we could‚Äôve stayed longer. A magical island.","My partner and I stayed here for our 1 year wedding anniversary and it was perfect! The small team of staff are super lovely, kind and helpful. The facilities were also really nice, clean, and they supplied everything we needed. It was a little further out from everything which meant it was peaceful and had beautiful views on top of the mountain, but was only a short scooter ride (10-15 mins) to get to meals, shopping or the beach from any direction. We want to come back and wished we stayed here longer!","This accommodation is absolutely perfect. As it is on the hill, you have a spectacular view facing mt Ahnung. The pool is big and clean and you can relax all day here if you like without getting bored. You have your own bungalow which is also very cute and clean. The owner as well as the staff are so friendly and helped with all our questions and dinner reservations. We were a group of four without scooter, but this was no problem as  many restaurants and tours offer pick up and drop off service. I warmly recommend to stay here if you want to enjoy some unique view and relax a few days on nusa lembongan."

This was the first time after hundreds of bookings that a much higher price was supposed to be paid later, which is a no-go and a rip-off.","This place is great. The view is something else. Absolutely beautiful, day and night.  super friendly and helpful staff. They have mopeds available to rent for 100,000/day. The room was very nice, well kept and cleaned every day. We loved this place so much, we extended our stay an additional 2 nights. We will definitely be coming back next summer vacation. I highly recommend it.","Should have been a nice place but unfortunately had a bad experience. No water in the room, cups but no kettle, tea or coffee (why provide cups then?). By the time I noticed it was past 8pm and all the staff had gone home so I was stranded and thirsty -  whatsapp was not responsive and refused to answer calls - just sent sporadic texts. Had no wifi (looks like there were three networks but the one that reached my room was down - and because staff had gone home no one to fix it so couldn't get my work done). Also no one here to provide a scooter so stranded. Basically all things that would be easily fixed by having someone on site left this to be a pretty miserable evening. Eventually found their fridge and ""stole"" some water in the dark. Pool was closed early so I couldn't even have a late night swim... It's a pretty place but given it's in a more remote location needs staff available. Not sure what you would do in an emergency here... Avoid.","I had to check to another hotel at 2 am.

The outdoor light was so strong, I could not sleep. In some other room the outdoor light is so bright in the rooms.
I ask to the staff about the problem. they refused to help. They said ""first"" to turn off the light of the veranda. The staff consider us stupid. They refused to refund us. We did nothing the next day almost because of tiredness.","Amazing stay with these friendly locals. Room was very clean, bed was comfortable and the staff gave me lifts to places you couldn't walk to. Great place to stay but consider hiring a motorbike. I prefer to walk and found getting around the island walking is very tricky as everyone is driving and there is no foot path. Fortunately the staff always offered to help with driving to great yoga studios such as Yoga Bliss and Yoga Dunia. If you want to chill by the pool then you probably could just spend all your time here and avoid going into townüôÇ"

The staff are friendly, the owner Kadek was very helpful in advising on and arranging activities such as surf board hire or snorkelling trips.

All round a great spot and would always come back.","We had a delicious lunch, with dishes recommended by the owner and cooked fresh. Located a little outside the main town area it was well worth the short drive.","Sampling the local cuisine is a must-do for everyone. The flavors are truly exceptional, appealing to both Asian and Western palates. Don't miss out on classics like Chicken Satay and fried fish!","Nice cozy place with authentic food and kind owners. Food was freshly prepared and delicious. The prices were very fair and no additional tax etc. was added.
There is a beautiful garden, would be great if there would be also tables to sit at."

Lembongan island is so beautiful, amazing cliffs and beaches, they have supermarkets and cafes around too. Thanks for having us, we felt like home and will definitely come back again ü´∂üèº","Stayed at Maharatu for a few nights, it has cozy and chill vibes. There‚Äôs a friendly husky type dog called Snowy that welcomes you and is really sweet, it made the stay feel like home! Bungalow was comfy, staff were helpful. Overall a good spot for a chill getaway.",Really really peaceful place which is close by to pretty much everything. Mushroom bay and the yellow bridge is easily accessible and the pool is super clean. Definite value for money!

Stayed here for many nights and really loved the place. Great, interesting and kind owner. Pool is lovely and clean, rooms are spacious, well maintained, nicely designed and very clean. Staff is super nice, and they will try to do everything to make you smile.

The staff were INCREDIBLE, the villa was one of the most beautiful I have ever seen, let alone stayed, & our family loved it so much!","I believe 353 is the most beautiful place to stay in the Island. The view is terrific, and the vila is a refugee for a peaceful time if you need to turn off from a busy routine. Take it as a retreat! The owner has extremely good taste for arts and decoration. The garden and pool are very well maintained by staff who are very good on making you feel home. I wish we can be back soon :)","The moment you walk through the door at 353 Degrees North the stunning views will capture you. After you take a breathe you will be delighted in the incredible design and set out of this Villa. What really makes it, is the wonderful staff that make you feel welcome and relaxed. This has to be one of the most spectacular Villas I have ever stayed in. Well worth a visit, highly recommend. Thanks Team & Jodie for making our stay so incredibly memorable.","353 Degrees North Villa was the highlight of our Bali trip. Amazing views, sunsets, sunrise, as well as being close to the beach for a really good surf. The staff are incredible and can organise snorkelling trips, scooters, or anything else that you may need in no time! Absolutely incredible! The villa itself is nothing but the best, huge rooms with amazing bathrooms and beautiful furniture. Many places to sit and chill as well as the grass area just below the pool with hanging seats (from a tree) and a bed to relax on. The roof top is something special too for stargazing and sunset moments.",One of the most outstanding and beautiful places I've had the pleasure of staying at. My wife and I went for our honeymoon and feel so blessed to have found this villa and to have stayed there for such a special trip. The view is breathtaking and the villa is outstanding. The staff are incredibly friendly and cooked my fiance and I a delicious dinner on the rooftop as we ate in front of a gorgeous view of the island. Can not wait to come back.

The owner is very warm and friendly. She makes you feel at home and let's you feel as a part of family. I highly recommend this place. It's  in middle of everything. I suggest renting your own scooter so you can enjoy this amazing place.,"We stayed here for three nights and were very happy about this decision.
The room was great and clean. Every room has a terrace with a lot of space.
But the best of our stay there was the really kind and helpful family who did everything to make our stay as nice as possible.
We would always come back there, cause it was one of the best homestays of our jouney. We really made new friends there and wish them all the best! We clearly  recommend to stay there!",The family hosting the guesthouse made us feel at home. We were so happy with the service and the room was huge very spacious and beautiful! We recommend this guesthouse!,"Very deceived of the place. The personnel is friendly but a lot of dogs, no possibilities to come in bike... And far from and to everything. Also, the breakfast is light and doesn't break anything. They try to do something good and they'll succeed. But the access will stay hard.","Good location even if is better to arrive during the day the 1st time. Nice room, bathroom ok (no hot water like almost all indonesia). Nice garden and owners are very kind!! Very good for the price and everything."
