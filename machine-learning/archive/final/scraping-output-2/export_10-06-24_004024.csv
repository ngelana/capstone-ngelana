The path there is very tricky, ask the locals to help you and they will guide you there and are good for motivation, they don't expect anything for guiding you. Wear sturdy footwear though as parts can be slippery especially if there's been recent rainfall.","Challenging hike with no signage but so worth it. Friendly locals helped us to find the way, without them we wouldâ€™ve been lost. Incredible views, surreal experience to be ontop of the waterfall. Can feel itâ€™s a very special place.",A very complicated hike I would nearly say climb. I would highly recommend to get these ladies down there as a guide for 100k. Me and my girlfriend there doing it alone and at some point it was complicated to find the right way. But after the 30-45 minutes hike u find a unbelievable beautiful view. You should be completely alone up there!,"Beautiful place. hard to find and hard to get to. thanks to that, no one is here and it's worth it. Perfect day ðŸ™‚","Very beautiful landscape and stunning view. One of the most wild by civilization place that can be reached.
You have to climb up the hill through the jungle by the almost invisible path. Local gay helped us and guided to the waterfall. Without him we havenâ€™t found the waterfall.
It took at least 40 min climbing.  Path was slippery as it rained in previous night."
