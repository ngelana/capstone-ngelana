The hotel was clean the staff  friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast was ok have had much better at other hotels in the area. Room was spacious bed very comfortable. A small problem with bath towels they were old looking not soft and fluffy as you'd expect.
Beach towels were very hard to find and again worn and stained. Not enough  sun lounges around pool area. Shuttle service to and from Bali collection very convenient. Overall a nice place in a convenient location!!!",Our stay at the hotel was perfect. The people working there are very helpful! I got sick and they immediately provided a car to drive me to the hospital. Everyone is really good and caring. I am very happy to have stayed here! I totally recommend it!,"We originally booked a deluxe room but had some noise issues from the room next door so we upgraded to the Premier Suite. The room was large, modern, clean and most importantly very quiet. Breakfast was excellent, location was great,  not too far from the beach. The hotel also provides free bicycles which we used. The pool was small but we enjoyed the beautiful surroundings.
Very few pool staff to assist with drink or food orders. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Bali Nusa Dua Hotel but would not recommend the deluxe room. The walls are like cardboard and a noisy neighbor will ruin your holiday.",Great rooms. Good value for money. Breakfast was okay. Pool is smaller than it looks in pictures with a shortage of seating. Plan to eat/drink somewhere else. Coffee was 79k and cocktail 285k++!! that's the most expensive of anywhere in Bali 😳,This place was great. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable. Location was good. Breakfast was really good. Would be nice to have a stronger shower pressure but that’s about it.

The only thing missing was onsite spa services so I ordered a massage from Lux La Vie Therapy in a local Facebook Community group. What a great and convenient experience, the therapist showed up on time after making my reservation. I chose a traditional Balinese massage, it was amazing, extremely relaxing and soothing so I fell asleep almost instantly. I will definitely order again but maybe try a different style massage they offer like Ayurvedic or Reflexology. Dias the therapist was cheerful and professional and surprisingly strong which was just what I needed.","Friendly staffs & thanks to Mba Oliep for taking care for our reservations since the beginning. The rooms was actually nice however the sheets is kinda dirty, and the shower didn’t function properly.",Perfect for the price. Very kind and friendly staff.

From the moment you step inside, the vibrant, colorful decor transports you to the bustling streets of India.

The menu is expansive, offering a tantalizing array of vegetarian and non vegetarian
dishes that burst with flavor. The dosas are simply divine, with a perfect crispy exterior and fluffy interior. And the curries - oh, the curries! Each one is a masterful blend of aromatic spices that will tantalize your taste buds.

What really sets Udupi Bali apart is the attention to detail and the passion of the staff. They are incredibly knowledgeable about the cuisine and go out of their way to ensure every guest leaves fully satisfied.

If you're craving an authentic taste of South India, look no further than Udupi Bali. It's a culinary journey you won't soon forget.","Compared to the lowest reviews everything went smoothly. The check in was fast, 5 min tops. Got a very nice welcome drink and they helped us bringing us and the heavy suitcases to the room.
Only the bed was for us to hard for sleeping. But for others it's good so it's not a real negative point. Maybe have a few rooms with softer beds for people that want a softer bed would be nice. The self in the bathroom room broke accidentally but no problem. They even offered us to change to a other room but for us it was no problem so we didn't.  Service was excellent 👌.
Service in the restaurant was great. We had breakfast included. Maritu was so nice and funny. Also recommended us Masala Dosai what was enak parah and also the Indian filter coffee.
Gonna miss the morning with him. Thank you so much for the nice time!!","UDUPI-BALI
I recently visited this restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised with the decor and ambiance of the restaurant.
The restaurant had a delightful and relaxing vibe which made me feel too comfortable.
They have a separate dine-in for vegetarians and mixed with veg and non-veg dine-in.
Both Indian and Indonesian cuisines are served at the restaurants.
The food tasted good and the pricing was affordable.
The restrooms were very clean and tidy.
Service was at the best all the staff over there were super friendly and greeted us in a great manner.
The restaurant has ample parking space.
A must-try Indian and Indonesian cuisine in Bali.","Delicious fish Rawa fry, paper masala dosa, chicken sukkah.

If tax and vat will be added in a individual dishes. That will be wonderful.,"If your driver recommends this place to you, please avoid it at all cost.

The place seems pretty empty and only tourists there are those brought by their drivers. The driver was hard selling this place but it was a complete let down. Should have looked at the google reviews first (it had a good rating but many reviews look like fake accounts)
We ordered crispy duck rice and ayam goreng. The duck was cold and red inside. We feedback to the unwilling staff and they did not admit that it was their kitchen’s fault and just asked if we want the duck to be cooked longer. The chicken rice was below average and definitely not worth paying for IDR140,000 each. We ordered a large Bintang beer and the total cost was almost IDR 400,000. There is service charge of 8% and tax 10%. The service and food does not tally with the cost charged.

An absolute scam!!

The place had two dining areas, one outdoor and one air conditioned but the air conditioned area was infested with flies. The moment someone opened the sliding door, a housefly flew in and went into our beer. Which was really gross and we couldn’t drink it. It was a new cup of beer.

Terrible experience here and please just not visit this place.","Tourist? Eat else where honestly..

Not a great place. Pricing seemed like a higher mid tier restaurant but it's not worth the price. Our driver for the day recommended it and apparently so did many other drivers as a few of them hang out in this little shack outside while mostly tourists dine inside.

It really wasn't anything to write home about. While the presentation looks nice, the atmosphere is pretty dead. Music so low you can't even hear it, staff aren't very enthusiastic, we were seated and waited quite a while for menus, and there's barely any communication (no one asking if everything is good, no one asking if anything else).

The food was kinda bland. While the duck was nice and crispy, it really didn't have much flavor. Honestly the best thing we had was probably the smoothie.

Overall, this seems more of a tourist place that drivers recommend. Wonder if there is some sort of referral bonus?",Our driver recommended us this place. It was empty when we arrived. It’s mostly for tourists who brought over by drivers. The food is just so so and price on a mid high range.,You can try western food here which is delicious.  But here has the service charge and not including the tax of the government which will be 18% more from your original bill.

The staff is friendly and attentive, and the menu is extensive, with options to suit every taste and preference. We had a wonderful experience at Rehat Cafe and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy and inviting cafe to enjoy a quick coffee break or a casual meal.","Wow- this cafe is a little gem in the midst of Balis local shops & warungs. I came here on a weekdays early afternoon, after organizing a SIM card close by (there are multiple options, if that’s something you need.)

On arrival I was welcomed warmly. The atmosphere is peaceful, cool (not “too” cold like other places, but rather very comforting) and small but spacious at the same time.
There is fast Wifi available.

The menu looks great and the prices are absolutely fair. One of the least overpriced cafes I’ve ever been to on Bali- thumbs up!

The food arrived quickly, portions are on the medium/ smaller side- which is exactly what I was looking for. The taste: great, everything feels fresh & nourishing.

All in all- one of my new favorite spots, I will be back!","Thanks for the weird reply, Rehat founder. So, can I ask - are you actually going to give basic human rights to your chef, and up the air con for your customers, or do you prefer just to write silly replies and continue the human rights abuses?

Original review:
Poor chef stuck in a tiny kitchen in the relentless heat no air con windows open, it’s really a form of commercial torture. It’s 32 degrees. I feel so bad for the poor guy.

Owner, you need to care for your staff. I’m upset you let your chef suffer in a tiny hot space all day. Where is your sense of humanity?

They are out of the overnight oats, then if I want to get avocado on toast I can’t I need to order one of their unhealthy pre-determined breakfast options, why do these cafes make life so complicated?

Oh yeh and maybe turn up the air con for your poor customers suffering in your light house. You should change this cafe to an indoor plant house, the conditions are good for growing plants but not for humans.","Tasty breakfast for a good price. The portion was just perfect for me. Great coffee. I guess it's comfortable to work here because of many sockets and good wi-fi. The toilet was a bit dirty, but no big deal
Added a few street view photos to help you find the right turn","Really good place for breakfast. Very good coffee. Portion sizes are small , but worth for the price. Probably order 2x portions for a big breakfast😊. On the flip side don’t expect much customer service"

The service was brilliant (thanks Eva:) and really made this an amazing experience. Nusa Dua needs more restaurants like this! It is more reasonably priced than most resorts too.","Food was decently portioned, drinks priced alright. Ambience was quite romantic and felt exclusive as you needed to go through a special route to reach there. Taking 1 star off as the food took some time to reach and the bill took quite a bit of time as well. Otherwise the service was fine!","This restaurant is really great. It feels open and comfortable. Everyone working here is very nice—they smile, show respect, and take good care of you. The food tastes good too.

The soup with ribs is something you should try—it's amazing. The crispy duck is also very yummy, with special spicy flavoring.

I want to say thanks to Nosi, who took care of us so well. She was always there to help, checking if we liked our food, and giving us good advice on what to eat. She made us feel at home. Great work, Nosi!","Housed within a cluster of private villas, this restaurant has very nice ambience.
Our waitress recommended the Bebek Goreng (fried duck), BBQ Balinese Pork Rib, and Abem Abemiga (pork rib) soup. Our favorite was the fried duck as it was fried to the right level. The pork rib was also good and the portion was generous.
We also ordered the Sate Campur (skewered meat) and that was good too.
We completed our meal with a nicely done Pisang Goreng (fried banana) with vanilla ice cream.
Kudos to the restaurant for an excellent dining experience, especially to our hostess Eva for outstanding service.","Breakfast was a pleasure every morning.

On entering this place we were met with distrust and lack of warmth. In our 4 trips to Bali this was a first. Next we tried to pay on arrival but their machine had issues with a our credit cards (cc) so they forcibly suggested we pay in cash.  Note that our cc had successfully been used three times elsewhere that day. After a reboot the machine processed the payment. Still smiling and being polite I had hoped that I could dispel the coldness, to no avail.
Such a pity as when we saw the grounds and room we said that we would love to come back here on our next trip.
It's no wonder the place is empty, see attached photo. This place could be a hidden gem if the issues above were addressed","This hotel is in a good location within walking distance to cafes and restaurant. A little further to the beach. We booked the deluxe room with pool views after reading other reviews and we were glad we did as they were nicer than the older rooms which the hotel showed us also. The cleaning staff and lady that showed us to our room were really helpful and friendly. The pool is big and really nice and the room was a nice size.

Disliked · The greeting we got at reception was far from welcoming. We had negotiated a price online with the hotel and they tried to say we were in contact with another property despite the pictures being the exact same as the place we were in. We booked a room with breakfast but we couldn't get the breakfast because they only serve from 7 and we needed to leave at 7. Initially they said we could have toast and fruit at 6.30am but then changed their minds. The fridge in our room was moldy but when they couldn't get the mold off by cleaning they replaced it with another one. The tap in the bathroom was also broken.","Good price vs quality balance. Room cleaning every day, 2 bottles of water, basic breakfast. 10min by foot from the beach. There are two buildings: old and new. Old one is way cheaper, so the furniture and the finishing of the rooms is older. New building is more expensive and there are nicer rooms directly in front of the ~25m pool. Staff is super friendly and nice.","This hotel is beautiful and cosy, hence has a good parking area, a beautiful pool and garden. My issue is cleaning, it seems it is not a priority to clean, so bathrooms, tables, and even windows are dirty. I know I booked a 2 star hotel but cleaning should be still essential. I booked 2 superior rooms for their price but when I inspected the toilets couldn't believe their conditions. I had to said that it was too dirty and that I preferred deluxe rooms. We were moved to better rooms with pool view for extra $14 night which was fine. However, even these rooms weren't spotless, again their bathrooms have mould, hence their bins haven't been clean for ages. Overall, the hotel needs to invest more on cleaning. Customer service was always good and tried to accommodate to our requests.","This accommodation has 2 sections, one is extremely old and outdated and the second is new and looks very nice. Literally like 2 different hotels. Unfortunately I stayed in the old building which needs some serious work. The shower was ridiculous, it was fitted directly straight, not angled and it only sprayed your face really aggressively. Meaning you had to take the shower off and spray your body or you can’t clean. Great shower for ear washes. The breakfast was oily and bread tasted like it had been microwaved. The pool was actually a really good size but needs a clean. I wouldn’t recommend here."
