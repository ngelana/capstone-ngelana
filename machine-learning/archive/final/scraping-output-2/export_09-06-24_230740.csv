Very hostile and helpful hostess! Great location! Very nice clean and cosy rooms! Had a great time staying at this place! Amazing view from the outside to the volcano and jungles! Everyone speaks perfect English and so helpful to fulfil all the guestsâ€™ needs! Recommend this place to everyone! If you get a chance try the most delicious handmade pies!,"I biked from Ubud to this remote location with the most stunning view to Agung Volcano. The hosts offer fantastic food and home-made ginger beer and many ideas for visiting sights by foot close-by, such as waterfalls and peaks.","Excellent views of Batur and Agung! I saw such a gorgeous sunrise and ate an incredible breakfast with homemade bread, eggs the way I like them, home smoked bacon, and beans. The hosts John and Utami are so friendly and welcoming. The rooms are huge and my king size bed was comfortable. Please stay here in this quiet village of Auman!","What a fantastic place. Lovely views from the garden terrace of Mount Agung and Mount Batur. Rooms are exceptional and are the most spacious that I've stayed in while in Bali with a lovely big balcony to enjoy the views. Hosts are absolutely wonderful people, very warm and friendly with lots of very interesting stories to share. Nothing is any trouble and have lots of great insight into things to do and enjoy for your stay in Bali. All in all 5 star and highly recommended.","Loved this place. Really nice host, great food and a lovely area. All vegetables are grown in their garden. Rooms are sweet and has a nice view. Definitely worth a visit!"
