Also we wanted to run away from crowdy beaches and noisy cities üôè this location was perfect also because grab/gojek is working normally, charging local prices (not in Ubud area where prices are doubled) and Airport is really close (200-300K IDR). If we would have more time, we would spend there another day üòä host rented us a scooter and we visited Goa Waterfall (beautiful), Penglipuran Village (beautiful) and beautiful exclusive temple. Also host gave us all sarung dressing and invited us visiting his family, later - local Temple, guided us though the ceremony and help with whatever we asked. The food is good quality, breakfast coffee good, clean rooms, good smell. Also there was coffee and water in the room.","We had a great time at Kubu Bakas Guest House. The house was so nice, you can enjoy the nature. The bungalows were really charming, made of natural materials. Here you can discover the real Bali, away from the noisy Ubud. The owner Ari is a very nice guy. I highly recommend it! The food was also delicious.
Amazing place with the friendly people! üòä","Definitely a restaurant that produces surprises.

A small restaurant, located among the fields of Ubud area. Menu is of limited choice, but every dish we got were astonishingly good. Grilled fish, Balinese suckling pig, Balinese grilled chicken, also the drinks, fresh juices and milkshakes. The quality is comparable to any restaurant you could get in the city area, with a very affordable pricing.

Staffs are also very nice and helpful. Surely worth a try if you are somewhere near.","We recently had the pleasure of staying at Kubu Bakas, a remarkable homestay hosted by an amazing couple, Ari and his wife, along with their adorable children and energetic dogs. We cannot emphasize enough how sad we are to leave this place, as it offered a truly harmonious and peaceful experience. From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed into their family, and we felt like a part of it throughout our entire stay.

One of the highlights of our visit was being invited by Ari to join a ceremony at their local temple. It was an incredible opportunity to witness and participate in their traditions, and it left a lasting impression on us. Additionally, Ari went above and beyond to make our stay memorable by organizing nightly bonfires where we could gather and share stories. These intimate moments brought us closer together and created lasting memories.

The bungalows at Kubu Bakas were truly delightful. Built with natural materials, they exuded a rustic charm while still offering modern comforts. We found everything we needed in the bungalows, and the beds were exceptionally comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep. The surroundings were serene and tranquil, contributing to our overall relaxation. After a day filled with activities, we always looked forward to returning to this haven of peace.

When we initially booked our stay, we believed there would be no Wi-Fi available. However, to our pleasant surprise, there was reliable Wi-Fi in the rooms. This unexpected amenity allowed us to stay connected and share our incredible experiences with friends and family.

Having traveled throughout Asia for over half a year, we can confidently say that Kubu Bakas is an exceptional and one-of-a-kind homestay experience. Ari, his wife, and their entire family created an environment that was not only comfortable and inviting but also made us feel like cherished guests. The genuine warmth and hospitality they extended to us were truly heartwarming.

Leaving Kubu Bakas was undoubtedly bittersweet, as we grew to love the place and the people who made it so special. We know that we will miss the peaceful atmosphere, the lovingly energetic dogs, and, most of all, the sense of being part of Ari's wonderful family. We wholeheartedly recommend Kubu Bakas to anyone seeking a unique and unforgettable stay. We, for one, are already looking forward to our next visit, where we can once again find solace and relaxation in this remarkable homestay.","An amazing moment with the most amazing and beautiful people. Magnificent place and delicious food. Thank you so much Ary and his family for what you do, for making us feel at home in the other side of the world. Loved every second. Take care."

He welcomed us with a big smile at the airport, it was easy to find him and his car was really clean so it gives you a taste of what to expect when arriving at the accommodation.
I loved the welcome drink upon arrival and the area is really peaceful, we felt very relaxed.

The bungalow is clean and has everything you need; good WiFi, Aircon, bottles of clean water, a balcony to enjoy the view and the calmness of nature. We saw a cute bird making a nest which was really cute.

The food was delicious and the kitchen staff is really nice.

We stayed only for 1 night so we wanted to visit a waterfall near by, and Ari helped us to get there and we had a great time.
If you need to have a wonder around, you can rent a scooter as well.

I can highly recommend Kubu Bakas!

Great accommodation and a great team!

Merci beaucoup üòä","A true oasis just outside the chaos of Ubud, the place is literally in the middle of the rice fields surrounded by nature. The owners are really amazing people (and the cats are adorable).
If you're looking for a quiet experience in the nature, this is the place and the stars at night make an amazing view.","Incredible location, amazing view of ricefieds and sea at the back, it's so peaceful we will be back for sure!
