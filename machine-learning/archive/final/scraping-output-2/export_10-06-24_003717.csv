Gianyar, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80515, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=9501846867702447283,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.2,22,,"It is a nice waterfall, but it‚Äôs not impressive like some other ones close by. If you are searching for a place with no people, I could recommend this one. I was totally alone here and even some locals didn‚Äôt knew where this waterfall was. The taxi driver had a hard time finding it too. It was really calm, but sadly there is quite some trash.","Not into touristic sites? This is a must-do. After a pretty tough hike (but if you‚Äôre lucky, a local will help you get there) you‚Äôll reach an incredibly beautiful set of waterfalls, and a fresh pool to cool down. In the midst of the jungle, you‚Äôll be here all alone in peace and harmony. Lovely experience.","one of the waterfalls in the Gianyar area that you must visit, because the natural surroundings are still natural and the surrounding air is very fresh with clear water from natural mountain springs.  good for swimming and relaxing, because the place is still virgin. If you want to unwind and relieve stress, I highly recommend that you visit this waterfall.",To difficult dangerous path to get to waterfall,"Good place and hidden, reccomended for you if you like trekking"

If it was clean it would be beautiful.

This one is the correct location.  To get there follow the path straight. Down then up then down again. Do not turn off. Most of the path has tires for stairs",,,,
