ChIJu76MHXM90i0Rv3H2cY2INGw,Villa Semana Resort & Spa Ubud,-8.523850699999999,115.23390799999999,"Banjar Semana, Singakerta, Ubud, Gianyar Regency, Bali 80571, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=7797006995968913855,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 8987111,resort_hotel,"resort_hotel, hotel, lodging",4.5,168,,"This is one of the best places I ever stayed in. The whole area is astonishingly beautiful surrounded by jungle next to a river. The service is above and beyond. Also the food is amazing and the restaurant has an amazing view. The massages were also asking the best ones I ever had. And all that for a very good price, especially for European standards. I cannot recommend this place more.

Just remember that this place is surrounded by nature, which is a big part of the charm of this place. Thus, you'll encounter animals like frogs or lizards. They can sometimes also enter your room. But they seemed harmless. And tue staff is very happy to assist on removing an animal if necessary.","We stayed at Villa Semana for our honeymoon and had the most amazing experience. We booked the honeymoon package which included a 2 hour massage and bath next to the river and waterfall, a romantic dinner next to the jungle (see attached photos). The food served was excellent, I think we were provided with a whole duck!
The staff we so attentive to our needs, helping us organise activities and travel requirements.
We can’t thank (and rate) Villa Semana enough for our honeymoon, as they made sure it was a truely special experience","Book this hotel for your Bali trip! You will love it! Villa Semana is like a paradise on earth. The hotel feels very exclusive between some rice fields, a river and the jungle with direct jungle and river views from the restaurant and the pool. The people that work there are amazing and make sure you have everything to feel comfortable.

They make your bed while you are having breakfast and make everything ready in the night for the night in the afternoon (mosquito net etc). The spa feels like it's from another planet and the prices are really good. I can highly recommend the Eden Couple massage with the flower bath but really any massage is great there with the peaceful sound of water and direct jungle views.

The food is prepared freshly for you and you can make any adjustments you want. They also make sure that any ice in the drinks is made from drinking water (which is not a standard everywhere in Bali - be careful). If you book with breakfast you also have afternoon tea / coffee with a dessert included from 4-5PM which I can recommend.

It's located in the outskirts of Ubud, the cultural center of Bali. Ubud city is very crowded, loud and not very relaxing but it's great for shopping and to see traditional dances but it was always so nice to come back to the Villa Semana in the peaceful and quiet rice fields and jungles where you hear the frogs and all animals during the night and not the cars. They have free shuttles to Ubud city centre several times a day, however, if you need a shuttle outside of these times, you can always get it for some small fee (4-5€). Ubud city centre is a 15-25 Min drive away, depending on the traffic.

Because of its location, some small insects and animals (e.g. small frogs) might get to your room if you open the windows at night. If you don't feel comfortable bringing them back outside yourself, you can always call the reception and ask for help. But again, they come to your room at least twice a day and might have done this already for you actually. Everyone there is very kind and happy to help you with anything you need.

Definitely book Villa Semana on your Bali trip! It's great for couples and also families or friends since the bathroom door can be fully closed.",I stayed at Cove Semana where I got a cozy room with bathtub also 😊 plus a great view,Beautiful villa with private pools that overlooks the river and padi fields. Service was also very attentive and friendly. Massage at the spa also highly recommended with great views. Many thanks to the staff and especially Ms. Dewi who went out of her way to make this a very memorable stay. She even surprised us with a cake on our birthday!

Clean and nice rooms.
Kevin is the owner, kind and helpful as the young lady working there.
The common area and the garden are beautiful.
Breakfast was delicious. There is a variety of choices for the breakfast.
You can refill your water bottle in the common kitchen. There is a fridge too in the kitchen.
It is possible to rent a motorbike.
It is 10 minutes on a motorbike from the Ubud centre.","Most amazing stay in one month of traveling in Asia. Most clean, most friendly hospitality, most serene and beautiful environment. Greatest cooked breakfast served upon request of many choices. Kevin and the family is great and we are glad we found out about this place. 4 km from city center of Ubud so you need a motorcycle or car(?) But is worth it as it very quiet and peaceful. They even took care of our laundry very kindly! Value for money 💯💯💯 Keep up the good job Kevin thank you!! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽","We stayed for 5 days during the Nyepi celebration week. We loved this place. The food offered here is excellent, and the host Kevin is an awesome and nice person. The one downside is that the hotel is tucked a 10 min bike drive from Ubud Centre, so if you’re going to be out and about the city often, be ready to hire transport to bring your own bike. Other than that I would stay here the next time I visit Bali.","The place felt very calm, welcoming and quiet.
You are staying in a balinese neighbourhood,which makes it very special.

The rooms are well sized, well kept and clean 👌👌

Their breakfast is included and it is very nicely cooked every morning.

It is a 10 mins drive from the centre so you need to be happy driving a motorbike or relying on Taxis.

The family you would stay with are very friendly and professional about hospitality.

Very good value for money. I'd stay again.","Nice clean and serene place 20 minutes out of Ubud. So you need a scooter. Newly built rooms with nice grounds and a friendly family feel. Host was very helpful. Rooms are a little damp here, but shower and bath were great."

We had :

- ayam bakar = delicious! no complaints from us
- crispy duck = we tried some crispy duck in Bali and all has no taste, not even salty. Well, meat was tender, and best urap!

From all good foods we tried, we disappointed with the sink. Sink was dirty, even there’s a comb with hairs. Hope they clean it up soon.","Silent and calm place with tasty food. Nice menu, a lot of sitting places, amazing spacious view at the rice fields 🫶🏼
so enjoyed — recommend Mango Juice, Chicken strips, Nasi Goreng.",Best place with rice terrace view in ubud and the Best of food (excellent r),"Beautiful quiet serene and a hidden gem.

Hidden gem.","This place exceeded our expectations in every single aspect. From the moment we entered the property, we felt extremely welcomed. I wanted to give 6 stars to the hospitality and service. The whole team is amazing and fulfilled all our wishes. The food in the restaurant is delicious and the afternoon tea (and complementary snacks in the room) are super tasty! The room is beautiful, very spacious and impeccably prepared. The massage with the sound of the river in the background was deeply relaxing. And the exclusive infinity pool is just WOW!! Definitely a paradise for a perfect relaxing time in Ubud.","Permata Ayung is one of the most beautiful places my husband and I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so welcomed and special by the staff there (who are just like family by the way)

Mr De Vries has achieved the spectacularly rare task of accomplishing complete blissful, tranquil privacy with thoughtful architectural touches in each and every single guest room, with no two rooms looking the same.

We stayed on the ground floor of the Kudus Suite, it was just magical. From the terrace overlooking rolling rice fields, to the hand carved stone free standing bath tub - we were in complete awe of it all. Thank you so much for allowing us to share this experience. We will remember it forever - and we will definitely be back!","One of the most beautiful places I've ever been to. The nature is outstanding, a real treat to the mind, body and soul"
