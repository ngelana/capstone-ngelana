It's not a long walk to the Waterfall and wading pools. Nothing like a cool plunge during a warm day.
There are three steep flights of steps, but all have railings to hold onto, then a short flat walk over seven sturdy footbridges, then you'll be at a picturesque sight.
On your way down, there are clean toilets. There was a small stall at the car park selling drinks and snacks.
A restaurant further down on your way to the Waterfall entrance.
Maybe another one soon, as there was some nice looking construction next-door.
I can imagine this place could get busy, but it wasn't that busy when we were there.
This one is well worth the visit.
You'll see, compare them yourself.","Wonderful waterfalls with a decent pool, change rooms, toilets and shaded areas. Buy your tickets near the car park and it's a short and beautiful walk to the waterfall. Some steep stairs and you criss cross the stream over multiple bridges to get to the falls. Well maintained. I got there on a rainy day, and it was empty.","A beutiful waterfall that is still not very popular among tourists. Easy hike and route, big accesible parking. Have to pay entry fees just like any other tourist spots in bali. Still untouched, and the waterfall is uniquely hidden inside a cave that truly defines top notch beauty. Worth a visit. Not too far from ubud area.","A very beautiful waterfall, if you visit Bali, it is definitely a highly recommended place to visit. There is also a beautiful pool where you can comfortably swim. The entrance fee is 25000 rupees. Beautiful tropical environment, I can only recommend it."

The restaurant newly opened in 2024 and offers great food and very friendly service.,"Another restaurant that charges higher prices than they write on the menu. To the manager: add the 15% you're adding at the end already on the menu items. I don't care that everybody else does it like that as well. There's no benefit to the customer. I'm going to a restaurant in my free time, I don't want to calculate percentages in my head in my free time.","Nice place,, peaceful atmosfer surrounding bamboo trees.
