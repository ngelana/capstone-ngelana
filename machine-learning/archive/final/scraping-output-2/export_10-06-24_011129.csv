Breakfast was good. We could not use pool but it looked great. Location is convenient taxis were available on app. 15 20 mins from airport.,"Lived in for 2 days. Staff are very nice and helpful. It's very convenient to have a shopping mall right behind the hotel.
Quite disappointed that The bed sheets , pillows and towels are not clean. So i have to buy my own towels for it. The bathroom is a bit smelly too","We just checked in 8:15pm, 25th May; Everything is fine but we were shocked that TOWEL & bedsheets provided by the hotel! Dirty & with stains.

30 mins later hotel sent us 3 nice & clean towels & a sorry cake. Good things of this hotel: nice breakfast, well connected with the Mall Galeria Bali. 5 mins covered walk way","price is very, verrrrry cheap considering the spacious room. it's not too clean though, and one time the engineering came to fix the shower with their shoes on but they probably forgot. but overall it's a nice place to stay and really worth your money!","This hotel is far from everywhere. But the worst part has to be the little details - jammed trash can lid, dingy pool bar, housekeeping that doesn’t replace very visibly dirty towels, damp smelling shower, hairdryer that barely blows any air, non-standby pool staff during pool hours, etc. Literally typing this as I’m staying at this hotel and I absolutey would not recommend staying here. There are much better budget hotels/lodgings elsewhere.

The only upside I can think of is the bed which is pretty stiff, which is good for someone with back/shoulder muscle issues."

The room was great even though some details not cleaned properly. For the price it's actually more than we expected maybe because the property is under maintenance. The pool is big and really nice and clean. We stayed for 4 days anyway. And also the breakfast were great. Definitely would stay again with my wife. Can't wait to see the improvements until we visit Bali again. Cheers team🍻,"I recently stayed in room 423 and found it to be quite suitable for solo travelers. However, I would hesitate to recommend it for families or couples. The room rates are very affordable, with a four-day stay costing only 81 SGD. While the accommodations are budget-friendly, management needs to improve the restaurant’s offerings, as the food did not meet my expectations.”",Location is overall good cause it's in the heart of kuta. Rooms were not clean and had a musty smell to them. Shower did not work and the front desk didn't anything about it after being told 3x.,"Room was dirty and dark. Bed linen was dull and smells bad. The cleanliness of the toilet was the worst, looks like they don't maintain the hotel. Housekeeping is not available after 6pm, which is not make any sense.
Luckily we only stayed for a night and checked out very early in the morning.","I'm not sure how they called the 4Star hotel. The hotel is very back dated. No coffee in the restaurant (after breakfast).
Room had women hair and not clean. They will make you sign a concern form at reception when you arrive. Which says if anything is broken, then the customer is liable for it. Didn't signed without viewing the room. Later found room TV is broken. Then change to different with pictures below you can see. Never signed concern form I moved around Bali. But this hotel I found little dodgy"

Staff very friendly and helpful.
Bed comfortable.
Room food/drink service quick.
10/15 minute walk to kuta beach
Air conditioner works great
Large rooms
Spa massage was good
When we arrived 10th May, our original pool room was not available, however the staff were very apologetic and room was sorted next day.

Negatives:
Bathroom/sink/water had a bad smell.
Room with private plunge pool- does have a roof  for privacy (good), however does make the pool water very cold. We didn't swim much as of it been cold. No natural sun for warmth.
Pool needed to be cleaned, there was lots of things floating in the pool.
Breakfast continental small selection, compared to other hotels. Some food was cold.
Hotel pool is small (didn't swim in to though)",Amazing hotel!!! We actually extended our stay because it was just too nice. The breakfast has soooo many options. The rooms are the cleanest and the staff is the best. Honestly seeing them made my day. Would 10000% recommend,"I stayed at this hotel for four nights with a group of four people, and we booked two rooms. The location of the hotel is great, as it is near Kuta beach and the local market. The hotel is quite spacious, and the reception area has a nice breeze.

However, there were a couple of issues during my stay. Firstly, there was a strong smell from the sink at the entrance of the room, which was unpleasant. Additionally, when I checked out, I needed to take my medication and asked for drinking water. Unfortunately, the staff at the reception refused to provide it to us just because we had handed over our room keys to them.","Good hotel especially for the price we paid, the location is good for using the app grab. But for walking wise to beach and markets it’s 20 plus minutes… fairly clean"

The hotel staffs are not at all cooperative. They don’t care abt customers. Midnight they denied me a small bottle of water & made me to run all over the place to get a drinking water. When asked the receptionist guy told if you want you can go and complain the manager and they don’t care. The rooms are below average . In a day they will provide only two 500ml bottles of water. And they don’t care if you have family members  you will not get water. Also while using washroom and bathroom entire world can see everything is transparent,"I gave 20,000 rupees and asked the counter staff to wake me up in the morning. Unfortunately, the counter staff charged the money but didn't wake me up, which caused me to miss my flight. I was very disappointed. The appearance photos of the hotel were wrong, and the other first and second floors were not ventilated in the basement.",Love the place n room. Good spot to sleep if u want affortable place near to airport.,"The hotel is a bit dated and run down, but it’s kept overall clean and tidy.
Unfortunately I cannot say the same about the designated breakfast area.
The area is dirty, messy, left empty and unattended with ants everywhere.
The first morning I went to have breakfast at 8.45; all the hot plates were empty, the dining plates were dirty with old food stuck to them, the coffe area was packed with empty sachets of sugar, full of ants, no more coffee or tea or butter or jam.
The staff was in the kitchen on their mobile phones.

I complained with the front desk to find exactly the same situation the day after.

The prawn crackers were old and stale, the water in the water dispenser hadn’t been changed or refilled for 3 days.
I asked one of the staff to replenish the jam and when I spread it onto the bread it was full of what it appeared to be rat droppings.
I asked the staff member to find out what it was and he never came back to me.

The poor quality of the breakfast service is putting the health of the guests at risk; they should be ashamed.
The level of care and cleanliness is appalling; in Bali is  easy enough to catch Bali belly but this hotel puts guests at high risk of contracting much more dangerous illnesses.

For this reason I will never stay in this  hotel again nor I will recommend it to any of my family and friends.

The front desk facility is run very professionally with helpful and attentive staff.","Should be called the Cat Fish Hotel.. Really disappointed, nothing like the add on wot if.
Few things;
Room was awful and right next to a hallway where I heard people talking and a baby crying all night.
There was no mini bar
Phone in room didn't work to call room service.
I went to the gym which looked nothing like the pictures and it was dirty. When I came out they were pulling up the pool deck and I had to walk across a plank!!
I had no sleep, nearly starved to death and it was just a horrible experience. I know it's cheap to stay there but the ads were nothing like my experience. Staff were nice but unattended.
Except when they called me at 11
30 to ask when I was checking out but the phone didn't work because it never worked -.-"

Hotel rooms comfortable. The restaurant felt functional and a little austere, and had a limited menu, although the breakfast was good value.

Room was nice, wide and clean.
Contrast to some reviews, I think their breakfast was good,I quite like their croissant and their stir fry.
Staff also helpful and kind.

It's far from the beaches, but it's no problem if you rent a motorcycle. The fact that it was near mall also huge plus if you like shopping or the vibe. I stay here with family and little kid, and they love their pools and going to the mall.
Some note though, it was near emergency stasion/fire station, so sometimes you'll hear emergency sound from the truck, but I stay with kid who love it, so we think it's great attraction.","I stayed in this hotel for one night because it’s right next to shopping centre and close to airport but my experience overall was mixed
Positive point - staff member we’re welcoming which was great

Negative point - room looks alright but please guys your shower need bleaching there is a lot of mould buildup otherwise room looks ok not too old not way too modern

Breakfast was terrible this morning it looks like school kids breakfast which was really disappointing please put some effort to cook food

We have lunch in restaurant earlier which was great but breakfast buffet was terrible 😣

Unable to sleep 💤 whole night due to car and bike horns overnight as this hotel is not noise proof better not stay in there if you are looking for good sleep

My apologies but overall I am disappointed with this hotel I will not stay there again .

It offers good value, conveniently located near the airport with easy accessibility. The area is not crowded, allowing for smooth motorcycle rides or hiring a driver. However, the food, particularly the Australian steak and Margherita pizza, needs major improvement in the à la carte menu. On a positive note, the 100K rupiah breakfast spread is fulfilling.

Half of the meat feels a little bit less tender than the other half. Which it was the first time I experienced it as a crab lover. And the sauces for the crabs are way too strong that it covers the taste of the crab itself.

The place is all white and clean. The staff is quick on their feet. We also can choose the seafood from the tank directly.

We ordered:
- Salted Egg Fish Skin 🌟
Crunchy umami of salted eggs that can rivals Irvin, for Balinese you don't need to get those Irvin's from Singapore, you have the freshly made one here.
- Grouper Tim Nyonya Style 🌟
They only have the big one left, so we are left with no choice. The meat is fall of the bone and super succulent, no regrets ordering this. Soup is also delicious and fragrant.
- Pocai with 3 Eggs
Delicious mom style sauteed greens, easy on the palate, like home cooked food.

Great place if you need to bring guests to Chinese cooking style seafood and need a proper and cozy place. Will recommend to anyone for this purpose."

Rooms and shower water smell so bad, water doesnt drain that much during shower time, so it like flooding after that😓
- > when we complained about that, they said its standard like that for all deluxe rooms😱😧

Breakfast staffs were too slow, took 50min to get coffee and not that friendly.
And de day after we have to order  breakfast at the night before, still too slow… we had to hurry them coz we didn't want to miss our transportation for our day trip🥲
We were glad we found much better hotel for the rest of our stay in Bali afterward! 🙂","Room was small, no chair, slow hot water, far from attraction,  price was a bit high in the weekend, but breakfast was great","I stay in this hotel for 5 days. It will be such a good holiday since I can have a good night sleep here.
The rooms are not totally wide, but it is clean. The housekeepers cleans the rooms every single day.
Beside, they also offer delicious dishes for breakfast.
But, I only one negative comment to the hotel. It's because the bathroom floor is to slippery when it's wet.","Stayed here for 3 days and i was so satisfied. The staff was so kind. The room is so clean. Next to the hotel there's a delicious noodle too, i ate there like 2 or 3 times. It has no good view from the window but its fine and its near from kuta and close to the airport."

I stood watching the staff make Pizzas as I was waiting to order and the guy making the pizzas was grabbing handfuls of cheese and was putting a nice big amount on.

When I made my order I didn't have data so ended up watching the guy make my pizza. When it came to putting the cheese on, he looked around and found a set of scales on the shelf. He weighed the tiniest bit of cheese and sprinkled it on. It was the most pathetic amount of cheese ever.

I called him over to ask why he weighed my cheese but not all the other Pizzas (who was for the locals). He lied and said he did weigh theirs.

It's obvious they give the minimal amount of ingredients to tourists.

Look at the state of this pizza. What a joke. Couldn't even eat it. Just overloaded with sauce, couldn't taste nothing other than just sauce.","good pizza, love the thin crust meat&meat. good when you’re hungry at night and don’t know what to eat. price is on the higher side but worth it i guess.","Do not waste your time or money going to this rip-off place.

They should be called deserts not pizzas because there's nothing in them. You pay more for a medium pizza here than a large pizza at Domino's in Australia it's ridiculous and there is hardly any cheese on most of the pizza maybe 2 or t3 slices had a little bit, and there was hardly any topping on it.

The complete overpriced ripoff and I would not recommend this place and I would definitely never return.  Way to expensive for Bali and such poor quality with hardly any toppings or cheese 🧀

Dirty restaurant, poor service, unappetising rip off food.

I'd give it 1 out if 10","Worst Domino's on the island? 30 minutes delivery turnes into 1 hour 40 minutes. the pizza looks poor, there is not enough sauce and toppings, all the ingredients are dried/burned, there are no olives in extravaganza (what??), the taste is very bad and different, I usually order at Domino’s. Seminyak and knows how it should be. disappointed

Grab order GF-521, 6 dec 20:43","Idk if all the domino's outlet is like this or not. Cause this is my first time for dine in. Usually I'm using gojek to order it.
I come and stand up in front of the cashier to order, but need to wait for the staff who still making pizza. The staff not that friendly and communicative, and instead of having my ""cheesy dip"" for additional sauce, they give me a ""cheesy beef"" pizza😅 well, my bad cause I didn't check again the bill, but when i say cheesy dip sauce, i also pointing at it.
Well cause i was tired, i choose to just leave and bring my pizza + my extra pizza 😃 I'm not gonna come again"

Hope visits it again one day but everything has totally changed , so great. Excellent team between owner and workers so it’s memorable. Owner Sherly has a beautiful daughter but I missed so it’s fine not too push too much! I even trick away the workers by making em envy on me so nothing will be forgotten. Not a pleasant years during pandemic but yeah at least broken heart on Japanese girls still had Balìnese things to smile on, alone.. . Miss Tante Sherly Magdalena!","It's a good place I'm not gonna lie. The interior and exterior are really new and well built. The people in charge of are really nice and helpful. The location is very strategic. There are securities every night, and cameras everywhere which makes it a secure place.

But two flaws of this place. 1. Some of the people. 2. The Rule
They don't established any rules of quite environment. Causing one of the neighbors to play music so loud while he opened his door, talking with his friends out loud outside his room. Recently at 4 am, I woke up in the middle of the night because woman at the very end of the room just got home with her friend. Talking loudly despite it was 4AM. I wished that this place put a rule of making a good environment for the people who live here. It's just uncomfortable that there are so much noises.","One of the best kosan/guesthouse in Kuta area. Fully furnished. Super clean and very modern interior. Pretty good size of a room. It has parking area for bikes and around 5 cars. Location is the best from this place. It’s near lots of restaurants, Kuta Beach and pretty much everything. They have security and CCTV everywhere. Price is quite expensive but you get the full package, just bring your clothes and you good to go.","Pros: 1. Nice interior and exterior 2. Quiet clean 3. Strategic place 4. Security 24 hours and cctv everywhere
Cons: 1. You need to turn on the water heater 30 minutes before using the hot water and the hot water running out before you finished taking bath 2. No doormats 3. The wash basin is stink 4. No towel 5. And the price is not worth with the facilities that we get. You can get nicer facilities with the same price in another place 6. Sometimes the keeper is hang out with his friends at the lobby and smoking together and its a little annoying because my room is in front of the lobby 7. And this one is my personal problem with the management. We need to deposit some money before and its fine, but when we gonna check out and asking about the returning deposit money, they don't give me back the deposit money and the reason is the owner is in another city and we have to wait until the owner come back."
