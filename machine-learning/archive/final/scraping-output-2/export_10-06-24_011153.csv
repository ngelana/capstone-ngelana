The view is great with the sea and mountains in the distance, and the atmosphere is very peaceful. The AC is nice and cool and the water nice and warm. Owner is also kind and helpful. Easy to walk to a few nearby restaurants serving Indonesian food and convenient central location to quickly reach most locations on the island. Good internet access.","Good accommodations in the middle of the island, the room are clean and nice. The owner it's a wonderfull and nice person, the breakfast it's amazing!  You have also a really nice view from the room on the Bali island and Batur mont sometimes really beautiful","Super nice homestay, especially considering what you pay! Staff is friendly and helped me when I got ‚ÄúBali Belly‚Äù (not from the hostel food), as well as let us check out late. Rooms are clean and well kept, and they also clean them every day. Nice view from the balcony. Only downside is that the location requires motorbikes to get anywhere - if you (like me) likes riding motorbikes, the location is actually better than most since it‚Äôs easy to get anywhere on the island. Otherwise be prepared that you will need to get a cab to get dinner!","I really enjoyed my time here. The place is really nice and clean. The lady is really helpfull with everything and kind. Just one negative thing, the bathroom smells bad sometimes. Also you have to rent a scooter otherwise it will be really really hard to reach there.","Great to stay for a few days, but you will need a motorbike to get around the island. Clean rooms, breakfast included and great view. A few food places nearby and a good spot to reach anywhere on the island."

The vibes is good, it has pool, enough for a resting place to explore the nusa penida island.","I didn't stay in this accommodation. I left more than a dozen calls and text messages during the trip and forced them to use the pick-up. I suddenly changed his attitude, saying that the reservation was already full-booked because i didnt accept their offer. The pick-up price was too much. I suddenly lost my place to sleep on my way to the hotel at 8 p.m. I spent 3 hours looking for accommodation in Nusa Penida during the peak season. They force us expensive pickups with using the payment system at the accommodation. If i need proof, I will attach the conversation we had in whatsapp.","Locality is good.
Swimming pool is compact and good.
Place is well maintained.

Some basic amenities in the room can be added like a kettle, cupboard was not maintained and has less space to store things.

Overall it is good to stay.","great service and atmosphere! they have a corn farm, but i'm not sure if you're allowed to grill it... maybe just ask? the staff is so friendly and genuine!"

Family-owned, the staff is super nice. If you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful stay, this area is way better than the noisy harbor. Due to its central, elevated position, besides the ocean view you also get the ability to explore every part of the island more easily.","Lovely family-owned accommodation. Clean and tidy room, cold & hot shower. The location is great if planning to visit the whole island because although you have to drive everywhere it‚Äôs just 15-30 min to the N,E,S and W.
Really peaceful and quiet environment. We rented a scooter and managed to travel around easily.","My friends and I (we were a group of 6) booked 4 rooms in this place. Before getting there, I have been in touch with the host for some concerns and they were very respnsive and accommodating. When we arrived at the place, we were surprised to find that there were actually just four rooms and we ended up having the entire place all to ourselves!! Which was exactly what we initially wanted since we all wanted to rent an exclusive villa but realized it wont be worth it for a short stay. The rooms were spacious with high ceiling, comfy huge beds and a nice pool overlooking the mountains. We went about nusa pineda on a motorbike and got back pretty late at our accommodation and since there were no nearby warungs, the host agreed to cook us dinner even though they only usually serve food for breakfast when she learned that we missed dinner and most places are already closed. Her name is Ari and she is a very nice girl and helped us during our stay with anything. The place is located at the center of Nusa Pineda so it was convenient for us to go around and see around. I would totally recommend this place even more so if you are a group and wants to have the place all to your selves.","I paid 196K for 1 night, booked with Agoda. And I was along there üòÅüëå The guesthouse is quite close to the road, which is a bit annoying, but it was quiet at night.

There are few dishes in the menu, those I tried were really really tasty. Ended up spending 90k IDR for 2 dishes, 2 cokes and 1 bottled water.

The vehicles are expertly handled, but the driver's limited grasp of English could be improved. Any assistance or information I sought from the driver met with little success, especially when inquiring about reaching the island. Instead of receiving helpful advice, a pricier fare was suggested.

For my boat transport, I turned to 12go Asia online, securing a much more reasonable deal than the agency's proposed cost.

Regarding the tours themselves, I experienced both the eastern and western ones. I found value in the western tour, which cost me 600k, but the eastern tour at 650k left much to be desired with only Diamond Beach and the Tree House as its highlights. Hence, I would recommend opting for the western tour.

The visit to Goa Giri Putri Temple, for which I paid 250k for sarong and the entry fee, did not meet my expectations. The infrastructure wasn't tourist-friendly, making it feel overpriced. The eastern tour, despite its additional 300k cost for parking and entry fees
over and above the base amount, was completed in just 3 hours.

In conclusion, if you must choose, the western tour is my recommendation. I would also advise the agency to adopt a more customer-centric approach, rather than treating customers merely as sources of revenue. Thank you, and best of luck for your future services.","Good place , nice view ,friendly guide next time will coming again,driver handsome üòçüòç",Great driver for nusa penida!
