I love the coffee, but mostly came back for the atmosphere and the lovely people in there. It's something that make you feel belong to the place. The staff told me that their kitchen will start burning soon = there'll be foods too!! Very excited for the upcoming new menu. Will definitely come back again and again.","A very comforting place to hang out, friendly staff and delicious food. Their garlic mushroom egg and baby tomato avocado have always been my favourite. The avocado is so creamy, and all of the components in this toast are so nice. The tanginess of the tomato compliments the avocado so much. The garlic mushroom and egg are so savory and balanced.","It is a lovely place in a calm area with good drinks and food (but small portions - more like snacks, not main meals).",A very beautiful and cozy establishment with a beautiful outdoor area! A great place to drink a caramel latte with ice and chat with friends. I recommend,"Honestly, it's kinda hard for me to find some place to do my work in the Tabanan area with a calm atmosphere until I found this cafe. The atmosphere here is very calm and nice for working or doing assignments.

The service is really nice! I'm a local person and they treat me like they treat a foreign people as well haha, keep it up! I am kinda picky about the taste of the coffee, but I can say the coffee here is just my type. Will come back for sure and try the other menu!"

The place has a warm family feel and all the staff were kind and helpful. I booked the get it all package and it was the perfect mix of surfing, yoga, massages and downtime to relax by the pool - all of which were fantastic! The daily breakfast and lunches were delicious and I enjoyed the flexibility of having dinners free. I hope to be back soon! I can‚Äôt recommend Pelan Pelan enough, go for it! Many thanks and best wishes to the entire team ‚ù§Ô∏è",Pelan Pelan was a super friendly place to go as a solo traveller. It was great to get to know the other guests as well as the rest of the Pelan Pelan family. The food was delicious and the perfect complement to the surfing! I definitely felt fit and healthy.,"Absolutely loved my stay! Everything is well organized, the staff is amazingly friendly and will help you with any question. The surf teachers were very good and only 2 people with 1 teachers. The kitchenstaff makes delicious healthy  food for lunch. And really enjoyed the yoga and massages in the afternoon. I felt really welcomed and made some friends for life. Thank you so much for everything!","Pelan Pelan was an experience I will take with me through my life. It was beautifully, unexpected how my trip happened and I was welcomed by such a kind, friendly staff. The accommodations and food were excellent. Surf lessons were awesome. We all had a lot of fun on the water. After a long day, a massage is all you need. Fabulous treatment. Thank you for such a wonderful stay! I hope to be back one day. üòéüôèüèºüòä","Beautiful mini tropical retreat in the middle of lush paddy fields - far enough from tourism central for you to avoid it and easily accessible enough to Canggu and further - if you want it.
Fantastic crew that care for you and the quality of your stay with genuine warmth and care.  Every detail is thought of with care and attention and hands down the best surf guides I have ever experienced "

The food was very affordable. 45k Rupiah (~$3) for two people   It included 2 fresh coconuts and 2 small meals.  The fried chicken was tough but edible.  The noodles and vegetables were fresh and tasty enough.

Two issues - 1) there isn‚Äôt really a working toilet or much in the way of plumbing.  There is a toilet but it doesn‚Äôt flush and is basically just sitting over a whole in the ground.  But the bathroom doesn‚Äôt smell too bad and it‚Äôs cleanish.
2) there seem to be a nonstop gaggle of Balinese men politely chatting amongst themselves.   Which would be quaint if they weren‚Äôt also smoking cheap cigarettes endlessly.

The lady who runs the place and cooks is quite sweet.  Not great English though.","I have been here three times. It's very peaceful place, with delicious and cheap food. I wish to come here again when I visit Bali in the future.","Visited here yesterday. What a spot it is. Quite rural next to the fields. It was just a lady on her own cooking. Really pleasant. Food was really good for price the menu that you see that's 3 years old it's the same price. We got 2 Sprites, 2 Mie Goreng, Fries and a Omelette and left 100K and that was enough for a tip too.
Would highly recommend!","Great spot, delicious food, cool vibe‚Ä¶highly recommended if you would be close to Tanah lot","Great spot! Chill place to grab a lunch on the way to the Tanah Lot temple. Great food, authentic vibe, lovely service. And just for a few $! üôÇ Definitely recommended for people travelling low cost! ü§©"
