Kuta Sel., Kabupaten Badung, Bali 80361, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=11398126049663171941,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 4725333,hotel,"hotel, resort_hotel, lodging",4.3,787,,Hotel is dirty and run down. The pool area was quite literally a health hazard with the decking not being nailed down properly. Our room was dirty with black hair everywhere. Breakfast was overpriced for what it was (cold eggs and fruit sat out). The room was spacious however the staff were not that helpful if we request towels etc and it was just purely unsanitary. You can stay at many much nicer places for the same price so avoid this hotel.,"Pros: Stayed here for 2 nights with a partner. Room is very spacious, surrounding is quiet. Good for those for look for peacefulness (but i do feel like we were the only ones staying, didnt see that many guests but maybe just wrong timing).

Cons: The lighting everywhere was just so bad. Many abandoned rooms, even the swimming pool, shops and bar. Room is a bit dark with ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô ambience especially after sunsets. I could barely sleep during my stay here.","Cleanliness: poor. Everywhere I saw simply needs cleaning. I think only cleaning the whole area they can get rid of the funny smells here and there including room. Minimum toiletries. Didnt see housekeeping service or anyone at corridor during our stay. Bedsheets and towels were not replaced - good for environment tho. They did pick up our trash. No cleanup.

Lights: need to be changed. It's murky everywhere at night. Makes it uncomfortable, really. Room also dark. Only bathroom has sufficient light, creepy tho. Funny.

Food: didnt order in room dining so no comment. Breakfast all cold, menu could have been better. Omelettes were piled in one pan. Cold. No salt pepper but they provided chili sauce. Nasi goreng, rice noodles, overcooked stewed veggies and fried fish nugget. All cold.

Pool and  bar seemed abandoned.  Didnt try gym, didnt even ask.

Access: narrow residential road up hill. Takes 30-45 car ride to get to shops and places to eat.

Overall: the hotel needs cleaning, refurnishing, repair here and there. Receptionist kept saying that 200 rooms in the hotel was almost fully booked but it felt empty, really. A few guests showed up at resto for breakfast and that's all. Hotel operations under staffed - quite contradictory to the claim that it was almost full.
Our deluxe room was at 5th fl. Unusual floor numbering: L, LL, 5, 6, 7. Lobby smells funny.

I do hope the hotel gets what it needs to get back in market. üôèüèºüôèüèº","The rooms are huge and the staff are lovely.
It's cheap for a reason, some places need cleaning, and we had some trouble (toilet having trouble flushing, card key not working) but the staff helped solved it quickly.
Props to the lovely staff.","Avoid this place at all costs!  If I could give this hotel zero stars, I would.  The location is a deserted nightmare, miles from anything.  Upon arrival, the feeling of abandonment was overwhelming.

Our room looked like it hadn't been touched since the last guests fled in terror.  The bedsheets were stained and clearly unwashed, and when housekeeping come everyday they just made the bed and didn‚Äôt change them.  The bathroom was a moldy nightmare. We had an unwelcome RAT scurry across the floor during our stay. We immediately exited the hotel and had to find another place to stay, away from Uluwata within the hour. Hotel advised we would receive an email confirming a refund for our stay however we have heard nothing since leaving.

The overflowing bins were everywhere.  Housekeeping was a ghost, never to be seen.  Our attempts to alert the staff of these issues were met with indifference. We rung the reception 3 times one night and no one answered. They did absolutely nothing to address our concerns.

Do yourself a favour and spend your money elsewhere. There are plenty of other options out there that won't leave you traumatised and itchy."

Quiet and peaceful hotel without a lot of partying and trouble.","My wife and I just booked this place for one night as we needed a place to stay fairly close to the airport but that was in a nice area too. We were really pleasantly surprised and next time we‚Äôre back in Bali will stay longer. We really enjoyed the villa by the pool. It was private, quiet and everything we needed and more. Breakfast by the pool was awesome.","The room was horrible!
There were holes on the walls, bugs inside, rats hopefully only outside, the AC was noisy, we could hear the drops of water from the AC in the room, the smell of the room was disgusting.
Nothing like the pictures of the room in Internet.","Lovely place with a poolüòç, amazing location and such friendly people! Very fast at replying too. Always helped us with directions and ordering taxis xx definitely recommend","We were not satisfied with our staying at the hotel for several reasons. There was a strange smell in the room. One day the staff started poisoning insects without warning and all the smoke came into our room. The mattress was dirty. The hot water ran only for a minute. The soundproofing was awful, we were constantly awaken by neighbours and cats.
There was also a problem with air conditioning. It was too cool in spite of the temperature we set up.
Generally the room was rather dirty and the cleaning wasn‚Äôt qualitative. To my mind this hotel isn‚Äôt worth its price and rate."

What I like:
- internet is good near swimming pool
- small cafe inside, and nicer cafe in front. Both are cheap
- easy to enter big road with motorbike/car
- rooms don't have electricity meters, you will not hear annoying beeping at nights (very important for me)
- gym and pool table
- have laundry
- fast to answer email, whatsapp
- rooms have sink to wash face or plates
- electricity plugs near bed and small bed table, nice to charge phone at night
- parking for motorbikes and cars inside
- no noise from outside, even though it's near big road it was quiet most of the time

What I don't like:
- internet works only near swimming pool or in rooms near swimming pool
- roof is made from iron sheet, very noisy during rain
- swimming pool is usually cold because covered by tree and have leafs from that tree
- using laundry may take up to 5 days to wash your clothes
- reception closes at 4pm or 5pm, to checkin late you need to arrange by phone or email
- kitchen is only one and was far from my room

Overall I liked, and I have pretty good price","Good place, cheap price and close to all beaches. Have a good public kitchen, wifi, pool and a small but good gym.

If you like Sushi or delicious Japanese style food then Sushi Tei is all you need.

I Highly Recommend","I visited Sushi Tei in Bali recently and unfortunately, it was not up to par with my expectations. Although the food quality was similar to other branches, the service was quite poor. The waitresses seemed to be inattentive to the customers' needs and we had to call them multiple times to place our orders. Furthermore, they even made a mistake in our order.

I would suggest avoiding this place during lunch hours on the weekends as it can get quite noisy with children running around and screaming, which can be a bit annoying.",Wow. I highly recommend this place. The choice of food and quality are on the high end. Prices are reasonable. Service ok,"I dine here once every week and always have a great time. The dishes are all nicely presented and taste great. The menu is indeed extensive, as with other Japanese restaurants. You can never go wrong choosing any of it, for experience. But to me, salmon belly dishes are always at the top 3 and a must to have on my table üòÅ"

Surprisingly, the sushi were really great for the price and yeah the price is considered afforable. We have ordered quite a lot of things since we were super hungry. We ordered Tuna Tataki, Gyoza, Edamame, Sashimi Set, Tuna Tartare Roll,  Creamy Salmon Roll,  Philly Roll and Ahi Crunch Roll.

Edamame wasn't well cooked (still raw), Tuna Tataki was really amazing, Salmon Sashimi from Sashimi Set was amazing (Fresh and yummy Salmon), Tuna Tartare Roll was also amazing, Creamy Salmon Roll was again amazing, Philly Roll as well super amazing and least favorite was recommended by the server Ahi Crunch Roll to us was not good and we didn't like it at all. To give a point as well that the cream cheese they used for the sushi was amazingly delicious.

The service was so so, they just need to smile a bit more but the food came to us crazy fast which was super great when you are hungry. So kudos for that!

They serve live seafood, Hong Kong style DimSum and cuisine.
The food we order is more toward the afternoon tea style.
Pretty good in taste.
If you are craving for some HK cuisine, Thai can be a pretty good place.

But their service can be a little slow. Could be the reason of insufficient staff running around on the floor.
Other than that, everything is good.","Strategic restaurant located on level 2 in Sidewalk Jimbaran Mall.

We have been a loyal customer for this restaurant and almost everytime we were in Jimbaran area, we will stop by to have a meal here.

Live seafood, rice, noodle menu were always fresh and tasty, however Hong Kong style DimSum especially the chicken feet need to be improved. Vegetable portion lately were also getting smaller. The wonton skin used to be thinner and softer with tender juicy meat.
Squid salt and pepper was thickly breaded and soggy, not crispy as usual.

Also their service and product knowledge can be annoyingly slow.  Could be the reason of insufficient staff running around on the floor.

Since this is one of our favorite restaurant, we hope this review will be useful for management to improve the taste/portion of foods and staffs","The restaurant serves dim sum from 10:00 -15:00 ü•ü

We ordered a couple of dishes and shared it amongst us.
Everything from food, service to ambience was excellent.

The duck was chopped into large pieces and they had bones. And then they brought the child a chocolate cocktail with a flyüôà. Moreover, they did not want to give a discount, they only offered not to pay for a cocktail with a fly. Although we only ate half of the duck, it was only because the child was very hungry.
