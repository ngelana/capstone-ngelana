There, peace reigns supreme. Green of paddy fields combine with blue of the sky and the water as just magnificent. It's definitely a place to put on your trip to Bali.","I stayed here for two nights and it was great. But I think I wouldn’t stay much longer here as there is not much to do around the hotel.

The hotel is located a little up the mountains. The views from the balcony and the hotel grounds are spectacular. You get Ricefield views on both sides of the hotel and watching the sun rise behind Mount Agung is magical. As the hotel is somewhat elevated, the evenings and nights can get a little chilly. I didn’t need airconditioning in the room.

I stayed on the second floor, I believe it was the Superior Joglo room? It was comfortable and I loved the wooden finish. Great views from the room and the bathroom was very nice. Service of the staff at the hotel was excellent. Very friendly.

The only thing area where I think there is more room for improvement here is the food, which were fine but not great. And since this a bit of a remote location, you don’t have many other options for your meals.",Fine location as an overnight hotel between the north and south of Bali. It is located in the middle of the rice fields and the view is beautiful. The hotel's restaurant has a small Italian menu including good pizzas. It could use a little paint here and there but overall fine,"We loved our stay here. The staff was very helpful. It's located in the middle of beautiful rice fields. The food is not expensive, but also not very exciting. Highly recommended.","The view really says it all. Great rooms, delicious food, and all at affordable prices."
