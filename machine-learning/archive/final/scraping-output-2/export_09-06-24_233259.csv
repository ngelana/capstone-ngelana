Gunung Agung stratovolcano is the highest point on Bali. It dominates the surrounding area, influencing the climate, especially rainfall patterns. From a distance, the mountain appears to be perfectly conical. From the peak of the mountain, it is possible to see the peak of Mt Rinjani on the nearby island of Lombok, to the east, although both mountains are frequently covered in clouds.","This temple has a lot of steps down, but you get to a set of ancient tombs, making it quite different from the usual Bali temples.",One of the Best views in indonesia,Started besaik at 1130pm for Sunrise didn't manage to complete.
