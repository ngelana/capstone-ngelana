I can highly recommend Camaya! The view from our house was stunning, overlooking mountains and rice fields. It was very quiet and calming, only the sound of nature around.
The service is amazing and fast and the staff is very welcoming and helps you in whatever you need.
It was super clean and the most comfortable bed..
The jacuzzi was very easy to heat up and perfect to relax with an open view outside.
Even though the bamboo house is partially open, we didn‚Äôt see any insects or other animals in the rooms.
The food of the restaurant is very delicious and there‚Äôs many vegetarian and vegan options with vegan cheese etc for those who want it.
I will come back for sure!",Camaya was one of the most beautiful places I have ever been to. The house is so unique and crafted very well. My husband and I stayed two nights as part of our honeymoon but we could have stayed forever. The staff was amazing. They were very responsive to everything you needed. The food was also amazing. They had beautiful and thoughtful menus not only for food and drink but for the activities offered locally as well. I can‚Äôt say enough great things. It was great to be immersed in nature. We loved hearing the birds and watching the geckos catching their dinner each night too! It‚Äôs a magical place that I hope to return to.,"This is a MUST STAY for a once in a lifetime experience. Not only are the views incredible and the experience is unique, but the service is unmatched. Staff were always there to help us and had all items we requested. We had an elopement ceremony here and they even helped set up a private dinner overlooking the rice fields. It is all open air, so of course you‚Äôre signing up to be a part of the wildlife. It was as expected and a wonderful experience!","Stayed for 2 nights and it was no other place I‚Äôve stayed before! First of all the view from the villa was breathtakingly beautiful and the place was perfectly clean! We arrived late in the evening and the team took well care of us, they helped us check in and transported us to the villa and was extremely kind and helpful! All the food was amazing with it being delivered quickly to the villa if we wanted to! All the food we had was delicious and beautifully dished! nothing to complain about! Highly recommend staying here, it‚Äôs an experience to not forget! üôåüèºüòä","Our time at Camaya Bali was nothing short of enchanting! From the moment we arrived, we were enveloped in a world of serenity and beauty. The attentive staff greeted us warmly, taking care of our every need and ensuring that we felt right at home. As we were escorted to our villa, we couldn't help but be captivated by the stunning views of the rice terraces that surrounded us.
Throughout our stay, the staff remained attentive and accommodating, always just a message away on WhatsApp. Whether we needed to order something or had a question, they were there to assist us with a smile. The level of service was impeccable, and we were consistently impressed by the quality of the food and the genuine hospitality of the staff.
Speaking of the villa, it was a true oasis of luxury and comfort. Waking up to the sight of the sun rising over the rice terraces was a sight to behold, and one that will stay with us for a long time. The villa itself was beautifully designed, with every detail carefully considered. We particularly enjoyed the open layout, which allowed us to truly immerse ourselves in the natural beauty of the surroundings.
Overall, our stay at Camaya Bali was nothing short of magical. The combination of breathtaking views, exceptional service, and luxurious accommodations made it a truly unforgettable experience. We can't wait to return!"

The breakfast alone has the power to transport you to blissful oblivion. As for lunch and dinner, prepare to be delighted by the exquisite flavors and stunning presentation of every dish! We will definitely come back!","We stayed at Camaya but the restaurant is beautiful and worth a visit on its own, and the food selection is surprisingly vast for feeling so remote. They have amazing breakfast, tea and coffee, oat and almond milk options, and were able to accommodate a food allergy (cows milk for me) and have some good vegan options, even vegan grilled cheese, and gf bread. The Nicoise salad was amazing, the lime smash was a great non alcoholic mocktail, had it multiple times, and the pasta was delicious. My husband and I also tried the seafood paella for two, it was lovely. Some of the best food  we have had in Bali.",The food and service throughout our stay at Santai was excellent. Leo was very very accommodating to all of our requests. We throroughly enjoyed every dish curated and  prepared by Leo. Will be happy to be back! üòä,One of the most amazing places we‚Äôve sat and ate at with magnificent views. We travelled two hours to get there on recommendation and it was totally worth it,"The atmosphere, view and experience was absolutely breathtaking! and the staff was so kind and helpful!
