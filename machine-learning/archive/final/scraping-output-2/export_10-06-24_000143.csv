Just the location & the view in the morning are worth 42 stars.
On top of that you get very nice rooms, a welcoming family vibe & nice breakfast & lunch/dinner if you need.
As for visiting the ‚ÄòWater Gardens‚Äô, you don‚Äôt even need to take your bike/car. Just walk down across the rice fields and‚Ä¶ voila!","Lovely homestay with a generous family. The views from all rooms are spectacular overlooking terraced rice fields and mountains. We enjoyed our huge breakfast from our patio.
A stroll down the stairs brings you to two cute,  private pools overlooking the fields. Fresh mountain water flows through them and it's crystal clear. We took the scenic walk to the Water Palace. The pathway runs alongside right next door to Tirta Gangga for 300 mtrs.
We were only meant to stay one night, ended up for two. We will be back here.",This place is paradise. I stayed in the house which is not with the other houses but you have to walk through the jungle a little. The view was amazing and there were no neighbours around. The PERFECT place for meditation and introspection. I stayed there for 10 days. Every morning I woke up with a smile. Another day in paradise! ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Quiet and peaceful homestay near Tirta Gangga with the most fantastic views! The weather was bad during our 3d2n stay here so we were at the homestay for most of the time. Always nice to wake up and see the vast rice fields in front. The owner was nice to offer mie goreng for dinner for 25k when it rained so hard we couldn‚Äôt get out. The open bathroom was interesting. No ceiling, so there‚Äôs good air circulation, but could be a bit embarrassing on certain situations.

There is a pool few steps below the homestay but never got the chance to use it due to the consistent rain.

Generous breakfast. Banana pancake and mix of fruits including rambutan and pandan cake. Coffee was included as well. And hot water available is available upon request.","Fabulous location with views across to Mt Lempuyang but minimal facilities. No hot water, no tea or coffee making, scant breakfast. Eat next door at Pondok Batur Indah."

Very clean inside, hot water, comfortable bed (one big queen size bed). The room is spacious and nicely decorated, there is a  pretty view on the rice terraces and a stylish garden around the place. A good home made breakfast is included. We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend this place for those who seek for comfort and relaxed atmosphere.","Very very very nice homestay!!

Our host was also our guide for the 2 days we stayed at their home. They have 3 small independent houses they rent and are willing to accommodate for their needs, be it deliciously cooked meals or private transportation around the area or towards the next destination.",Lovely small guesthouse run by a very nice family.  Just a short hike down hill to the water palace.  They cooked up a nice evening meal for me at a very reasonable price.   Good internet that never let me down.,"We stayed 4 nights, the room and the view are really nice and the owner very kind, but I found it too expensive for what it is. For 360 000 idr/night there is no AC and the fan doesn't work (it turns so slow that on or off it makes no difference, really!), there is no restaurant and to eat at night you have to play Indiana Jones to go down to the main road through jungly stairs with your own light or go to another homestay facing many barking dogs, also the hygiene of the breakfast fruit salad should be considerably improved. For the rest it is a really nice place with a considerate owner, I just think a fair price should be around 200 000 idr considering the other homestays we have stayed.","I have been staying always in the nicest hotel with budget,and this room one of my favorite,cos i felt like having my own villa even tho only hotel room but has incredible view of nature.. much love for this place . Hopefully the owner will get success for beginner in their business cos he deserve it."

This place is beautiful - not only the view, but also the garden is stunning. If I had to give it a name it would be ""the mountain sanctuary"". It felt very calm and is the ideal place if you're looking to disconnect from all the buzz Bali has to offer. It's also a small place, so you won't have many other guests. It's only 4 bungalows for now...

The staff is also exceptional. Michiyo, the Japanese owner, is very friendly and we enjoyed a nice conversation over a nice cup of tea upon my arrival. And the breakfast I had was also very nice...the staff is very attentive and adaptive to your needs.

I was at first worried about missing AC, but not to worry. It's surprisingly cool as it's up the hill and you have a constant breeze...I did not feel uncomfortable at all.

I will definitely come back in the future and urge you to check out this place. Even if it's only for a night...it's unique!","Undoubtedly it was my best weekend in Bali. Rooms are perfect but especially garden, trees and jungle surrounded us. The view until the ocean is like a miracle. This hotel is like you are meditating in a temple: peace. Service was also very good.","This place was so beautiful,and very peaceful and very quiet place to stay. The room is very clean, private with balcony and on the top of the hill with the natural view is so amazing. It's very recomended for those who like to do yoga, and meditation. Very close to Tirtagangga water palace, you also can walk down around the village, and traditional local market. The price was so reasonable, with breakfast included. And also very friendly staff. What an amazing place..wanna come back again. üòäüëç","I have visited this area of Bali many times since 1988 and this is the best place to stay in Tirtagangga. Perched atop a verdant hill, this cozy accommodation commands a magnificent view over lush sawah and bukit farther to the Lombok Strait.  The rooms are always kept clean and comfortable and the garden is so beautiful. The owner is helphul and the staff are friendly. I am glad to hear they resume the operation after two years suspension with some renovations to the rooms.  Secluded and quiet, an ideal place for musing; never for the party type. If you need some activity, you can hire a veteran local guide for trekking around this pristine countryside, which still keeps the atomosphere of Ubud decades ago. Or enjoy swimming in the pool in the Tirtagangga Palace just 10 minutes down the hill, or snorkeling in Amed, only about 20 minutes by motorbike.
It was at their restaurant that I savored the truly excellent tasty arak. It was so fruity and just out of this world!","Geriasemalung is a really serene and restful place to stay. It offers a pleasant, warm-colored room and a clean bed that ensures a good night's sleep. The view of the rice field, city, hills, and beach from the room is amazing. They serve western breakfast as well as some traditional local breakfast options. Geriasemalung is the greatest place to get away from the crowds and spend a wonderful stay in Bali!(^^)"
