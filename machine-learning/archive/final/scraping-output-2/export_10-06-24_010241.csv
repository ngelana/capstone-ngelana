The chicken seasoning is super savory and delicious.  The chicken is also very tender, easy to chew, so even if it is consumed by children, they will easily swallow it.  The dining area is spacious with an open-air model, so the air circulation is excellent.  The service is also friendly.  BTW the serving time is surprisingly quite short and the chicken gets to the table warm.  In my opinion, the price of drinks here is relatively expensive when compared to other places.  The parking lot is not that wide, I guess it's only about 4 cars. Beside fried chicken, they offer another Indonesian menu, such as gudeg, karedok, sayur asem, etc.","Authentic fried chicken, sambal taste good and the chicken so tender.

Service is good, has a Bell you can use to call them. Kinda pricy, 80k+ for pork, 20k+ for one piece of chicken.

Overall a good place to bring family, since they have cheap packages that comes with alot of different food.","I have a dinner yesterday with my family. It's rainy day, but the service still good and humble. We buy a package for 4 person, it's include grilled food (shrimp, fish, squid, chicken, clams), plecing kangkung and urab for veggie.

We ordered bebek garing which is of of their recommendation. It was okay, looks clean, taste were plain i expect more flavor out of it, but it was crunchy for sure. sambals were okay. They also recommend seafood which by the looks of it may taste good.

By the way, they sell pork so halal is questionable.",The place is immaculate. Feels really peaceful & the food was great as well. The menu is not in english and the staff does not speak english well so prepare a google translator. :) Great experience.

However, it's important to note that, like many other food stalls, managing expectations regarding the service is crucial. While the food is top-notch, the service might not align with traditional restaurant standards. It's more of a grab-and-go setup.
