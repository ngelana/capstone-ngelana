The location is amazing and the design really interesting, tempting us to go in for breakfast.
The entrance is thru a market garden and the wooden walkway was broken so we had to detour thru the vegetables.
The prices are cheap but the menu is a bit mixed up and the waitress was friendly but looked very shocked to see us as there were no guests staying in the cabins. I ordered our food in Bahasa as she seemed to have no English.

The food was poor. The flies at our table while we waited for our
food were horrible - the tables really need a good clean. The toilets were also not very clean and there was no soap to wash my hands afterwards.

When we went to leave, the market garden was being irrigated to the waitress (also the cook) kindly took us on a detour thru the beach and then we had to climb a wall to get back to our car which was difficult for one of my friends.

In summary, it's a lovely spot that needs some love and affection to get it up to shape. I would not go back.","Great place by the lake, wonderful view from the floating pontoon. The food was freshly cooked and flavoursome, and the staff was super kind and ready to adapt the recipes to take my food allergies into account. We loved it so much we went there 3 times during our stay!","The places where you stay in this restaurant are great and cosy. However, the food was terrible. Firstly, there were way too many flies and we were constantly attacked by them. The service was very bad as the waiter didn't speak very good English and forgot some of our orders were forgotten. The veggie burger was disgusting and the spaghetti Bolognese was way too sweet and came with 4 small granules of meat. This is probably the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Would highly recommend avoiding this restaurant.","Nice place, way bigger amount of local tourists,than foreigners staying in. They have nice dishes to choose from, as well you can get a boat trip to Trunyan cemetery, or hire a kayak (only 30k/h)","It's quiet and comfy. I'm glad I found this place in Kintamani. We had a good rest here after Mount Batur trekking in the early morning. You can see Mount Agung, Mount Batur and Lake Batur at the same time from your room. it's absolutely amazing"

We booked the sunrise jeep tour, natural hotspring and a visit the the special trunyan cemitary. Sunia advised to go to the hot springs later in the afternoon because then there are not so many tourists. This made it very relaxing if you like the quietness. The location of the homestay very close to all options. Also for a longer stay Sunia knows all the nice places to visit. His wife has a shop nearby the house with fresh fruits and amazing snacks. You should try everything! Breakfast was very delicious as well :)
Rooms are clean and cute. Everything that‚Äôs needed is there.
Advice for when you do an early hike/jeeptour: some earplugs if you are bothered by surrounding sounds and want to go to sleep early. We weren‚Äôt bothered, but if you are a difficult sleeper it will help."
