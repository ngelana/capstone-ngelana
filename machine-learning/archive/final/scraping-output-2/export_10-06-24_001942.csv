ChIJa2xUE3YZ0i0RGAvKDGbNV74,Alam Kawi Ubud Resort & Spa by Island Escape Villas,-8.4569425,115.30454729999998,"Sanding, Tampaksiring, Gianyar Regency, Bali 80552, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=13715657028365060888,OPERATIONAL,+62 813-3936-2407,resort_hotel,"resort_hotel, hotel, lodging",4.7,285,,"We had opted for a family room,
It's spacious and clean.
The location is superb very close to nature .
The only problem here is food.
They have very  limited options and their weird rule of closing as early as 9:30.
They didn't consider our request for some fruits and juice at 9:40 that it's late by 10min.we were travelling with kids.
Other than this it's a wonderful place filled with nature.
Tips you can order food through some local app from near by restaurants which is the best .","Me and my girlfriend stayed here 3 weeks ago and forgot to leave a review apologies ! The staff here are really attentive and lovely. Value for money is great here, the rooms are spacious, clean and comfy - ours had a balcony with a lovely view of the rice fields. Breakfast and dinner was very nice and very well priced. This is a relaxing place and about a 25 minute drive into Ubud town (you can ask to rent scooters at reception). Thank you for having us !","My stay at Alam Kawi Ubud Resort & Spa was a mixed experience, with both positives and negatives to consider. I booked a villa and was assigned to the Suredayu villa. While the room itself was decent, I found it lacking in cleanliness, earning it a modest 6 out of 10 rating.
However, I was impressed by the attentiveness and good service provided by the staff throughout my stay. They were always ready to assist and ensure my comfort.

The villa offered a great view, but the open-roofed bathroom design made me anxious about the possibility of reptiles entering, which detracted from my overall enjoyment. Additionally, I was taken aback when the payment went through, and the staff informed me that there would be no refund. This seemed like a red flag, as it raised questions about transparency and customer service.

Regarding breakfast, while it was passable, I found that there were better options available outside the resort. On a positive note, the pool area and facilities were well-maintained and clean, providing a relaxing environment for guests to unwind.

Although the spa area was undergoing upgrades during my stay, I appreciated that the massage therapists were still available to provide in-room treatments. The massage itself was excellent and added to the overall relaxation experience.

In terms of location, the villa is situated conveniently outside of town, offering a peaceful retreat away from the hustle and bustle of Ubud.

In conclusion, while the villa has its merits, including attentive staff and good service, there are areas for improvement, particularly in cleanliness and transparency regarding policies. However, the location and amenities make it a decent choice for those seeking a relaxing getaway in Ubud.","The place is a bit far from the ubud center. We stayed for one night when we were back from kintamani. The room is clean and quite big, the hot water works perfectly. The swimming pool is also pretty great with an amazing view. I love the vibes and the area is pretty quiet.","In bali you will not get a charging port in rooms.
And the lights are very dim.
It becomes very dark at night and has very little light in the room.
I saw some ðŸ¦Ž.
Otherwise I liked the room ambiance, pool and service.
So clean rooms and outside areas.
Location is Lil far from other places but it's quiet if u like village style stay."
