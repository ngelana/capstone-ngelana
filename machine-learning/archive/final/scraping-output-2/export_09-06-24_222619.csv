The first sign you see is only accessible by scooter. Drove a car there and tried driving to the top area but the road is too steep and slippery so had to go back. A local helped us back down when we got stuck and took us himself for a tour. Not sure what the price was because it wasnt organized but paid him 100k for bringing my wife and I and also helping us get unstuck.,Amazing waterfall. Must visited.,"Amazing natural Adventure since my first foot step,this village will make allot of memories,very wellcome people you will see how local people doing their activities,so memorable","Try to come and see this stunning waterfall, amazing and cool atmosphere here, the local people also very friendly, you will find new family there.. just come to any villagers there, they will welcome you like your own family..",little piece of paradiseü§©üòá my hometown silangjana villageüôèüèª
