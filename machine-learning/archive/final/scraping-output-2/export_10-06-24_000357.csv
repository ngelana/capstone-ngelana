Guide explained to us we cleaned from water flowing from left to right. Queue after queue until the end.
I wish we had arrived earlier so we had time.
We walked around the temples. Some areas won't let you take towels (even dry) in, or if you're wet, you couldn't enter.
Nice special temples. Locals also come here to pray and cleanse.
The stalls on the exit way were a bit annoying. I was checking on a painting. The shop owner initially said 300k. Then I said I was just checking, and she put down to 200k. I really had no intention to buy and walked she had it to 100k.
I am not used to negotiating, so I would rather shop at a place that has price tags.
Also, ATM at temple charges 30k for every withdrawal and limits 1000k each withdrawal.
Bring cash with you here.","a super cool temple in the middle of the jungle. the special thing about this temple is that you can cleanse yourself, whether you are a local or a traveler. I was most interested in the villa of the President of Indonesia....🤩💪💪I will definitely come again","Amazing experience! As you enter you’re going to need a sarong which is included in your entry ticket. If you’re interested in going into the water you’re going to need a bathing sarong, this one you pay for. It wasn’t very busy so the visit was smooth. It’s a great way to experience the culture and traditions. I definitely recommend visiting.","Amazing experience, and the tour guide is so helpful with the history explanation, you can go bathing for peace of mind but the queue is contradictive with that, but it did teach you patient lol! Great tourist place, so many art stalls and shops, also the water springs are eyes-opening! Also need to buy tickets to entry.","Totally worth the trip, cleansing with holy water and beautiful ancient architecture. It has nature springs and fish pools, thousands of years old trees too. Better bring a sarong of your own for bathing. Entrance fee cash only. Bring dry clothes for change after if you want to go in the pool."

There's the option to do the ""purification"" procedure.. It takes like 15min. They provide orange rental sarong but it's recommended to bring swim wear. Much less crowded than the close by ""Julia Roberts"" temple","Very nice ritual, we paid 30k for entry and 35k for offerings.
They gave us sarongs at the entry and one guy explained to us the usage of the springs and every step we had to do for purification
Nice location, very few tourists, you pay 10k for a locker and there are some exchange rooms, don’t expect luxury","Beautiful, less busy, and even nicer than Tirta Empul if you must choose between them.  The water prayer is very immersive and peaceful and takes maybe 20+ minutes when not busy.

About 30000 cash to enter per person.","This was quite the experience! Such a wonderful blessing. Be forewarned that women on their cycles aren't allowed in the water. They gave us a dry sarong to wear down there, another to wear that got wet and then the dry one when you're done. Everyone wears a sarong. There isn't a particular swimsuit rule- I saw one pieces and 2 pieces, but you must wear the sarong. The bathroom is less than desirable, so try to go beforehand. There are a lot of old ladies trying to sell bracelets and necklaces in the parking lot and they can be aggressive, just FYI.

Overall it was a neat experience and the chilly water felt good on a hot day. They do have lockers with a key for 10,000 IDR or you could use it without a lock.","Beautiful 11th century temple used for water purification ceremonies. Far less crowded than other larger  temples on the tourist radar but in my opinion even more beautiful.
It was an honour and privilege to have spent time with and experienced a water purification ceremony performed by Putu Suciyati, her mum and cousin. They truly are beautiful, genuine humans, so in touch with there spiritually. The ceremony took around 3hrs and if you get the chance, I guarantee it will be a highlight of your Bali trip."

The food was delicious, I particularly liked pumpkin soup. The menu is rather limited, mostly based on local cuisine. Yet for me it was enough.

Ordered the following:
Vegetable salad - very fresh and crunchy
Mixed veg Balinese curry - superb yummy taste made when coconut milk
White rice
Plain yogurt - was little sweet but good
