It's easy to find and there's parking available across the road.
The staff were ""there"" but not particularly friendly.
The menu mainly consists of pork satay with a soup accompaniment.
The food is very cheap.
I  would clarify this place as.
Cheap
Dirty
Basic
But tasty..
There aren't any seats it's just a large communal floor area where everyone just sits where they want.
I would imagine that this place gets very busy at times.

Would I come back again
Probably not,  but everyone else should try the experience once","Tourists and local hotspots that are never not fully packed with people! And rightfully so.

The satay tasted amazing. There are also so many food selections too. Mostly pork menus. The prices were also reasonably cheap for a pork satay.

Worth to visit!","Pork pork i miss you haha
When you visit Sangeh monkey forest, don't forget to visit Nyoman bledor restaurant. Everything is pork you can find here. Pork sate you want?  Just visit nyoman bledor. They have 2 outlet in same road, don't worry same tested wkwkw

Usually visit bledor, you must get menu make yourself. And then the restaurant is lesehan style. Last for payment they only cash, and the method is honest they not have book rsvp or anything else. Great restaurant, for rest time and good feels.

I am really miss bledor sate","Foods are so Balinese and cheap, although the lady has almost no English but she is friendly and other Balineses join her to explain us the foods and price.","Sate Nyoman Bledor II, a very crowded place to eat pork satay. The satay sauce was delicious. We sat on the floor with carpet. During a pandemic, it was still super crowded. Near Sangeh Monkey Forest. If you‚Äôd like to come here, bring wet tissue and hand sanitizer."

This place is not famous like as much it should be, but here are some problems. It should be more clean more decorated. Entry Road is totally damaged.","Tanah Wuk which is located in sangeh is a beautiful and quiet place, which offers a beautiful view of the forest scenery against the background of the sangeh bridge.

There is also a triangular selfie deck that resembles the tip of a boat.  From this location create the best photos with the help of tongsis.  Here, it is the most romantic spot because of its shape like a boat so it seems like a photo on the Titanic.

Located in a high area and lush trees, Tanah Wuk is also often used as an outbound location or campsite.",the entrance costs 10 thousand per person. the city is not bad for being in silence and enjoying the scenery. the cafe was not working,For nature lovers its a heaven on earth you need to view and enjoy the Gift of nature
