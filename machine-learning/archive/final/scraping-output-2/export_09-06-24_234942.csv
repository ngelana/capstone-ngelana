ChIJqdM2dhIh0i0RYZknu1ZrAcU,Bidadari Ayung Petang Waterfall,-8.3836143,115.22444709999998,"J68F+HQ4, Petang, Badung Regency, Bali 80353, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=14195745520699808097,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-4643-2624,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.1,35,,"No signs, so you have to ask someone about the way. Waterfall really strong and view from the top is amazing. But place around looks like construction. Anyway if you like adventure it worth it.","Beautiful waterfall !!! But the access to go there is not in maintenance .. the iron ladder to go down to the waterfall already broken and feel so dangerous!! But thanks God i’m safe hahaha... there’s few sign to go this waterfall, better asked local people you meet in near by like i did!! Last time visit this waterfall met some local peoples there, they said tidy the path way and planning to renovate the access to this waterfall so in the future will be many people can enjoying this beautiful waterfall",This is a hidden gem. The path isn't well maintained and not marked at all. I guess that's half the adventure! You cannot go down any longer because the staircase to the ground has fallen apart but it's definitely worth seeing. I guarantee you will be the only person there if you visit!,"Not much signage to speak of - we had to turn round and we almost missed it again - it's opposite to the quarry entrance. The stairs are overgrown to begin with, which changes to dilapidated and then is literally covered by little landslides. And the bottom, the winding staircases leading to the waterfall itself are in one case no longer attached to the platform, and in the other missing stairs, with others just hanging on. We decided not to chance it and walked back up. The waterfall itself is pretty cool, though.","Amazing waterfall with 250 more or less staircase (up and down is 500 staircase!). 4 stars because it needs a little more effort to fix the access.
Overall, this is one of the recommended waterfalls."
