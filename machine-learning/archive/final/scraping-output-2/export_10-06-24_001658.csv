ChIJGfp_ZQ8Z0i0R56CJSexR3hM,Yeh Bulan Waterfall,-8.4495401,115.3744919,"Jehem, Tembuku, Bangli Regency, Bali 80613, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=1431671806838284519,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.9,112,,I loved this waterfall(s) so much! It was absolutely stunning and a great walk to it through the water. I was so lucky to be the only tourist there and a lovely local took these amazing pictures of me- thank you so much! (Pictured in last image). The guys taking the entrance fee were so friendly and chatty with me whilst I rested after the steps up from the waterfall. Would 10000% recommend a visit to this one ‚òùüèΩ,"Easy to access, a few steps on the way down but compare to other waterfalls we have seen in the area this is the easiest. The entrance is 20000 rupees per person. The way down to the waterfall will reward you with beautiful views. There is changing room on you way down in case you want to swim on the small pool near the waterfall.","A great little spot to stop! The walk is very easy, there is a change room & WC available, and it was nice and quiet. We walked to the end and enjoyed swimming in the little pool next to the waterfalls. They asked for a 20K IDR per person donation to get in. Well worth it!","On our way back to Seminyak to our next hotel from Ubud  coming our Driver stopped at this gem, it won't be a gem in the future when the social media influensers will discover this.
Wear flip flops or decent water shoes because you have to walk in the water.
The ask a small fee but that is for building the bridge and keeping it in condition.","Beautiful waterfall. To access you will need to walk into the water which makes the experience even better. After a short walk down and in water, you see this beautiful gem. It is not too crowded which makes it even more appreciated. There is no entry fee but a donation is appreciated and enables the people to keep the waterfall clean and secure."

I'm not sure what I ate, but it had spicy soup on the side, rice in the middle of the dish with different types of pork around it - tasted amazing. As you may have gathered from empty photo below - I could not even wait to snap a photo!

The only downside - they did not have meniu in English.  So... Guess? or point to the photo of dishes on the side of the cafe?",,,,
