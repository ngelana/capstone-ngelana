The Indonesia menu as breakfast is tasty, you must try their black coffee. Nice to stay here, our room was upgraded üëç","The room is spacious and clean. This is an old hotel, so please tolerate a bit of tear and wear. The receptionist who served me (for check in) was slow and not friendly (not even a smile), but the housekeeper and waiters are friendly and helpful.
I was here for a meeting and stayed for a couple of nights. The hotel is located on a very busy street so watch yourself when trying to cross the road. A bit of a drive from the airport and the traffic is horrible.","A 4 star hotel but doesn't feel like it. Old furniture, some of them need to be renewed. Guest can't open their windows for some weird reason or rules.

We asked front desk 2 times (via telephone call) for an extra bed and they told us to wait for them to inform us, but they didn't contact us at all for both requests.

It's not the best option for vacation, it's more suitable for a business trip because of the strategic location in the city.","I don‚Äôt know from where to start ‚Ä¶.
1. I have no clue who have given this hotel title 4 star seriously if I have to have this hotel rating I will have 1 star or maximum 2 star hotel due to its condition

2. Only positive point was it‚Äôs staff members were nice and welcoming other than that üòê

3. Our room was changed 3 time because room aircon were not working properly‚Ä¶‚Ä¶( only +ve point at they changed it once they know aircon are cooling room ).

4.room looks outdated everything is falling apart and old ( couch, tv , fridge )

5. Bathroom was full of mould ü§Æü§¢ and smells bad and shower area needs serious cleaning ( please use bleach to clean mould atleast it was all black inside) shower drains were not even draining well due to blockage because shower grade need cleaning too ‚Ä¶.they have to lift the grade up and get rid of stuck hairs ü§Æü§Æü§Æ.

6. We stayed at this place for 3 nights so for breakfast 1 st day was great , 2 nd day was ok and 3 rd day breakfast was disappointing‚Ä¶.

7. I will not recommend this place to anyone for your health and safety don‚Äôt stay here and trust me this hotel is not 4 star it‚Äôs 1 star better to go somewhere‚Ä¶‚Ä¶","Loved our stay! Paco and Pendi were especially outstanding with their service and friendliness, they helped us out so much. Our family would definitely stay again. Thank you for your hospitality ‚ù§Ô∏è"

however the service needs to be inproved. The cashier was very slow. And the order monitor cannot be used for QRis payment.
Payment: no change 2 times here, no Rp. 2000 change. They'll charge if you use card other than BNI. Very ineffective.
The seat are plenty, be cautious of a long wait during the busy hours after 5/6PM. Even tho they already have an empty table, they slowly let people in line to sit at the table.
Hopefully there will be improvement, i personally like the food, i just think i will order it online in the future.","I really sorry! I can't put this place on my repeat place i would come again, because they put you on waiting list before you come this place i will not recommend when you feel so hungry when you eat here, for the food the taste not really bad but i was expecting about the sambal it would be hot delicious spicy i was asking the waitress about which one sambal is hot/spicy because they have 2 choices about sambal you want order, and all the food to much oil they put on it even on ""telur dadar"" and tumos kangkung, but i still find food i can eat is skin chicken crispy if they donthave this i would not can eat ü´£ i hope they improve they are menu and also don't put to much oil on everything ü•∞ü§ó
Thankyouuuu","For me, the food is not fantastic, but good, because I am not a sambal eater. Apparently according to many who enjoy sambal, the sambal is mediocre and unremarkable.

I like the efficiency though, although there were many people, we were able to order and got our seats soon enough, and most importantly, the food arrived quickly (hungry!)

Price was good, very economical. Fast service, which is great because sometimes food takes forever in Indonesia.","Food was greasy, but tasty. They have an open kitchen which means your clothes are going to smell like smoke if you eat here.","The best place to eat for sudden hungry, they fast, and delicious sambal are top notch! They have guarantee for the food will coming before 30min.  Definitely will be back"

Parking lot is not much for car, better to use motorbike / gofood to order the food.

I dont know about others but their lava drinks is not for me.","Fried chicken with different sauces, if you are a foreigner you should know that this restaurant chain don‚Äôt have spoons or forks. You have to eat with hands ( mean fingers ) .... but it‚Äôs a good experience here. Nice and clean place with chill ac and free wifi.","As an experience it is not bad, chicken is tasty as well but there is not many choices","Finally tried this popular Chicken and cheese combo. I really loved the chicken, the spiciness qas amazingly delicious! Although I'm not really a fan dipping it to the cheese sauce. Just the spicy chicken coated with BBQ sauce already great. Probably what needs to be improved greatky was their choice of drinks. Both the Taro and Strawberry drinks weren't that good. Their dessert, the cake in cup was amazing tho. I tried the Pandan one, and it tasted wonderful!!!"

There are many Korean food options that suit the Indonesian palate, but there's no bibimbap or gimbap here.

The staff used to be stern and unfriendly, but after a few visits, they inexplicably became friendlier. I hope this attitude is maintained.

The food is tasty, although sometimes the portions are generous, and other times a bit small.","There's package for two, below 200K. Which is great compared to other Korea BBQ.

Love the Boricha! Tea with slight grilled taste, only 15K and got one big jug of iced tea.

Taste all decent. We enjoyed our visit there.

It has plenty of mozzarella cheese and taste so good! The chicken feet is tasty but when u cook, the oil is spalshing everywhere.

We had (pre paid) reservations at diana 2 but they said as we arrived that they were fully booked!
