And why they put it the advertisement on internet? Was that mean just to interest and blackmail people around?unexpectedly for me to deal with this unfair service like this.i never find any hotel services before with the biggest issues like this.it shocked me,speechless to say anything regarding the biggest problem they have experienced,unprofessionally in giving the service how to treat the customers,how to handle the service,how to make the guests interested with the services.how the customers feel the satisfaction during their staying,well,my last question is,was that wrong or faked price as I booked yesterday? It was about 59 thousand rupiahs bla bla bla per one  night and giving me 120k per one night and yes I dealed with that price.it was ok but more worse and more shocked me again at the morning as I still sleeping,the gentleman came up and knocked the door and when I heard that directly feeling trauma again thinking what's going on again and what's wrong with me?I still feeling sleepy on my eyes but feeling discomforted me to ignore it.i waked up and open the door and the gentleman saying directly without saying sorry to wake you up,sorry to interrupt your sleeping but just saying you have to pay extra or you need to pay more charge 20k thinking on my head omg I have to leave soon as I don't feel the comfortable to stay or extend.while I left the room and I was on the way finding a new place to continue my staying as I am not happy,enjoying my staying at this home stay suddenly, I got Notification by WhatsApp again and the other person(lady)messaged me and said don't forget to pay extra 30k because you have early checked in and you said you will be leaving in a few hours later.omg!!! Why not telling or explaining me yesterday about it.so confusing me again was that 20k as the gentleman asking?or 30k? As the lady asking.make feeling like I can't breath.i was happy to leave that room quick as I actually need to sleep more.i was thinking that all will be fine and ended but still continuing with the problems.i heard from the one who I charged said,impossible with that price we will never charge anyone with that price and she asked again and again,pushed me to cancel the booking I have had so quick before 2pm but as I already get stressed with a lot of things happened and again I looked at the detailed booking and thinking all is only rubbish and useless to use.feel the trauma,depressed for sure as I said I never have this bad experience in my life before,anywhere around.honestly this is not about killing someone who incharged with her/his job but can you imagine how the unfairness.as the end of my words,I recommended please evaluate all about.",Ok,,,
