You should bring your family, neighbors, friends, partner or even your enemy so you doesn‚Äôt feel alone on this big park üòÑ","Great place to go with young kids - opens from 4pm and closes 10pm.

Recommend to go when the sun goes down so you can see the light installations in which there was a boat that took us through a venetian style canal which gives a great view of the lights.

Our kids liked the train and the merry go round.

üòÄ",It's ok. A few attractions. Not big at all. It's Fun not Funtastic. Within 3 minutes you have seen the whole park. There are 2 options for tickets. 1. Only pay the entrance ticket and then pay for every attraction. Or 2. Pay ticket including all attractions 1 time.,A good recreational park in the city. The price is very affordable. Me and my sister's family had so much fun. But I think it could be improved with adding more attractions and spacious area to make it more attractive.,"I think its one of the largest amusement park in Bali. Read the reviews from other Local Guide, I think the should compare it to other entertainment place in Bali then they could give a 4 star review or even a 3 star review. Krisnaland is a one stop entertainment center, they have water park, shopping center (gift shop), food court. And everything is so cheap compare if you go to waterboom in kuta, splash in canggu, or any kids play ground in whole denpasar area. You just need to pay IDR 15k/person and an IDR 90k/person if you want to try the whole games. You could also buy a ticket inside if you want to try individual games and you have to spend only IDR 15k to 25k/person. Plus the food court that they have there are also cheap price plus and they are serious about the quality, most of the food that we have order they were delicious and a descent portion as well. Hopefully the second airport that the government planning to build finish soon so the north part of Bali will be more flourish with tourist from other part of the world."

Menu included in attached photos",Its a great activity to do with kids if you have a couple of days in Lovina. There are quite a few kids slides and keeps everyone cool against the heat of Singaraja. There were only 2 adult slides but that's OK. The food was fine.,"I am really not sure what to say about this place. Firstly we were the only people there. No-one else. There were about 20 workers sitting around watching us constantly. It was like something out of a horror movie.
To say it was dirty is an understatement.
The payment system is a joke you need to pay cash to the waterparks card.
Really not sure if there is money laundering or what the hell we just witnessed yesterday‚Ä¶.","Don‚Äôt usually write bad reviews but this place really is worth avoiding. It‚Äôs so run down and clearly got no money coming in. It is FILTHY- edges of pools covered in green algae. Bottoms of pools sharp on your feet. We spent our short amount of time here trying to not get injured or get any pool water in our mouth. Such a shame we from other reviews it is was once great. All the foot outlets are closed. There is also only 2 water slides. Silly ticket pricing (family ticket for 2 adults and 2 children is 250,000 but they will not let you purchase this unless you have exactly 2 adults and 2 children, so for 2 adults and 1 child you will pay more than for 2 children, they won‚Äôt let you buy the family ticket and just not use one child space)",Its good place for kids and adults. One of must visit place if you stay in lovina with kids. The place is clean. Food is affordable. The entrance fee is cheap. Overall is really good. We have great time here.

The host is a very kind and helpful woman. The room was great and the view is amazing. We loved the pool and the sitting area. Breakfast was great too. While there, we had a couples massage. It was probably the best massage that we have had on Bali. I don't remember both of the ladies names, but one was Umi.

The host also setup a dolphin tour for us. We didn't think it would be good, based on the online reviews, but it was so much fun and totally worth the price.

I would definitely stay here again. With such a helpful host, great room, awesome staff and a good breakfast, it was a fabulous experience.","Amazing atmosphere and great rooms, really enjoyed my stay here. Everything about it was amazing. The breakfast is very delicious, restaurant quality. And the owner is so friendly and nice. 10/10 would recommend for your next visit to lovina","A place with the great view and the cutest pets. The rooms are spacious and clean. Insects are almost none present. A recommended place to stay.
The cons are: karaoke down the hill is always a partner for your evening.","Under the name of Sing-Sing Resort. It sites in a hidden forest of Lovina, prime ricefield and the North of Bali sea view, clean and natural staff hospitality. Super delicious food taste. Heavenly atmosphere.","Beautiful property, limited number of villas, so less crowded, beautiful view of the sea, very neat and clean, very helpful and friendly management, owners personally take care of the guests.
Had an amazing stay.
Good food.
Comfortable villas.
Though it's a little away from the main market and town, little high on the mountain, but worth the stay and visit.
The co owner Dian one of the most welcoming and helpful host.
The only thing at night got to be careful with insects, lots of open space in the villa.
Rooms in the villa have air-conditioning but not the living room. So the hall is going to be really hot and humid during the day."

If you want a quiet stay in a nude resort on Bali then this is the place to be. It has a great pool (12 x 3 meters) with an excellent water quality and a nice garden. For meals you can go out of course but we had all our meals prepared by the owner Ker and her sister in law. Really excellent food, we loved it.","We absolutely loved staying at Bali Natur with Ker and her team. We were with a family of 8, so we ended up having the entire house and pool for ourselves.The location of Bali Natur is beautiful; on a mountain, with ocean view. I felt at home there. The breakfast every morning was delicious (jafle, banana/pineapple pancakes, toast with egg or traditional). We stayed for lunch every day (in between trips) and we ended up dining there for three evenings, even though there were a lot of restaurants in Lovina (the food was th√°t good!!). Ker helped us with booking trips and selecting what to do. She and her team were so friendly and helpfull! Our stay was perfect, would recommend everybody to visit Bali Natur!!","Great place to get all over tan ‚òÄÔ∏è
Ker, the hostess is very sweet and attentive, plus she prepares the best breakfast.
She can also cook lunch and dinner upon request.
We really enjoy our stay relaxing at the pool with a great view of the ocean and Lovina area.","The best way to describe our stay here would be to say it was incredible! Ker & her whole family go above and behind what you expect of a host. The cooking was AMAZING from breakfast to dinner! My husband & I never questioned what she was going to make. If you order the small dinner it's still a great amount of food & it was always cooked & served up quickly!  Her husband Gelgel drives you around on the tours most days. Very nice & funny man. Ker also gives amazing therapeutic massages. They are very relaxing so get them before bed.

The room we had was quite cozy. The shower had warm running water & the AC worked well in addition to a floor fan in the room. The have 2 small dogs that roam around & greet you throughout your stay. Even though my husband isn't the biggest dog fan, he thought they were so cute & sweet. I miss everything about this part of our vacation! Book here & you won't regret your choice.","Me and my dad had the best time here. Ker was the best host! She is kind, helpfull a hard worker and will do anything to make you feel welcome. The view, location, room and breakfast were amazingas well. loved it! Big hug for Ker and Manis"

The owner and his family met us on arrival to welcome us to his beautiful property. The villa had everything we needed and was situated in the most incredible place on the hillside overlooking both the countryside and sea. The infinity pool was the icing on the cake!
Only stayed two nights but wished it was two weeks. Everybody worked so hard to make our stay one of the best vacations ever and nothing was ever to much trouble.
Thank you for your kindness and hospitality and we hope to see you again.","We stayed 4 nights at Villa Bukit Sing Sing. A few days before we moved, I read a review of  a guy who rated this property with only 1 star. So I felt obliged to rate this property after our return.
Overall the property was good. Very good.
The family who owns the property helped us with transport and arrangements of tours and tried everything to make our stay perfect. Breakfast was included and the food which we ordered for lunch or dinner was good and from price perspective more than reasonable. Of course it was slightly more than a local low budget Warung , but still significantly cheaper than a regular restaurant.
If you expect super low budget, you better stay in a backpack or dormitory.
But if you are looking for a relaxing time in a well maintained property in the area of Lovina, this property is a good choice.","Gorgeous villa with a stunning sea & rice fields view! Very friendly staff & supportive host. The breakfast tastes delicious & we felt really comfortable all the time. The host also organised transfers & tours for us. Everything was perfect, so I highly recommend this villa!","Breathtaking views!ü§© Definitely a must-stay when you visit Lovina. Me and my husband stayed for two nights (May 14-16, 2023) in this beautifully designed villa located just 10 minutes from Lovina central. Clean and very nice rooms, and a private infinity pool overviewing the broad sea and rice fields. It was unreal. The place has an outdoor kitchen and seating area which allows you to feel the nice breeze everywhere and anytime, making you feel totally relaxed. Upon request, they provide a chef that cooks your meals for you, all you have to do is provide the ingredients. You just have everything you need and didn‚Äôt know is nice to have. We enjoyed every second of it and hope to come back soon.","The place is a brand new and serves you wonderful view. Located just near the center of the city, the place is clean and the owner provides u great hospitality.The owner is very helpful and will guide u throughout your stay. The staffs were very helpful. The place provides you with almost every facilities for an amazing place to stay in. It gives you the best experience!"
