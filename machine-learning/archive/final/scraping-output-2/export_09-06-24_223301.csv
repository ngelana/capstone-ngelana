Reachable close by feom sekumpul waterfalls.
It got 3 spots and 1 small on it's way.
Ticket is 20k per pax.","They are travel agency, bandit burglars. Stops you on the way and not allowing you to pass without paying. Like its their own territory. Near by water fall there is already offical ticket office. you can just buy ticket from there. Unfortunately police not handling these issues. I have attached their license.","There are no words that can describe the beauty of this place. We had so much fun at the waterfalls and water slides. The guide was a legend, you definitely need to support the locals and take a guide. He was super friendly and hospitable and took photos and videos of us. The area is so big that without a guide you will probably get lost and spend the whole day finding your way around the park. He took us to the water slides, fiji, and sekumpul waterfalls. We drove through rice fields and picturesque scenery that was breathtaking. Definitely the best waterfall experience in Bali. Go early because you’ll probably spend 2-3 hours there.","READ this before going to this location on google maps!!!!! This is NOT the entrance of Sukumbul , Fiji or lemukih waterfalls!!!! Just a place of SCAMMERS with parking and a swing area and a place of tickets when they even dont sell tickets!! They ask 150 000 for 1 person to bring you 300m with scooter and for a guide but you can do it on your own. You dont need to pay 150 000 per person the real price is 20 000! 300000 for 2 people for example that is 20 euro for 2 persons to see a natural waterfall this is what they ask!

I got scammed.

they reply they have autority but you have to be honest!! And advise for a guide not say we need to have 1. Its called lying what you guys do , robbing peoples money!  drive through this location , no guide needed , a 5 years old child can find the waterfalls , than go left and all the way down and  than you will see the sign 20 000 waterfall ticket. They never give us a choice, they just lie we need a guide ,  they NEVER told us the ticket price for the waterfall is 20 000 or you can go by yourself. ONLY that we need to pay 150 000 per person. This is not honest !
Nowhere else on Bali you need a waterfall guide that Comes with you for 150000per person!! Offcourse this is not needed even what they try to explain.

I like to help local community by buying from locals products and food but not from scammers. I dont like this kind of fraude where they give you no choice!

The waterfalls are beautifull the fact that i got scammed ruïned it a little, Nobody likes to be scammed. Visit the beautiful waterfalls but DONT stop at this location! Just drive through and enjoy.

Tourists must help tourists .","This place is amazing.. we’re out of words.. it’s the nature, the activities and definitely the tour guide. He’s so pure and told us everything about the place! Besides this, he’s really pro-active. Is taking stunning pictures / video’s the whole time and packed with golden energy.

I’m bad with names but made a picture with him!

Will recommend HIGHLY to go here. If you have time and like some water fun, please do the water slide!

With the tour you get all the entrances, a guide (which you’ll be glad you took it) and you support the local people! (Win win)"

We planed to stay for one night but decided to stay one more. The surroundings are amazing. The host Satria is awesome. He helped us experience the community and village of Lemukih. People in the village are super friendly and helpsome. We literally didn't know who was working at the guest house because everyone was helping out. The waterfall nearby was really great as well.,"Our stay at Hillside Guest House was incredible. The guest house is placed a little outside the village of Lemukih with the view over a beautiful valley. The nature in the area is breathtaking. The host, Satria, is very friendly and made sure that our stay was unforgettable. Also to be mentioned was the help from all of his friends and people from the village. Make a visit to Hillside Guest house - you won’t regret it :)","Lemukih Village is one of the best places to visit in Bali because of this accommodation. We had a unique experience - windy roads, being close to nature (amazing view and waterfalls), welcoming and friendly staff, home cooked meals, and more!

The room: it is as it is listed on Airbnb. There will be some bugs, but it is part of nature and they don’t live inside the room, so you will do just fine. Towels, sheets, air conditioner is included. There are two rooms in the house, one for the host. Next to the home is an area for the tourist guides/drivers to stay - they are all very helpful and sweet.

The area: there is a Warung (restaurant) with WiFi connection just 5min walk from the room and a few others down the road with motorcycle. The hosts family will cook food for you as well. The WiFi is only good in the morning and come free with the booked room. My boyfriend and I played pool with the neighbors/owners almost every night we stayed there.

The host: is super nice and helpful. Speaks good English so communication won’t be a problem. Other workers will also treat you as their guests so they will offer you food that you may or may not have tried yet (see the photos of food and tour guides)","We had a terrible experience at this place. First of all, the direction to get there was completely wrong. We drove to the north coast, we lost 2 hours.
Then at the room we didn’t have any towels, no toilet paper, no soaps, and the shower was freezing. The bathroom was disgusting with no sink! During the night we heard a rat walking on the roof!!
We booked for 2 nights but decided to leave after the first one.","I was staying here for 2 night to see the sekumpul waterfall. It was amazing staying here, more than what we expected. The owner and his family was friendly and they help us a lot. We see many things that we never see before, culture, nature, its hospitality was one of the best that ever we experienced. We was experinced
The truth hidden paradise of bali with pleasant services here. Hope can see them soon!"
