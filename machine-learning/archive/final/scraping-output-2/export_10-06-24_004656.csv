No doubt, but obviously a local scam to get tourist there by taxi drivers for a kick back. Small “farm”, but over all, good. Coffee and tea samples were amazing. All very sweet, but delicious. Nice and friendly staff, big selection of pricy coffee.
Got to see a very large, pet fruit bat at the end, weird.
If you are into coffee, you have to visit a coffee plantation while in Bali. This place gives you a true Bali experience, no 1st world luxuries here, but you can do a lot worse.","Perhaps I'm being generous with my dating because I, like several other reviewers, was 'encouraged' to go here by my taxi driver. I had a good time though! I was most impressed by my guide who was knowledgeable of the Luwak Coffee process, spoke good English and was enthusiastic. He made the experience enjoyable for me. If I know I'm being set up, I may be able to enjoy it if it's good enough!

I bought a small bag of Avocado Coffee for 170K IDR (which I haven't tried yet to compare with the sample I was given). Overpriced, I know, but it's not much in Western money, is it. I simply refused when he offered me a sample of Luwak Coffee for 50K IDR.

I got to hold a Luwak and, to my initial horror, a great leathery bat and it was awesome! God knows what a bat has to do with coffee but I'm not complaining! There was another Luwak in a cage and that is appalling.

The place is tidy, informative and frankly good fun! It is about a 30 min visit. Honestly, I think if they didn't have a caged Luwak, didn't sweeten their tea and coffee samples and made me feel a little less like I was on a conveyor belt towards their pricey shop, it could be a hit! The guide was honest about the sweetening - just ask him.

Would recommend a visit if you want something a bit different.","First of all, this place is definitely a tourist trap lol. But we still had fun, and I hate coffee. The coffee and tea samples were delicious. All powder as others have said, and probably full of sugar - but hey, it tastes good. Totally overpriced though lol. No harm checking this place out and so what if the driver gets a kick back. That's just how things work around here. Don't go if you're a person fixated on first world norms. Oh, apparently Leo do Caprio came here in 2013 haha",overpriced & staff act too friendly that feels a bit too close for the one that only want to sip their menu.,Such a nice experience to see all the different coffee beans and herbal teas being made. Lovely people running it
