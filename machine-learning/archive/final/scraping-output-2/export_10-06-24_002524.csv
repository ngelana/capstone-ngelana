Large rooms, peaceful area and amazing owner who can even cook delicious pasta.
We will definitely stay there again if we havr the chance to come back to ubud.
Massive thanks to joyful and friendly Agung and her staff.","Delicious food, good service,  friendly and comfortable seating. Very well presented villas.","We spent 1 month in this beautiful place and we are very satisfied.
I recommend to anyone want to be in peaceful and living in a very quite and clean houses.. the place has 3 private ‚Äúapartments ‚Äú which are fully equipped and a shared swimming pool . The owner has a restaurant just behind the villa ( with affordable and delicious food ) so if you‚Äôre lazy to go out you can just ask her ^^ .. I really appreciated spending my time there and there‚Äôs a nice lady who makes the apartment very clean every day . It was a perfect service üëå
Also the owner is a specialist of baking cakes and I very recommend the brownies!! It‚Äôs so delicious. Thank you for this moment and I hope we will meet soon again.","I stayed here during the pandemic, it was my own slice of heaven. It is a homely and quiet place to escape from crowded cities. The rooms are always clean and have enough space with personal bathroom and kitchen. There is a water dispenser in each room which you can ask to refill upon request with additional charge. What makes this place feel right at home is Bu Agung (owner of Kubu Agung), she cooks comforting home cooked meals that are balanced. She also bakes a variety of pastries, bread and desserts. Please try her muffins, absolute delish and fluffy. Bu Agung speaks excellent English and Italian, and is willing to accomodate to your needs. The villa is 15 mins away from central Ubud, and situated in the cool part of pejeng.. so no need to use the air conditioning in the evening. My overall stay was serene and pleasant, I would most definitely recommend you to stay at Kubu Agung if you have the chance.",Owner is extremely friendly and helpful. Beautiful and peaceful environment for a great price. Very spacious room that was fun to stay in. Bring earplugs if the sounds of wildlife will bother you. I would love to stay here again!
