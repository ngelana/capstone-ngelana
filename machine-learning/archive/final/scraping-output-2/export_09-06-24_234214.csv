Walking down into the valley is like a fantasy and as you approach the waterfall it gets even better. The owners are very friendly and offered fruit and some coffee which was very nice.","The waterfall was beautiful!  Our guide Made was super informative and as fit as a mountain goat!  He was very informative and knew lots of inforamtion about the vegetation growing in the area.   To visit the falls you have to go with a guide, there is no other option, but dont let this put you off as it really is worth it.  They take the time to tell you about the surroundings.    The trip back is a little more difficult , expecially in the heat of the day, but it really was worth it.  I highly recomend doing this.",Great waterfall but really dangerous bad road,,
