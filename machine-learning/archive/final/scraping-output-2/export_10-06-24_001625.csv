We had a great time, thanks to him.","Amazing ATV experience! The guides was informative, explain about safety concerns. Highly recommended. Cheers","One of the best Adventure park in Ubud. We choose the atv and rafting package and it was good. The guide are friendly enough to teach us and help us in need, and they are funny with the jokes and everything. The atv track were good enough with some uphill downhill and go thru river, as for the rafting. It was good too, but the river are not really extreem, i mean it probably level 1 or 2 in the rafting standart, but still fun.

Big parking space, more than 20 chang rooms with shower, towel, snack, rice field view. Good good"

It was a peaceful and enjoyable experience since it was away from the town .. Had lots of fun over the pool.. Surrounded by paddy fields, and there were plenty of lizards, snails etc.. Otherwise, the whole place is just a great spot.. Host and staffs were responsive, responsible and helpful as well..","I truly recommend them, very warm welcoming, the staff is very gentle, always smiling, very helpful, very nice hospitality and the service is 5 stars, very loveable, they will help you with everything and it is better to deal with them to rent a bike or transfer, they are trustworthy, they will not scam you and their price is fair. We had amazing 4 days there and it is worth it, they really took care of us regarding all our needs.
The pool is great for photos and bathing with breathtaking view, rooms are cleaned carefully every day, even though there are some geckos, which is normal in Bali and by the jungle, they will come and get rid of it as soon as you tell them, adding to that they spray every day to keep insects and geckos away.
We totally recommend it and we will be back again.","We arrived late at night and not sure the road to hotel, luckily the staff guided us the right way to hotel. Though we arrived late, we were still served welcome drinks. The moment i stepped into our room, i could smell a very nice smell (not sure what smell was that), the room is spacious, romantic and so beautiful. I have one issue with our room, the sink tap water leaking and made the floor wet and we dont like the wet floor. Overall i could give this villa 3.8/5","The villa was perfect. Secluded ,away from the ubud center. Quiet . Clean.
The only cons are the bugs and lizards.","We booked our stay for 2 nights and decided to extend our stay for another 3 nights. When we arrived, we were amazed. The villas are situated in a quiet place surrounded by beautiful nature, 30 minutes away from busy centre in Ubud. If you want to go to the city, you can ask in reception for free shuttle in certain times they offer.There is a pool with beautiful view. Room was clean and the bathroom was stunning! The staff was so KIND, HELPFULL and POLITE. Really service of excellence!  Thank you very much for amazing time here in Ubud!! We will come back for sure. :)"
