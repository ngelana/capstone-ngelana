I personally think it's a good place to enjoy the sunset while having a nice meal and drinks.","What an experience. The music was okay with excellent sound quality, but it never compelled me to bop my head.

The bar had a good variety of choices, but after three drinks, I never had a buzz (?) so I gave up.

The food menu had a good variety of choices, with some vegetarian options.

The staff were welcoming and always willing to make your experience perfect.

The atmosphere was beautiful and I truly enjoyed the pools.

If I go back, it will be for the atmosphere and the beautiful sunset. The bar drinks and the music was a total let down.","One of the best beach clubs to enjoy with an incredible vibe.
The food is fairly good
Order prawn linguine with Basque cheesecake which was good but the cheesecake was pretty firm and sweet and should be cheesy.
Service was alright just a little slow as it was busy. Prices of food were reasonable.
The music was good with a mix of old-school hip-hop and RnB.
Would recommend visiting at night.","Visiting the Sunday market at La Brisa Bali for sightseeing was delightful. The atmosphere was pleasant, the crowd well-organized, and the weather perfect. There‚Äôs a great variety of shops, offering many affordable items compared to regular stores. It's a must-visit if you're in Bali on a Sunday morning.","Superb experience, well worth the investment. Spent 4-5hrs on a Tuesday afternoon in April with friends and kids, had a blast. Food was great, cocktails v.good and top-notch service.

Surfers can be spotted from afar challenging the strong high wave. If you're lucky, you may see some traditional religious ceremony going on, on the colossal reef stone.","One of the best beach in Bali.
Its close enough to Canggu but remote enough to preserves ita ""Bali"" feeling.

Very pet friendly and good blend of locals and tourist.
Phone signal a bit scarce on the beach side, do go near the giant statue at the entrance, you'll get them back.","One of the quieter part of Canggu beach with lots of surfers. The beach not considered as most pretty nor scenic but good place to wind down and enjoy some private moment. If you like sunset, there's a restaurant named Hippie Fish Bali where you can watch sunset at their rooftop with a drink and dinner. Also, you can have a cup of coffee here after surfing or leisure stroll along the beach.","Epic beach with great views for sunset, plenty of places to sit and some small food stalls.

Just a bit annoying you have to pay 2,000 for your bike to enter. Not expensive, just annoying."

Big thank you to the team at Como Canggu for having us.
We were very lucky to be upgraded to one of the residence rooms which are truly beautiful although the more basic rooms are really nice too.
The residence rooms have a beautiful balcony, tv lounge area, huge bathroom and the beds are super comfy.
The staff are so lovely, whether it‚Äôs at breakfast, reception, the pool or even just walking by they will all stop to say hello.
The food is unreal, breakfast was the best loads of healthy and gluten free options available.
The gym is great although top tip avoid staying in a room above the gym.
The pool is massive!! Really well maintained.
Overall the resort is quiet so you will feel like it‚Äôs a little sanctuary vs the craziness outside on the streets.
Thank you team!!
Kim & Matt","Service at hotel is very good, but I felt like the staff at pool area were scared of you not paying your bill. I had left a deposit by reception when you check in and I said to the waiters I would put it on my room, they insisted that the bill be paid. Which is something I never experienced in a pristine hotel before. I must say that Ryoga is super friendly and lovely to chat to  he works by the bar area. A true gem, üòä. Generally the staff is always smiling and welcoming. Location is perfect because the hotel is hidden away and as soon as you walk outside the streets are busy.

The staff at the other hotels we stayed at in Bali were very polite, but here they were truly exceptional. We would also like to thank Danny for arranging the daily tour provided by the hotel. If you come to Bali, we strongly recommend getting in touch with the hotel to contact Danny and take tours to the tourist areas in Bali. He answered all our questions in detail and was really polite. If we had met Danny at the beginning of our vacation, we would have organized tours to other parts of Bali as well...","Definitely recommend. Good and helpful stuff, yummy breakfast, the pool is open until 10 pm (longer than in other hotels), close to nature with beautiful views, available room downstairs with air con for eg. work, bikes available. The beach is also close. However, it's best for surfing, not swimming. The waves are too strong.
It's further away from the centre of Bali, which is actually the best part! No catcalling in the area, very respectful environment, and many cute homeless dogs (not dangerous!).

Definitely recommend.

Restaurant serves nice snacks and a good nasi goreng.,"I spent a week here in the ocean view suite.
My whole experience was fantastic, the room was cleaned daily, I had super sweet view of some jungle and then the beach.
A 2 min walk to La Brisa, 3 minute walk to the beach.
The food and service at the restaurant was great.
The location is out of the hustle and bustle of Canggu, but close enough to walk anywhere or its a $5aud Gojek almost anywhere in Canggu.
There is a mart across the street.
I had a massage at the dayspa and it was one of the best I have ever had!!
Reception were super friendly and helpful regarding booking drivers to / from the airport, it's about $45AUD, which is convenient but a grab / gojek is around half the price."

The location is 5‚Äô from the beach, so if you‚Äôd like to surf, run or enjoy a meal by the sea it‚Äôs a great place to be-plus the sunsets are stunning!

The room was a good side for two people with air conditioning, space to store your bags and tv, hairdryer too upon request.
Our room was opposite a live music sports bar, we actually enjoyed the music and had a few drinks, but if you‚Äôd prefer a quiet one, maybe ask for a room further back, it wasn‚Äôt an issue for us.

There was a swimming pool for chill and cool time! We had a good experience and great value.

Highly recommended!","A really excellent hotel, especially if you choose your room wisely. Very close to the beach. Several great nearby restaurants too. This is a quiet, northern Canggu area so be prepared for lots of walking.

The rooms here are located around three small swimming pools plus a fourth area in a block at the front of the hotel.

Ensure you are located in one of the more expensive pool areas. Each of these has a cluster of nine rooms with three on a second level. The ground level pool access rooms will be more expensive and three of these in each area have an outdoor bathroom. Also more expensive. Highly recommended.

All of the above may not be immediately obvious when using your booking app. The areas are attractively landscaped with native flowering plants and fish ponds. No real street noise. Delightful.

Rooms have a huge TV with HBO. Water pressure is very strong and hot. The daily buffet is good and the overall menu is extensive but you‚Äôll likely want to explore further away.","I have stayed at this hotel numerous times, and each visit only reinforces my love for this place!
The staff here treat me like family, welcoming me with open arms and ensuring my comfort throughout my stay. It truly feels like a home away from home. With all the little intentions they always do.. i'm just like wow everytime :)

The rooms are spacious, very clean, and very comfortable. I appreciate the quiet atmosphere. I've had the chance to experience almost all the room types, and each one has been superb.

The staff are exceptionally kind and attentive, always ready to assist with a smile. The 3 pools  area cute  and cozy! Additionally, the location couldn't be better;  everything is walking distance to the hotel and the beach is at only 5 mins walk! The dream when I wake up early morning for a sunrise surf before work...

Staying here is always a pleasure, and the consistent warmth and exceptional service make this hotel truly amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a genuinely welcoming, comfortable, and enjoyable experience! You will fall in love with it!","We stayed here 2 nights and it was very good. The Hotel is in the middle of a busy street where you can reach a lot of shops, bars, restaurants and the beach by foot. The staff is very friendly and I would stay here again.

The breakfast is quite basic and the coffee tastes like instant coffee.","super lousy music from the bar across the street all night. i actually can‚Äôt believe this hotel allows people to book the rooms facing the street without making some sort of notice about it, it‚Äôs extremely rude especially considering the price isn‚Äôt cheap. when i brought it up to the staff at the counter he brushed it off."

I accidentally dropped an entire plate of pasta on the floor and the staff replaced it, no questions asked. Was very kind of them and I appreciated the high level of service. Definitely check this place out!",Great Italian Fusion Restaurant! One of the better dinners we have had in Bali. They are located right on the beach for a great rooftop sunset. Evening have a live DJ with dining. Food was great! Would highly recommend.,Italian food done right! Simple yet flavorful. Probably the best tiramisu here in Bali. Service was on point. Parking might be difficult for car but i think there's a car park near the beach. It's pretty hot on the first floor as you sit directly Infront of the open kitchen so I prefer sitting on the top floor. Good experience and would definitely recommend ü•∞,"A beautiful street side restaurant with an open kitchen and bar seats by the kitchen counter.

The servers are very knowledgeable, they can explain the menu (which is not your everyday Italian fare) very well.

We ended up following the suggestions and got:
- Tuna Crudo
- Gnocchi Fritti
- White Fish Charcoal
- Maltagliati
- Gelato

The crudo was great, it was a tuna loin, shaped into a circle, and sliced thinly. It was topped with chives, and at the bottom was a really nice dressing.

I really enjoyed the gnocchi fritti, it was a fried crispy and airy dough filled with savoury smoked Mascarpone and topped with ham. It was my favourite of all.

The Maltagliati is a must get! Chewy pasta, great ragu. A lot of meat and very umami tomato base. It's Bolognese on crack.
The fish was also great, fresh, moist and you can definitely smell the charcoal.

We got the Gelato for dessert, it's a combination of Fior di Latte and Blood Orange sorbet.
We were also given the Lemon Semifreddo, their newest dessert. It's lemon custard topped with limoncello granita in a whole lemon. Perfect sweet and sour combination.

Overall, would recommend!","Had dinner at Numero Quattro on Saturday night, the place was pumping with great vibes, DJ playing downstairs. Our food order was fast to arrive at our table, everything was delicious, best Italian food on the island hands down, and the tiramisu was the best we've ever eaten.
I highly recommend Numero Quattro for great food and cocktails, five stars all around. Cheers"

Despite not having made a reservation, after taking a seat at the bar, we got a table pretty quickly.

The service is very friendly and nice that they could arrange this so quickly.

The menu has lots of dishes from pastas to pizza and also Italian starters. I have eaten at many Italian restaurants (and I love visiting Italy), the taste of all the dishes was very similar.

What struck me was the calmness and structure of the kitchen and the beauty.

Enough about the staff and the interior: the food.
We had a bruchetta beforehand and some more Italian starters. All delicious.

Main course pasta with mushrooms and truffle. Also all good.

Dessert lemon meringue cake. Only criticism: the cake was a bit dry.

All in all, I would recommend eating here once.","Jiacamo and the team at Arte were amazing. We ordered nearly 50 pizzas and almost as many salads for a wedding recovery celebration. The food was incredible! Everything fresh and super delicious. All of our guests loved it. They also went way above and beyond to make delivery seamless and smooth!

Thank you so much",We absolutely loved the place. Simple yet very cozy atmosphere and tasty food. The lasagna I got was really good although I tried pizza and the ham was way too salty for my taste,"Had such an enjoyable and relaxing dinner here with my sister, The ambiance of the place is great, it is indeed a lovely restaurant with a nice service warm and cozy. One of the best Italian experiences you can get in Bali. A wonderful experience and value for money. I loved the paintings, their kitchen, and the whole design. The staff was helpful and pleasant throughout, also the live music was cool. Will be back for the Pizza!
Good Luck Arte Canggu

My kids absolutely adore their gnocchi and ice cream, while I can't resist indulging in their mouthwatering baked burrata. Each visit is a culinary treat.What truly sets Arte Pererenan apart is their incredible staff. They are attentive, warm, and always ready to make your dining experience exceptional.

Without a doubt, I highly recommend Arte Pererenan to anyone looking for a fantastic Italian dining experience. It's a gem that we keep coming back to!

Ps: It's better to dine in than order their food on gojek as their quantities reduce due to gojek's charges"

The price is standard but sometimes they offer cheaper price.","While the stalls here are selling similar items to each other, the offering is way better than other areas in canggu e.gBatu Bolong.

As others said - make sure to bargain as the prices can start quite high, but the locals are very friendly and open to negotiation here.

The gardens are stunning, so many gorgeous trees and plants, there are lots of photo opportunities. The room is a little tired in certain areas, mainly the bathroom. Only negative feedback is the staff, they are just unmotivated, not very friendly and you have to ask for everything they don‚Äôt actually give you any proper service.

The only 2 remarks i would give are: there is no fridge and no safe.
Rooms are clean.","No amenties nearby or room service, villa was not maintained and unkept, villa were huge and quiet but serious improvement needed","In February, I booked for 2-nights (Rm# 208) and wasn't disappointed - other than the Sunset View Room didn't get a sunset view due to weather & room location.
But I made the most of the time being there: Seating right outside your room to enjoy your morn brew of kopi and feel the breeze while watching the early bird surfers get magnetized by the oceans waves.
The staff is friendly, considerate, and the place feels safe for single females. The beds were comfy, there is coffee/tea bar in room, towels, wardrobe, work desk, and small but enough bathroom. The only glitch was that we had a window that wouldn't shut all the way and mosquitos unwelcomely invited themselves in.
I do recommend and would plan to revisit AnginSepoi"
