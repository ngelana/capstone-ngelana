Staff is fantastic, so friendly and helpful. The pool has an incredible overview, the drive into the hotel has an awesome rice field, and the rooms are great! Additionally, the food is tasty. I like how the hotel is a little bit separated from the hectic Ubud town center. It‚Äôs an easy moped commute if you choose to not use their shuttle service. Very tranquil,  so much attention to detail, and I am definitely coming back one day. It has been a dream vacation. Thanks, Alila Ubud!","Great environment, very relaxing. However, the staff's work efficiency is poor, and all services take a long time.

1. I stayed in the furthest room, and when I requested an electric car to take me to the lobby upon departure, I waited for 15 minutes but it never arrived, so I ended up walking there myself.

2. I bought two items at the gift shop, but the checkout process took forever. It was just two items, not twenty...

3. At 19:30, I had dinner at Plantation and ordered the Indonesian-style double set meal. The main course didn‚Äôt arrive until 21:00.

All the services made me wait forever.",One of the best hotels we‚Äôve stayed in. From the details at meals to the friendliness of the staff to the stunning location and the curated activities. It‚Äôs absolutely perfect. And the price is unbeatable taking it‚Äôs a top notch resort. We‚Äôve never wasted money and extended a stay but we did for this place and moved our flights back. Absolutely worth it.,"Not really what we were expecting from an Alila. The overall architecture is beautiful and impressive as is the plantations. Even a walk around the front of the rooms via the stone wall with the view is amazing. The pool design is beautiful but was over crowded so you lose the essence captured in the photos. Unfortunately, for a 5 star, the pool villas are a little outdated and run down. The breakfast was extremely appallingly tiny, they say it‚Äôs like a tapas so order a few but, we had to order 3 sets of scrambled each as it seemed to be a single egg in each one. General breakfast selection was appropriate for a 3 star, as some of the B&Bs we stayed during the trip accommodated much more. The yoga session was really not up to par either and set in the gallery which really sounds exciting as it rained but was more a storage room and extremely beginner level. If you‚Äôre looking for more of a luxury adult experience also wouldn‚Äôt recommend it was overcrowded with families at the pool. Nothing against family resorts/hotels or children but really not what was assumed from the overall branding or location of the hotel. A little disappointing to be honest. Sorry Alila crew, service was friendly and excellent but not really a luxury experience.","Time flies! I just had an amazing week at Alila Ubud. This is my second time here and I love the breakfast and morning classes, especially the yoga and qigong. The spa and facial are super relaxing, and the staff is really friendly. They even make my favorite drinks! If you love nature, you have to book this hotel. Oh, and watch out for the clever monkeys during afternoon tea, they‚Äôll eye your cakes! üòÜ Can‚Äòt wait for the next time I come back!"

The service is great, they take photos for the guests during the ATV ride and rafting which you can buy afterwards. Highly recommend you to come here for the terrific experience.","I did the Ayung rafting and ATV rides.  The river was absolutely amazing, the cliffs were 100 + yards above the river.  Note:  there are A LOT of stairs going up and down to the river, not for anyone with physical limitations.  ATV ride was a blast- rode thru the jungle, rice fields, and lots of mud!!","This was a fantastic activity! Our teenagers loved it - the older ones drove by themselves and the 13 y.o on the back.
Awesome tracks, full of mud and water in the jungle and driving through trails in the rice fields.","I could give more stars if I had the option. Staff was very friendly and also patient while on the ride as I was the oldest in the group. Initially I was worried for my 13 year old son, but he enjoyed more than me and gave suggestions on how to tackle the bike in water. This was a real quad bike session with village ride of rice/paddy fields, muddy water almost the tyres were dipped in the muddy water. Slopes up/down, tunnel and at the end donuts üç© in water üíß.  Too good ...Xtreme sports feeling. Loved it.","This ATV and rafting tour was thrilling, and the guides were truly enjoyable. The buffet lunch was delicious, and the toilets were clean. Highly recommended for those planning a vacation in Bali; a must-try activity!"

Worth every cent!",Puri Wulandari is stunning resort. I love being here! Food and view a amazing. People here are so humble and warm! Will worth every penny. The villa is huge with private pool inside villa! Really amazing,Wow! From the moment you turn off the main road you are struck by the beauty of the scenery. The reception area is so welcoming and clean with exceptional views. By far one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. We couldn‚Äôt get enough of the views from every corner of the bungalow and the service was exceptional. We really felt special. Our only negative was the food in the main restaurant at night but we had plenty of options on the centre of Ubud. We absolutely loved our stay here and were sad when it was time to check out! Couldn‚Äôt recommend this jungle gem enough.,"Amazing luxury villa located in the jungle. Perfectly suited to couples. Each villa is huge with large covered outdoor area with lounges. Beautiful bedroom with linen canopy over the bed with 2 accesses onto a deck and outdoor area and your own infinity pool.
The main resort infinity pool area has views of the mountains and  jungle. All the meals were high class restaurant quality with a wide variety of choices.
The villas are so beautiful that it so easy to not leave them all day and just get room service. Probably one of the nicest things about the resort is the friendliness of all of the staff.
In Summary the Puri Wulandari resort is one of the most beautiful, relaxing, healthy places  one could imagine staying at. If you are after a party it may not be your place.","Absolutely beautiful and amazing! The best hotel we‚Äôve ever stayed at. We stayed 6 days and 5 nights for our honeymoon and it was a great experience (I didn‚Äôt want to leave and go to our next hotel!). The views from our villa were breathtaking and we felt like we were transported to another world in the jungle. Swimming in the private pool and watching the sunset as wild birds fly past was so beautiful. The staff are so genuine and lovely and food was great. Our villa was cleaned numerous times throughout the day, we had a butler to assist us 24/7 and there are golf buggies to drive you around the resort and also drivers to take you into the Ubud town. The view and feel of the villa is out of this world and such a hidden gem. We would definitely come back again in the future."

Beautiful room . Excellent service. We arrived at mid night. Person was very helpful, in touch on whatsapp throughout.  Morning breakfast was v v good. Mattress very soft for me. Very good people. Clean, green, equipped. Will come back.","Very remote, not really a farm stay I was expecting to be able to walk around a working farm and learn about how the farm works.  But they said there was a walk to the farm we could go on but it was too slippery because it was the wet season.

It seemed like everything we wanted to do was not offered, we wanted to do a cooking class and they told us they are not are not offering it anymore.  I asked for help to turn on the tv and they told me the tv was broken.

The bed was very comfortable like a 5 star resort.

There are stairs with no railing to get to the toilet that can be a bit tricky or dangerous at night when there is no light.

The outdoor show was great with nice water pressure.

There were no activities except walking the roads through the rice fields which was very nice. And sitting on deck to look at the view.

There were no comfortable chairs only dinning chairs.

Breakfast was simple but very nice, I enjoyed the nasi goreng.

The gardens around the hut was beautiful.

The only way you can get to ubud is to be driven in but on the way back we had to wait on the footpath in the hot sun for 45 minutes in the sun to be picked up. So we only did this once.

We loved waiting for the monkeys to visit us in the afternoons.

I asked the day before if we would be able to buy dinner on our first night and they said yes but when we got there they told us that dinner was  not offered. And we had to work out how to use gojek and get food delivered.  We were pretty much left to work it out for ourselves. I wish they had told us the only meal they offered was breakfast we would have known to bring food with us.

And this place is very remote there is nothing nearby to get food.  2 out of the 4 nights we lost power and it was so hot with air conditioner we could not sleep.

There is a steep dirt road  you need to walk down to get to your accommodation. Cars cannot drive down this road.","The accommodation was wonderful, the room was clean and beautifully decorated, the bathroom was amazingly beautiful and the breakfast was the best we had in Indonesia. Shower was quickly (very) hot and the bed was comfortable. There was potable water available in the room. The jungle sounds and rice field views were beautiful.
Unfortunately, the communication about prices were inconsistent between website, WhatsApp and personal communication. A surprise 10% tax at the end of our stay, we are used to the tax on meals, but not on a room, renting a scooter and pick up service. Note: its about 20 minutes outside of Ubud centre by motorbike/car. Pickup from Ubud centre on the first day was not free.","This place is perfect..stunning and beautiful. In the middle of rice terraces and forest, just 6/7km from the center of Ubud. You have your own big bungalow with open shower, terrace for relax and breakfast. The place offers scooter rental, laundry, massage, tours and more..best thing of all? The people working there are simply fantastic, always kind and available.","The bungalows at Be Bali Hut are very cozy and have everything you need, including beautiful views and sounds of the forest, delicious breakfast, and lovely staff. We stayed four nights while travelling in and around Ubud and we highly recommend it. We also used their laundry services and booked a couple of massages which were the best we had in our stay in Bali."

The location was very well looked after. On the other hand, we had to notice that the food was not at all up to the prices: the appearance and the tastes were okay, but not enough for the price level. We paid around 50 USD per person, for a menu that we expected to consist of several courses, but we got an appetiser, a platter to share and an average dessert. The price was grossly disproportionate for the place and type of food: in Italy you can have excellent complete menus for 40 USD and superior quality and here we are in a country where you can find fried bananas (even better ones) for less than a dollar in warungs. I would probably pay the same price for the same quality only in Switzerland.","Friendliest and best service we had during our one week in Bali!!! The staff are super attentive remembering all guests names and preferences and take real pride in their work....
Chef Ayan and the team doing amazing food and even happy to do some off the menu requests too!!

There is a 200 metres walk to the villas but the team will help with the luggage. Hoping to come back here soon.","It's rare you find a place that just has everything. Excellent rooms, bathrooms, living space and kitchen. View is just spectacular, the pool is warm and inviting. We had both the downstairs and upstairs areas and both were great. Even though the location and facilities were outstanding they didn't even come close to the amazing hospitality of our hosts Made and Putu! They could not do enough for us. Cooked amazing meals, organised tours, organised scooters and shuttled us to and from Ubud centre. Would gladly come back and will be recommending to all my friends.","The place seems like it's newly renovated, everything was new and clean and the staff was so helpful and kind, we even got free durian one time cz we're lucky, breakfast was superb, we had vegetarian Nasi goreng and banana pancakes with fresh fruits and ginger tea with honey. The bath was super cool with a jungle view, and a dressing table and work desk. Was one of the most amazing and cleanest villas I've stayed at, with the best service."

We stayed here during our anniversary and she made it so memorable we will never forget.

You will feel like you are a part of the nature and staying here will definitely purify your soul. Yes it is a little far from ubud but it‚Äôs so worth it because you have everything you need here. Eni is an amazing cook her fried rice was out of this world. Her husband Nyomann is a tour guide and has a super comfortable and clean Toyota to take you to wherever you need to go. He also gave me a tour on his scooter and took me to local places and Introduced me to the real Balinese life and culture I felt like Anthony Bourdain I was so happy, felt eternal bliss with tears and I have never felt like that in any places in the world. They also have massages on demand by Enis sister in law- who worked at a high end Japanese massage place and I think she was also the masseuse for the king of ubud- she came to our villa and provide the best massage I have ever had in my life- make sure you experience it while you are here. Eni‚Äôs brother-in-law is a traditional Balinese silversmith and you can watch him make silver jewelry by hand everytime you pass the courtyard. It was so fascinating and beautiful you can purchase some from him if you want to, he can handcraft it for you on the spot. There‚Äôs also a small local store ran by a friendly and honest villager lady for your last minute needs such as water, drinks or cup noodles if you wanted something quick. An American lady, who is now our friend, loved it so much here and she rented the villa next door for 25 years and she is super friendly and fun. But will definitely leave you alone if you prefer complete privacy. You will be so lucky to stay here, they have become my Balinese family and I cannot wait to see them again.",Beautiful and relaxing villa in the peaceful outskirts of Ubud - can't wait to stay here again!
