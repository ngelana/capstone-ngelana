These fields are really spectacular.

I stayed in villa Cendrawasih with rice field view. A comfortable, clean, but outdated room; fairly modern bathroom though.

The location, although beautiful, is quite isolated for me. You will have to arrange transportation in a timely manner. The well-known taxi services do not operate in this area.

Hospitality
Friendly and helpful staff. That must be said.  Hospitality is in good hands.
The restaurant has a simple menu, but the quality of the food is very good. Unfortunately, smoking is permitted in the outdoor restaurant.

I can imagine that you, in company or group, will find your stay here very pleasant. The location is very suitable if you want to undertake trekking, walking or cycling activities.

WiFi: good to know
During my stay, the WiFi connection was unstable but mostly non-existent in my villa.
The connection was only good around the restaurant and the swimming pool. This made it impossible to work in the cloud in my villa. I therefore shortened my stay here from 5 to 2 nights unfortunately.
A repair carried out did not improve this. Your E-Sim has only a poor LTE network here. Be aware of that. I don't know what the quality of the WiFi signal is at the other villas. Hopefully the staff will realize a more permanent solution. For example, install more routers or WiFi boosters.
I think they will.

Been coming back many times n always enjoy the atmosphere. Warm n friendly staff. Not luxury but rooms is clean n comfortable. Truly Balinese feeling. Thank you Cempaka Belimbing villas.","Beautiful resort. The right choice if you want  to spend some quality time with your family or your love one. The place is nice, weather is cool with the breathtaking landview of paddyfield. The foods at the restaurant must be made better. But if you want to look for only holiday is this place the right one.",Hidden resort with high quality of service. Traditional ornaments on the building. Fresh air and nature ambient will guide you for quality of relaxation. A place to rejuvenate your mind and soul.,Nice place 'away from it all' nice for a day or two. Friendly staff nice view and area. I can recommend the cycling trip! Massages are average but very cheap.

I only stopped to take photos but I was welcomed by the the owners, invited inside and had a lovely conversation with them. They showed me around suggested a few place to visit in local area. After touring around I didn't hesitate to come back a few hours later to have the most amazing nasi goreng with absolutely stunning views.
I didn't stay at the villa but I had a look around and if I can say one thing. If you're romantic type and want to treat your lady to a romantic getaway this is the place to be. It's a traditional Balinese villa (I didn't take photos) and would highly recommend.
Thank you for your hospitality and delicious food and coffee. All the best. Warm regards",incredible views and the unique atmosphere of an old Balinese house. very quiet and picturesque place. very friendly and attentive staff. the owners Agung and Ketut are simply incredible people. We surrounded you with care and attention from the moment we arrived and made our stay extremely pleasant and unforgettable. Thanks a lot. I'll come again.,I was seeking a different Bali experience and found this treasure on AirBnB. Gracias hosts who picked me up and dropped me off at the airport (note- it‚Äôs about 2 hours drive). You‚Äôre in a pristine part of the island with sweeping views of the mountain across terraced rice paddies. I felt like home and the food was sensational,Really love it here. The villa is located in the middle of rice fields. You can witness the sunrise and sunset in one place here. Lovely ‚ù§,"very cool place. is a restaurant and a one room villa in middle of a fantastic rice field. food is very good and portions large (multiple sambals and fish dishes in addition to other staples). owners kind and fun to talk to but not overbearing. villa is very interesting. plenty of parking. not sure where to book the villa; either traveloka or abnb perhaps, or contact directly."

You have to wait for quite a while. So come here but not too hungry yet, for at least half an hour. During busy time, might be longer.
Situated on the cliff, so the view is superb. Parking lot is quite spacious.",The view is not really nice like i expected. The portion of food is very small. The chairs not very comfortable.,"Stopped for lunch on a weekday.
There weren't any other customers and there were 4 staff that I could count..

Service was really slow üò±
Had to order some drinks twice because they forgot üò±
Food really average and expensive üò±

Would I come back again ü§î
No nothing special here","...strategic location at main road Pupuan/Singaraja - Bajera, this is the perfect place to stop over and also enjoy the lunch while seeing the beautiful scenery. The food is good, and the taste is yummylicous. The owner and staffs are very kind and friendly. A perfect place to ""rest"" after long driving.....","Nice place with an amazing view. Local food and local prices, the non-tourist menu offers a better selection of food which was delicious"
