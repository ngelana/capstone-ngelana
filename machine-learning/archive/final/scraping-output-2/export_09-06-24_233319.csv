The mix starter platter is a delightful assortment of appetizers, each offering a unique taste that prepares your palate for the main course üíô

The ambiance is cozy and inviting, complemented by friendly and attentive service.  It's a must visit restaurant for romantic dinner in Amed",The absolute yummiest best meal we had in Bali. We had the chicken satay is so unique - home spices and cooked to perfection. We also had the curry thigh chicken - sooo good. We had the jackfruit nuggets for starters and that was a culinary surprise - tastes like fried chicken! The house doggies and the kittens were adorable - part of the service package! Thank you for being around Galanga! Don‚Äôt miss out on this restaurant.,"First time coming to this resto cos they mentioned Belayag, a dish originally from Karangasem area. I am sure it is tailored a bit to foreign visitors palette but overall still authentic.

Tried their starter platter as well and the corn fritter was a star. Gyoza can be improved as the dough is too thick.

Cocktails can be made stronger I think.

Homemade Ice cream was quite a highlight. It has a nice milky taste although it is a bit too sweet. I tried lemongrass ice cream and coconut ones.","""‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Our 3rd anniversary celebration at Restaurant Galanga was truly magical! üéâ The staff went above and beyond, surprising us with a stunning flower mandala that spelled out 'Happy 3 year Anniversary.

The rooms where clean. The villas were set up with a decent pool and lounge. The food the served was very tasty. The one thing for improvrment would be that, if you use the plates/glasses etc or ordered at the villa, it would be nice to have a place to keep the dirty dishes or a little washing machine or something. Or maybe I should have just messaged them the moment I wanted it to have it picked up - but it was unclear for me, resulting in me doing dishes (which is ok) with limited means (which is annoying).

Other than that, I would return here for another stay!","I really wanted to give it one star, but that‚Äôs going too far. Rooms are just off the charts. Private pool etc. No need to harp on how good they are. However, are the workers on work experience? Is anybody over the age of 21? I had a nightmare checking in (no need to bore you with the details). No emotional maturity from staff to make a decision. NOBODY at reception so you have to run back and forwards to the restaurant to get somebody. A great place to stay, just soured by incompetent staff, which probably isn‚Äôt their fault. They‚Äôre just young.","We loved our stay at Villa Adi! The photos don't do it justice. The restaurant is also great, loved our nasi goreng every morning. Easy to hire a scooter from the villa for 80k ($8 Aud) a day and the roads in Amed are a lot quieter than the rest of Bali. You can also get a lift from the villa to certain spots if needed also, we did walk one day to the beach as well but scooter is easier  :)) highly recommended! Thank you","The setting for these villas is absolutely serene and beautiful. Perfectly kept gardens surrounding gorgeous bungalows. We stayed in one of the bungalows with a private pool, which was very clean and absolutely lovely!","We had a private villa all to ourselves and it was great. The pool was clean, and the rooms as well. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They also rent out scooters and have a laundry service (by kilo!). A great place to stay in Amed.
It was a little far from the center of Amed but not to bad by scooter."

My friend got her food before me and when she was almost finish until I got my food. They were almost to quick to take away our plates.

Food Excellent.. aircon cold

Also, don't get the ham and cheese toastie for breakfast. They charge 85k which is the price of a gourmet meal but is the saddest breakfast ever. It's just toasted bread that's gone cold and a plastic slice of cheese. There wasn't even any ham. And they call it the Harmony 'Special'.","My stay here was good.

We had our own private pool which was just a lovely. Rooms with very clean. We had extremely firm beds, which we weren't used to but other than that everything was great.","The first time I came to Amed, I stayed in their Bulan villa with a pool shared with 2 other rooms only. Marvelous villa!

This December I came back and stayed in their biggest villa with 2 bedrooms and a private pool. It was still excellent, but I would prefer the Bulan villa more even thogh it had one bedroom only.

The staff were super-friendly and promptly attended to any complaints. The establishment itself is a large garden area that had walkways leading to each villa. So many trees, shrubs et al. Just amazing. I definitely recommend this place if planning to stay in Amed.","It's a nice place, and the staff was very sweet. The place isn't central, so you might need to rent a scooter.

Cheaper than in other places
Fast service
Beautiful decorations
They have a pool also, spot for pictures, rooms downstairs and view!

Very romantic place :)","Nice place with a really beautiful sunview view. However, prices are without taxes and the only reason for that is to fool the customers. At least, I felt mislead. On top of that, a 10% service charge was added automatically to the bill. In my opinion unacceptable. It is up to the customer to decide if the service is satisfactory or not and not up to the establishment. Will not come back for this reason.","I am speachless with this place, restaurant, villa and pool with amazing view, feel like in the heaven, specially when sunset goes down.

The shared kitchen has everything you need to cook for a long stay, and there are lovely staff that come every day to clean the house. For me the location was perfect - hidden away with lots of greenery but close enough to shops and the ocean‚Ä¶my room had an incredible view of the mountains behind (see the attached photo)!

The only downsides for me was there weren‚Äôt any comfy chairs for working - I work remotely full time so my back was pretty sore after a month. Other guests bought office chairs online because of this but would be great if they were a feature. Occasionally the Wifi was patchy but this wasn‚Äôt the fault of the property. I bought a modem which I could use as a backup.

I would definitely come back again‚Ä¶already looking at future dates :)
I saw the price for the house at the top went up a lot while I was there, so I‚Äôm hoping the prices don‚Äôt go up too much, because right now the value for money at the place is really good!","I enjoyed my stay in Bonsai House, the host and staffs are amazing! Definitely staying there the next time I visit Amed :)","Bonsai house is an amazing Airbnb to stay, wonderful staff and host.",New accommodation. Lovely home with a nice pool. The staff are friendly and helpful.

I had the best BBQ chicken so far in Bali ‚ù§Ô∏è
Fairy lights at night makes place nice and day view is also great.
I am just sorry that I came here at the end of our time in Amed.","The view is fantastic and finally I found the crispy duck,  which was so delicisious.  There could be better advertisement in the street, definetely mention the crispy duck today.  Now it seemed people do not found this as well they should.","We had a good dinner here. We were seated upstairs.  The ambiance is nice. The staff was super friendly. The food was good overall and it well priced.  Had the chicken curry and not duck, which is what it is known for though.  They did run out of seafood tonight.   It was cash only.",Went there for dinner and the place was very festive with colorful lanterns on the open air second floor dining area.  Friendly staff. I ordered the chicken curry and it was awesome.  Also tried their Arak with honey and lemon - it was delicious. Be sure to stir it well because the honey settles at the bottom of the glass.,"The food was ok, the mie ayam was cold not even warm.
The staff very friendly, and the place also nice"

Soto Ayam was fantastic",Lalapan Ayam Delicious.. The Only Halal Food Stall in Amed,"OK, let's not compare them with Galanga accross the street as they are in another category but this is your budget to-go local warung where you can not go wrong. Just a few dishes as most warungs but a solid choice with some soto/soups, nasi goreng and ofcourse their sate ayam (chicken satey). All halal.","Very local, simple, good little warung. Excellent quality/price ratio. One of the best nasi goreng we ate !"

These unit are in different area than others rooms. 1 unit contains 1 bedroom with 1 big bed and 2 twin bed with kitchen and bathroom. And the next door unit contain of 2 bedroom with 2 big bed, with kitchen and bathroom. So it was more than what we needs, but a little difficult to watch my kids since they move one to another rooms. We are staying with 3 adult and 4 small kids.
The kitchen is pretty large with refrigerator and stove. We stayed here for 2 night and very good to have kitchen to cook for kids. There are mini mart in the front of the bungalow that sell fruit, meat, bread, and vegetables too.
Indomart also very close to the property.
The internet is not working so we can't use their Wifi at all. The water in one bathroom also not working once we came, but they fixed it fast. The room clealines is excellent. The towel need to be improved since some towel already old and the colors looks dirty. There are a big hole in the batroom mat. We are luck to bring our own toiletries. They only provide few small bar soap and toilet tissue. There are no basic toiletries at all, there are no liquid soap, shampoo, tissue etc. The food in the restaurant is decent. There are a road and pedisterian walk construction in Amed area so it might get crowded on your way to reach this property. The location is great, close to the beach. We did snorkling and swim with a fish. The pool is big but something wrong with their chemical. Too much chemical and wrong ph. Ww know it right away after get in the pool. They need to pay attention with their pool maintenance. My kids love swimming and the pool water is not good. Overall our stay here is great and I totally recommend this bungalow.","This was the best indonesian food I had in bali, hands down. I came here three times and was really really really good. BUT, the carbonara that my girlfriend had was literally scrambled eggs with pasta. Disgusting. Even I (and I‚Äôm not fussy) could not bring myself to have more than one bite. But look, 5 star review because is it really their fault? They‚Äôre not Italian.  So stick to the stuff they know how to cook, and you‚Äôll be a happy camper!",Had a lovely week staying at Pazzo Bali. The owner was very lovely and checked in with me to see if I was comfortable and happy with my room. It's lovely and peaceful there as just a little bit out of the town. Amed is quite spread out so best to have motorbike rental if you not in the central part. I enjoyed being a little bit away from the the main area though. There's a lovely swimming pool too that I had to myself most days. The rooms come with a small kitchen too with cooking facilities which was very helpful as I like to prepare some of my own meals. There is also a shop and atm right across the street. I would definitely stay here again.,"The room is big and spacious. I took a room with 2 queen size beds fit for 4 people. The best part is the shower pressure! Amazing shower pressure and hot water all the way.  The bed could be better but it wasn't that bad either. The kitchen is fully functioning and crockery and utensils are provided. There is even a fridge. Breakfasts are very basic and not that good. The best part is just the fresh cut fruits. The service is very basic then again you don't really need anything from them. In front of the hotel there is a shop where you can get all your groceries there. So you can skip the breakfast deal and cook if that's your thing. There is a pool but it's not well maintained... As for amenities please bring your own soap, shampoo, toothpaste and brush things like that you know... they don't provide. They do provide towels. The room's cleanliness is ok. The towels aren't maintained there are some holes.
Overall it is a good place and you can easily correct the faults if you bring your own bath needs and towel. They provide hangers anyway. As for price it depends on the eye of the beholder.",I stayed 2 months at Pazzo in Bungalow 2. I really loved it ! My bungalow was really big. And I had a seperate kitchen and a nice balcony with view on Palm trees. The pool is great. The staff is super nice !! And there is a bar and restaurant. If you feel too lazy to move they can bring the food to the bungalow so you can eat at home : ) location is also perfect in front of a big shop. And close to restaurants.
