ChIJQQrhbjUX0i0ReTctOJsyMLo,Taman Sari Waterfall & Natural pool,-8.5023087,115.328281,"Jl. Ngenjung Sari, Bakbakan, Kec. Gianyar, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80515, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=13416278932180514681,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3831-0808,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.7,1117,,"One of the best natural pools and waterfalls I've been to! The nature is absolutely stunning, and the water is cool and refreshing. It's also quite shallow so you can stand. There are lockers for rent for 10K and a bathroom and fresh water showers. Entrance fee is 20K. Highly recommend!","Nice and quiet waterfall just off the road. Parking was free but there is a 20k IDR/person entrance fee. It’s about 100-150meters from the entrance fee, mostly downhill. Going down isn’t to bad, but for a 50 year 2 pack a day smoker, it hurt a little but. There is an overview picture spot and then down to the water. There is a change room and the water was nice and cool in the mid days heat.","Taman Sari Waterfall near Gianyar, close to Ubud, is a serene spot worth exploring. The natural pool and waterfall are beautiful, offering a tranquil retreat. It's easy to access, with just a short 5-minute walk down, and the entry fee of 15k is reasonable. If you're looking for a peaceful getaway amidst nature, Taman Sari Waterfall is a must-visit. Good parking large","I visited Taman Sari Waterfall whilst exploring the waterfalls around Ubud and the surrounding areas. Out of all the waterfalls I saw whilst in Ubud, Taman Sari was definitely my favourite.

We visited around 10am and it was very quiet - we had the whole place to ourselves. It’s very well looked after, with clear and easy routes to follow to safely navigate down to the waterfall.

The waterfall is impressive, with various formations coming from the main waterfall, creating several natural pools. We didn’t swim whilst we were there but it did look inviting. There were some great photo spots whilst you’re visiting so you can capture the moment.

In my opinion this was the nicest waterfall we visited whilst in Ubud. There is a small fee to pay but it felt well looked after, so it was well worth supporting this a beautiful space.","The Energy of Lush Jungle with Pure Waterfall is Healing

This is much less commercialized or touristy than Tegenungan, although smaller in size here you can get directly under the waterfall.

It’s very slippery and rocky, my Keen shoes with enclosed toe were the best to help. As you walk down the steps there is a small Temple which has water with koi fish and an offering alter. A beautiful reminder of the Balinese faith to the importance of nature.

I felt a purification energy here and looking up at all the lush green while you are in the water a sense of AWE is deep. There are ledges in the rock formations by the smaller waterfalls that are great for meditation.

If you need to change clothes or use toilet do it in the waterfall entrance area not where you park. The toilet behind parking area is very small for clothing change, it’s outdoors so expect bugs and rather than criticize it, go home grateful if yours is more updated. I’ll never complain because this country is a special place. This info just FYI :)

I highly recommend visiting here and taking it slow ~ peace."

I had the chicken satay which was so tasty. I also had a fresh papaya fruit juice which was so refreshing! It is all so well priced as well! Would definitely recommend stopping here if you’re seeing any of the waterfalls nearby! It only took us 20 minutes to walk from Tibumana waterfall. The atmosphere is also lovely, overlooking a rice field with gorgeous tables, which are all in the shade! The couple who own this are so friendly and welcoming! We received complimentary cake and local fruit to try, and you can get bananas off the tree when they are ripe! Would 100% recommend this place to anyone! Gorgeous setting, with delicious food and drinks!!","You HAVE to go here for lunch. The couple who run the restaurant are so lovely and speak amazing English. The food is gorgeous and the views are OUTSTANDING. Feels like a proper family run, very beautiful place to eat. They also use leaves and bananas from their garden to cook your food. Will 100% be going back.","Best warung we have been to yet! Amazing service and the food was incredible. All made fresh and a lot of homegrown ingredients, we saw her pick the chilli's fresh and we even got some papaya at the end as the fruit tree was in season. If you're in the area, you must stop by!",If you would like to go to more calm waterfalls and see local villages this area is perfect! The lady who owns the place cooks amazing and she is super lovely! A very cute and cozy place looking towards the rice fields. You can go for a lunch in between your waterfall hopping or go for diner with a beautiful sunset! All the food is also local and traditional Balinese cusine :),"Such a nice place for lunch or dinner!! Lovely atmosphere with a good view. Really friendly host, she gave us complimentary cake and fruit, and even taught us some Indonesian! Would recommend the chicken satay."
