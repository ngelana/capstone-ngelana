It's a resto with swimming pool and billiard table included. Pricing is very nice, and the overall atmosphere is comfortable. The place is suitable for all ages, it has even kids playground! The swimming pool is also not too deep for kids, maybe you can take your kid swimming in this resto of which is located in a usually hot and dry condition in the noon, which is perfect! As for dishes and beverages, I reommend to try the Nasi Genyol (Rice+Pork+Lawar+Vegetables) and the Milo Ice.",Suitable place for hanging out and to have community meeting especially for Tourism Group in Tabanan.
