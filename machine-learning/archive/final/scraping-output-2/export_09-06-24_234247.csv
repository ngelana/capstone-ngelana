Before we entered there were a bunch of people that want to sell you food for the spirit  and ornaments THAT ARE NOT NEEDED but they will lie to you saying that you must have it, luckily our guide saved us from this scam.","Best temple to go if you're mad with architecture and sculpture. The temple is very different design wise compared to other temple in Bali. Wonderful views from above and very nice weather. As always, wear your adat clothing and do be respectful since this is a place of worship.","This is a the oldest temple in Bali, you find 3 temples one close to the other and the roof of them are high, so is not like other temples, in Ubud. You pay like 5 dollars entrance, includes a guide who takes you pictures (give him a tip).",Part of the Besakih Temple complex. Beautiful old spiritual place with stunning  views of southern and eastern Bali. We were very lucky to have sunshine and crystal clear air. The details on Gunyng Agung were exceptional.,"Be careful if you're offered to go inside the temple. You are going to be involved in the small ceremony with praying to hindu gods. Organized like a show that requires you to make a money offering, and you'll be told that recommended offering is 7 dollars each person. And on top of that another tip for the show which should be higher than at least 2 dollars. If you give them less money, they act very unsatisfied and humiliated.
Architecture is pretty interesting too see, and the views are great. Just make sure you don't get involved in tourist trap activities.y going inside the temple."
