If you like waterfalls, you will love it, however, I would say that diving is only for the brave! It is worth a visit!","An absolute hidden gem. We stumbled across this waterfall by chance and went in with low expectations. However, we couldnt have been more wrong. It's a stunning place. Yes the waterfalls might not be as big and impressive as the others, but it's a super peaceful setting and very quiet. Recommended donation of 10k IDR at the entrance (honesty box).","It was a beautiful complex of waterfalls however it was closed during Covid 19 means that there was no maintenance for  a year.

We came there based on google map but then we were not sure where the waterfalls were as there was no any signs. We just parked the car and asked a local person. He said we just need to walk from the parking. So we went down and turn left and turn right. We saw a gazebo that used for the entrance but at that time they said the waterfall was closed since a year ago. (There was a house in front of the gazebo).

As we already spent time to reach the location, we continued the trip to the waterfalls. We still could walk although the paths were not easy as it used to be. There were several small waterfalls. The trekking path was not that demanding in terms of the stairs.

I gave 4 stars because of the lack of maintenance and access toward the waterfalls.","Really nice medium sized waterfall accessed by quite a scenic route through a jungle and around the side of a deep gorge. Path has been improved by flowers and carvings in the stone walls. If you continue on the path beyond the waterfall site, after about 50 meters there is a nice vista across the chasm at the little temple above a stream on the other side. Temple is accessible by the wooden bridge but at the time of our visit its insides were still under construction.","It is named by the locals as Dedari Waterfall

Its not grande kind of waterfall just a small size single waterfall

Its weekend noon and nobody was there

Ticket price is for donation only 10k

The route down had been refurbished"

So many beautiful scenery all along the way. After covid still free entrance. Steep stairs but well placed so no problem for trekking. Tips : try to go deep down into the river to see amazing views!,"You love waterfall ??

Very great n green, please come here for traveling","swimmable waterfall, quite long way down. but worth it :)","Lovely waterfall..
Worth the trip to see and plunge into the waterfall","Path to the river and waterfalls is very neat, cool place to see but you should know that you wonâ€™t be able to swim there. Wild and no crowds of people, so we were absolutely alone there."
