The architecture of complex is beautiful, employees are extremely responsive, friendly and helpful.

I‚Äôm glad I stayed at this place and will surely return here. It‚Äôs super quite, clean, free of noise.

At night you can enjoy sounds of nature, despite the fact that sound isolation is just perfect.

Cafe located on the territory of complex is great, coffee is good and I enjoyed every single moment being here. Highly suggest !!! 10 ‚≠êÔ∏è / 10 ‚≠êÔ∏è","First hotel where I were wakened up by the cleaning staff 3 times in a row at 9am and several times later. Despite my pledge for them to give me time to sleep and do not come to clean the room earlier than 3pm. Overall nice rooms and good lighting. Also, the most expensive laundry I've seen in Bali. Restaurant is nice but not cheap.  Pool is nice! Room is good for romantic trip.","Elevated living. Period. This place had amazing rooms with a huge bathtub. Everything about it was comfortable. It‚Äôs right next to a rice patty farm which makes it that much more aesthetic and the quarters of the hotel are beautifully decorated with plants and well trimmed trees. The food also hit different here. Everything is fresh and is made in house. We had breakfast and lunch here and did not regret it.

Staff was also friendly. The only downside was the location of the hotel. It‚Äôs a bit removed but beautiful nonetheless to go for a walk.","First time staying at The Saren in Tabanan, Bali. Its offer a serene atmosphere, perfect for those seeking tranquility and a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life. The absence of TVs enhances the focus on relaxation and provides guests with a true zen experience. It sounds like an ideal retreat for anyone looking to unwind and find inner peace amidst Bali's natural beauty.","We had our stay here for 3 nights, together with my partner here at The Saren and we were left disappointed. The cleanliness of the room was appalling - dirty cups, dead bugs. The overall hygiene standards were far below what we expected, making our experience a little uncomfortable.

Though we did not request for any clean up room service, the staffs would just randomly come in without notice. Not only that, it felt unsettling when one of the staff entered the room while I was in the restroom without any notice beforehand. The clean up room service also felt disorganized as they left our belongings on dirty surfaces.

Overall, we had no issue with the service, the restaurant staffs were lovely. The housekeeping needs more improvement. Location was a little far from the central but would be great for people who wants a peaceful stay."

The food was delicious, tasty nasi goreng and the caramel pandan latte was perfect, don‚Äôt forget the pie because homemade pie always wins - be patient when you wait for the food especially when the place is packed but honestly I were pleased with it because the view and the weather so nice also don‚Äôt forget the beautiful sunsets at Kabunku.

Ice americano is bad, I can taste the beans aren‚Äôt fresh, makes the coffee tasted weird in the stomach and dull, and no, it‚Äôs not because the Robusta vs. Arabika taste. It‚Äôs just weird possibly due to storing the beans incorrectly.

Other than that, the staff is friendly, space is quite clean and the chicken popcorn tasted better than the nasi goreng."

Curiously i tried it today around 4 pm while the satay supply still available and try to share my take on this pork satay stall.

1st of all, the pork satay set. It's very straightforward, 8 sticks of satay and "" ketupat "" for Rp. 10.000 (less than US$ 1). That is a bargain. The taste, the satay is savoury and sweet. Shame the maker can't really serve tender satay, but for me still okay. Even if what i got is straight 2 blocks of lard, it's still taste damn good, tender, smoky, almost melt in your mouth. It also use sambal as the sauce, and it's not spicy sauce too, still enjoyable.
Actually, 8 sticks doesn't fill me up, so i ordered another portion, but just the satay and he gave me 11 sticks. Nice!

Next, the place. It located right before the bridge with white metal, under some tree, across the some soto ayam place.
Have to say it is place in side of a road, so you have to be creative for parking stuff.
Another down side of this stall, it's not that clean too.
Hygiene problems is why i don't give 5 *.

Well i guess it's kinda given for less than a dollar food.

Anyway, 6.5 / 10 . Good for snacking!","Good, simple and cheap. We went after dark, he almost closing for the day. So location is pretty dark.",The Bestüëç,
