Tampaksiring, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80552, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=15678890203990880158,OPERATIONAL,,museum,"museum, tourist_attraction",4.6,432,,"I recently visited the Sukarno Center Bali and was blown away by the rich history and culture that I experienced. The center is beautifully designed and maintained. It was fascinating to learn about the life and legacy of Indonesia's first president, Sukarno, and to see the various artifacts and memorabilia that were on display. but the exhibits were poorly organized and lacked adequate descriptions, making it difficult to understand the historical significance of the items on display. Some of the artifacts were also in poor condition, which was disappointing to see.

Pak Enong were knowledgeable and welcoming, and I left the center feeling inspired and enriched.

Overall, I highly recommend the Sukarno Center Bali to anyone visiting Bali. Whether you're interested in history, culture, or just looking for an interesting and unique experience, this center is definitely worth a visit. I can't wait to come back and explore even more!",Nice place to see and knowledge about the first presiden of Indonesian..,the place we know all about our 1st president..full of historical items and photos. if really like history you should come,Good place to understand more of the first president of Indonesia. This museum is desicated to him. If you are in the neigborhood do give it a visit.,"Love this museum. They have this cool collection, with artifacts, painting, books, etc. Drop a visit when youâ€™re nearby."

Food is only average and prices on the high side for Bali average.,Food was ok. If the chicken sticks would be warm it woukdwould have been nicer. Credit Card didnt work but we could pay with USD which Was really nice. Price is higher than in many other places and the food was not good enough for the Price. Once but not twice going there.,"The food was all right, but the prices were way too high, and (at least so he told us) he didn't have even 15K change. We suspect they just wanted an additional tip on top of the quite expensive meal where service should already be included.
The view was quite nice though.","We've been here after our cycling down the Batur trip. The food was ok, the choice was enough to pick something favourite and the view was great.",Beautiful place with a serene environment. Great service. Food is pretty good. They accept credit cards.  my friends and I were pretty satisfied.
