My partner and I only stayed for one night but experienced a lot. We were welcomed by the hosts Gede and Putu (husband and wife), who also helped us organise a sunset tour up Mount Batur. That was an amazing experience. It was only about a 5 minute drive to the starting point. The room was beautifully presented and very cozy. For breakfast, we had omelettes made by Putu. They were delicious! We had a great experience at Samsara Desa, and would definitely recommend staying there if you are planning to hike up Mount Batur.","The owners (husband and wife) are very friendly. They made banana fritter and tea when I arrived and it was very delicious. I never had a banana fritter like that, i believe she made it with her heart that made it taste good. I did not bring motorcycle, but the owner lent me motorcycle to buy food. The room and bathroom is clean and spacious for me. Very recommended","My girlfriend and I had a fantastic time staying with Gede and Putu looking after us. They were absolutely wonderful and some of the kindest people we have ever met. Beautiful rooms, great location and if Putu will sell you meals, definitely get them! Absolutely delicious food.","Being in Putu and Sibuk's home was incredible and healing. When I arrived in Kintamani there was no hotel yet, my intuition took me to Sansara Desa, the energy of this place is magical, surrounded by mountains and the volcano. Putu cooked delicious dishes for me at a very affordable price, I was able to learn how she cooks Nasi Goreng. I wanted to see the thousands of bats near the region, which my friend had shared with me, Putu promptly drove me there on his scooter. Sibuk was super helpful in making sure everything was ok, and in telling me about his culture. I had a better time with your son, and I was able to experience everyday life in Bali, beyond the tourism sold by marketing. The room is super comfortable and 100% worth the price they ask. I highly recommend it.","The most amazing homestay on Bali! The bed is so comfortable, the room and bathroom are realy clean and Putu and her husband are so kind and helpfull. The breakfast is really good and the coffe/tea is for you during All day for free. Thank you again for an amazing stay here!"

Roosters starting well before dawn and then loud traffic all morning. The owners seemed nice. I only stayed one night. Hadn't realized when I booked that I'd be sharing a bathroom maybe I just missed that somewhere. The breakfast was interesting bananas & watermelon and little gelatinous rice balls with coconut milk. Way too much plastic wrapping tho. The room itself is plain and simple.

The price they offered to do the sunrise hike was way cheaper than a guide I met who offered me a private tour for 600k (not sure why I'd want to pay that and walk a mountain solo with just the guide. Way rather be with a group)","Nice place, paradise among other buildings in the village. Very friendly people, the guide to volcano works at the hotel, she is very helpful and communicative!!! The room was clean. We shared the bathroom with other neighbors so the floor was wet most of the time and you might not have hot water. Breakfasts were delicious.","This place is amazing. Owners of homestay are very nice and helpful. Breakfast and dinner were perfect. I really love this place and if I come to Bali again, for sure, i will visit them again. We took a tour to the mountains from their friend King and it was perfect.","Beautiful place to stay in a quiet village. The hosts are some of the sweetest people I ever met, they provide free coffee and tea at any time, breakfast, and a variety of tours such as sunrise hiking or fishing. The atmosphere at the homestay is perfect for relaxing. I would definitely stay here again if I was in the area","We stay in Songan place 2 nights, Higlhy recommends this home stay. We felt more than welcome. The food, fried rice and fish were amazing, in fair prices. Breakfast are included in the price, and are delicious. Areal is clean and tide.
They organised for us trekking on the Batur Mountain (beautiful), and also driver who took us back to Despantar.
Thank you very much. See you next time."

The hosts made me feel like home. They're very friendly and treat you as a family member. They can speak English fluently so we found common language easily. They are very helpful as well. My room was perfect. The village is very nice and the house is very close to the Batur lake. The scenery is just fantastic. I definitely recommend this guesthouse to every traveller.,"I had a very authentic Bali experience staying at Tegal Suci Guest House in Songan Village. Ketut & staff made me feel at home and enjoy my stay in Songan Village. So peaceful and beautiful staying close to Lake Batur, Bali's largest lake & surrounded on both sides of the lake by Mount Batur & Mount Abang. Ketut can organise activities like cycling & trekking & climbing Mount Batur. As I am not very fit we did not climb Mount Batur but instead we climbed the crater rim for sunrise and I enjoyed very much going to the Batur Natural Hot Springs. If you like a place where there are less tourists, is more peaceful and very beautiful place in Bali then I recommend a stay at the friendly Tegal Suci Guest House in Songan Village.","it's a good house, with 3 rooms & 1 sharing bathroom. mbok komang & bapak ketut are really nice to their guests. want to go to a nice sunrise spot? ask the owner, he will take you to best spot nearby.","the location was perfect. If you're looking for somewhere local to stay, this is the perfect place for you. The room was very clean and spacious. The hosts were super nice and friendly too.","Tegal Suci Guesthouse very nice house and quite place, i stayed 2 nights with my family, the host Jess and Komang is very nice persons, they are both very good english,
