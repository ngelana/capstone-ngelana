The hotel is lovely with great service and atmosphere. The diving experience was wonderful.  The Dive Masters were knowledge and friendly and the waters around here teeming with life. Safety was very high on the list and the equipment was in excellent condition. If you aren't diving I would still recommend OK Divers as it is in a great location for the ferry, the small harbour area and several restaurants.","I did a refresher course with OK Divers which was really great. I hadn‚Äôt dived for over 10 years but my instructor Arya made me feel really safe and comfortable. The equipment was all really good quality and the swimming pool was perfect for going over the basics. I only had time to do one dive, the site was close to Padangbai and we saw lots of coral and fish. Really enjoyed my experience and made me feel excited to do more diving on my trip.","The location is perfect for launching to the Gili Islands. Staff were incredibly helpful. The rooms were great. And the food was fantastic.

We returned here for lunch when our boat came back from Gili Air. Was a great option to avoid the taxi decision until the crowds thinned out. They helped book the taxi for us.

Would definitely stay again","Went diving with the OK divers team for 5 days and absolutely loved the experience. Super dive sites, amazing team, great equipment and delicious food! Would 100% recommend diving with them if you‚Äôre in Bali.

Thank you to the entire team, especially Putu & Aria for the wonderful experience!","Excellent hotel staff and dive team. I am AoW and had 4 different dive masters during the stay. My girlfriend was a first time diver and they took great care of her for two dives.
Wide variety of dive sites, highlight was the manta dive, expert guides helped us find them and take awesome footage. High quality, safety, and responsibility.
Hotel has a lovely communal vibe, best from our holiday across Bali.
Definitely rate the whole crew and would recommend, especially for newer divers."

Cons: rooms/ toilet needs more maintenance and cleaning. There are better hotels around the area for the price I got.","Checked in for one night before heading to Gili T.

The photos online have the rooms pictured with an AC unit. It seems that some rooms may have AC but there‚Äôs no way to request it, and when we got to our room there was only a fan.

It was hotter in our room than outside, and even at night time was significantly warmer in the room than outside.

We asked for an extra fan to put one closer to the bed than the wall mounted one across the room, and they had none they could lend us.

The main reason for a mediocre review is at this price point you can absolutely find an air conditioned room easily.

I can‚Äôt stress enough how hot the room is, you‚Äôll drip sweat just by laying still in bed.","Cheap place, but you might need to check the room before you check in.

If you are hungry give it a try, for IDK 35K you have a very nice plate of chicken, rice and roasted onions in front of the sea.","I have eaten here a few times and I can highly recommend ordering the grilled fish It's cooked to perfection with crisp charry texture on one side and yet the fish is still juicy and moist. Really amazing value for the price compared to nearby eateries.

I believe that we need to limit eating fish, and when I do, it better be at place that does it well and make it worth it. This is one of those place."

Lovely spot to relax, not too busy. People snorkelling said they spotted a few turtles. Had the grilled prawns and the veggies with peanut sauce. The chips were freshly made. All what we ate was delicious. Sun beds can also be rented along the beach; prices varied from 25K to 40K per person.",Great food! Whole grilled barracuda is amazing! Highly recommend!,"My Happy Place, especially on Sundays, because of less traffic.
This small cozy Warung is at the amazing  beach, best place for relaxing, cold drinks and most times offering fresh fish, which can be cooked or grilled as you wish!

A hidden gem in Bali üôè",Super fresh fruit! And the BEST Nasi Campur I ate in Bali!,"Cozy family restaurant. Good price (better than other restaurants), tasty food and big portions!"

They always charge you extra for everything and don‚Äôt follow the price in the menu.
The food is not good.
The ham and bread were not in a good condition.
Definitely the worst experience I had in Bali","We ordered a breakfast but unfortunately the staff could not understand properly
The staff didn‚Äôt follow what what was on the menu and tried to charger a different price.
First he charger the  triple cost of the coffee, the pancake came without icecream (was included in the description), so was necessary ro complain. Unfortunately i felt frustrate becsuse of this situattion but it is what it is, the price and desciptuon have to folow the menu and do not be given another price after eat.  I did not expected this in bali.  My suggestion for everyone double check the price and be clear what you are ordering",Best food we ate at the Padang Bai area! The bbq fish is amazing en the view is very nice!,"Super pricy maybe thought im foreigner that speak bahasa?
Taste average...
Cost me 90k + drink","Good taste, seafood and Indonesian standards. cheap price nice hosts, fresh fish, real Bali family atmosphere, salt of the earth... errr... sea, management. One of the original Padangbai places."
