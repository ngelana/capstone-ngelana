You have plenty of space to do yoga, dance, do whatever.
There’s a rooftop to hang out in the evenings and enjoy sunsets (or sunrises) with a great view onto the local rice fields!
The rooms are bright and nice, too.
Well equipped with bathroom and AC.
The kitchen is functional and we enjoyed preparing our own meals when we didn’t feel like eating out.
After all, it’s conveniently located and you can explore once you have a scooter!
I definitely recommend the place :)","Wonderful and peaceful stay

The property has a wide space, brilliant and quite new. There are nice kitchen, free water and hot water all days on the ground floor.

Room is basic but clean and very comfortable with big bed. You can take a hot shower and air conditioner is strong and cold. There is good WiFi too.

The owner is so helpful and welcoming! They response quickly if you ask something.

Location is quiet and peaceful. You can see the beautiful rice field from the room. So it's the best place if you want to chill in Bali!","We loved our stay in this beautiful place!
The house is super spacious, bright and located in a lovely, calm neighborhood.
The room is comfy and equipped with everything one needs. A big window allows you to look outside onto beautiful rice fields and if you feel like it you get an even better view from the roof top! An amazing place to relax in the evenings.
There’s a well equipped kitchen where we cooked our breakfasts!
We had an amazing time! We highly recommend it!","I went to this place today and surprisingly it's so close to everywhere! There was Bali zoo and bird park like 10 mins away, a mall, close to city center and 30mins from Ubud. The view was amazing! Lots of rice fields and the room was so cozy and clean!

I'd recommend a long stay in this place! It's so affordable with all the facilities!",Very Good
