Parking is limited
There is a drive-thru
If you are to going there is a 2000 IDR fee

They have a double Big Mac, double patty cheeseburger, match green tea mcflurry.
Also serve fried chicken here.

Very clean
The staff do a personal drop off/delivery to take in customers.","I am mad at myself for how much I enjoyed this McDonald's. I didn't want to have Western food while in Bali, but I fell to temptation and set out to the Golden Arches for what I thought would be a traditional McDonald's experience. Though this McDonald's looked and felt like a standard McDonald's, the selection of food here was so distinctly Indonesian that the whole experience was hilariously among my favourite memories of Bali.

Much of the menu revolves around fried chicken, and the spicy fried chicken I had was, without exaggeration, among the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life! The drink menu was equally entertaining, with options like Iced Milo all the way to extremely elaborate and immensely delicious iced coffees - I had the Iced Coffee Brown Sugar Float, and it was among the tastiest iced coffees I've ever had as well. The spicy chicken bites were also delicious. The fries are standard, but the ketchup is a unique Indonesian variety that tastes a bit like ketchup combined with chili sauce - it, too, was fantastic.

Food here is technically a bit more expensive than at the nearby traditional Balinese restaurants, but if you want a small taste of home (they still have several usual suspects, like the Big Mac and beef burgers if you really want to be reminded of home) as well as a hilariously enjoyable experience, a meal here is truly inexplicably fun and memorable.","Great selection of food and meals, very clean and very kind staff","What the heck, it was McDonald's - Indonesian style!  We did the drive thru.  I think the food is really good to be fast food and the kids were happy (so was the wife).

It's a favorite when we are in a hurry, in and out quick - more friendly than most any fast food place.  ... a chicken nugget is a chicken nugget.",Was so surprised with the variety of items they had. It was so nice. Loved the taste. It is very cheap comparing to the other food places in Bali. Mango custard pie was awesome. A definite that you should try.

We ordered a pizza and the staff just said no for things. We asked for oregano that was on our food, and they said we don't have it.
The drink in happy hour was just a glass.
Food was standard but crust that we wanted was not available when we went there so we had to compromise on our order.",Nice location. I’m vegetarian and thankfully they did have a vegetarian pizza option and it tasted nice. There’s ample parking space around.,"Very bad service and long waiting time, we asked for the Pizza at 7:30pm to take away but they don’t have the dough available and staff was not friendly. After choosing Pizza it took them 30mins to cook, way more than the quoted time. Pizza hut should improve their services specially on this outlet.","Visited on May 20, 2024, for dinner. The place was clean with a cozy atmosphere. Staff were friendly and prompt.

When we asked to pay later because we needed to pick up money first (didn't have a scooter yet) the atmosphere already got weird. They never asked to clean our room or bring toilet paper. When we asked to extend the room they couldn't give us a better price (we wanted to stay for almost 3 weeks). They are really money focused  and for this price you can get better accomodations.,The hotel is small but cosy. The pool was really nice and the staff was friendly. The only thing was that the shower wasn't the best and it is a bit far. but besides that it's a great value for money.,"It's a cheap stay, but that's all the value you'll get. I dare say most of the 5 star reviews here are lying right through their teeth as Dream@Jimbaran runs a clever marketing scheme (feels more like a scam at this point) of giving out freebies in exchange for 5 star reviews that their staff vets before they are posted.

1. The room is shoddily maintained with rust even on their fabric blinds.

2. The air-conditioning unit is old and barely cold, even at 16 degrees.

3. The shower's pressure or rather lack of was incredibly frustrating after a long and hot sweaty day out.

4. There's no hairdryer available on the premises. [EDIT] I checked with the staff at the reception and via phone call on 2 separate occasions, only for them to tell me they don't provide hairdryers at all.

5. It's located in a very closed off section of town with barely lit and narrow pathways that fit only one car at a time, so walking at night is a clearly dangerous idea. (Note earlier review where someone was attacked outside here.)

Just take your money elsewhere for a place that actually has integrity when it comes to receiving honest reviews.",I had a great stay. The staff was very friendly and the price was great. I stayed a month and made good friends with the staff who work here. They helped me rent a scooter and gave me great recommendations for places to go and things to see. A great place to stay if you like local food and culture.,"Disgusting!! We arrive late at 10pm, first the kid take the passport and went to other room instead of being in the reception, of course I follow him and he took a lot of pics of the passport....

Then we went to the room and for my surprise on the sit toilet were sports of urine!!! Yellow and smell bad...they didn't even bother to clean the bathroom!
Also a lot of hair!
I call and tell the kid (yeap we were received   for 2 teenagers..) to look the bathroom, so he went away to find something to clean
But for my surprise he arrived with only TOILET PAPER and that's it!!! He want to clean the sit toilet only with toilet paper and nothing else!!!

Don't bother, you will find better places"

It provides a wide variety of flavors and types of bread, cakes and pastries. Although several convenience stores such as Circle K and Indomaret try to offer various kinds of bakery from their production lines, they are still far behind in terms of quality and taste.","Holland Bakery is always a safe call if you need pastry stuff.

I asking about or they know about place to get caffe or breakfast in area, they don’t know anything and the most irritating that I leave the store with no nice attitude.

The salad was super spicy so I couldn't eat as much as I wanted but it does say spicy on the menu so no complaints I just kept trying to eat it between mouthfuls of Pho.
Great value and lovely staff. Lots of customers when we were in. Very popular. Would recommend!!!","Prices have nearly doubled, but the portions have shrunk. Now it's 100k for a king-size pho, which I normally order to have 2 meals. The last time I ordered it came half empty. Pictuted is the total volume, including the noodles, what a joke. I've ordered it takeaway many times, and the container is almost full. I've tried to order the braised pork leg at least a half a dozen times, and they never have it even though now it's on their regular menu.","First time trying Vietnamese and Thai food and it was amazing! I tried Pho Bo (Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup) in regular size. The beef broth was tasty and as you can see, the herbs are super fresh! The portion of each dish itself was big, so if you want to try other food, you can just order one portion and then share it.

We also tried Thai Papaya Salad and it was super refreshing. The dried shrimps made it even umami. I hope we got a little bit more peanut 🤭. Definetely will come again to try other menu. BTW, I saw in the menu the salad seemed spicy. I don't like spicy, but the waiter said we can decide the level of spiciness or in other menu, they serve the chili in a separate plate. So it is safe for someone who doesn't enjoy spicy.

*🐖 contain (non-halal)
* parking lot is quite tricky if you bring car, but the resto itself is spacious. Available indoor & outdoor","Finally, I can come to here for my lunch.
Their food is good.
If possible, I want to request peanuts sauce for fresh spring roll and wrap it bit tighten.

I hope they will keep this quality:)

Click helpful to encourage me to share more reviews 👇","You order your coffee and food downstairs. The staff are friendly. They will give you a buzzer and you can choose to wait downstairs or you go upstairs and pick your seat first until the buzzer beeps. There are few choices of seats. It's quite comfortable. The problem is if there are groups and they can be quite noisy. So, if you want to work, bring your airpods or headsets!
For other guests, please mind other people around you!

The staff doesn't say anything about self service, but I kinda feel it is self service. Upstairs there's a table with different sauces for food, tissues, and even a cloth with cleaning spray. So we did clean the table ourselves. But many people just leave their trash and leftovers on their table. So my suggestion is if it's self service, put a sign somewhere or explain it when we order. It really helps!

They have new menu that's not yet up on their sign: french fries, onion rings, and pisang goreng","I swung by for a fast lunch and was amazed by how tasty the food was. The staff were super friendly and welcoming, which made the visit even more enjoyable. Plus, their co-working area is really awesome!",Compact and comfy spot to have a coffee in Jimbaran!
