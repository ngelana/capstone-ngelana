All the food tasted delicious and good reasonable prices, not jacked up tourist prices. My husband really enjoyed the popular traditional dish Mujair nyat nyat and the pangsit rebus was so yummy. You also get an amazing view to look at while you eat","Amazing. Simply amazing. Firstly, it’s halal. Secondly, it’s as authentic as it gets and thirdly, the lady who runs this place is a beautiful soul. I came here for lunch which she catered to me and then drove around Kintamani. I had planned to go back for a dinner and had a small bike accident on the way (the roads are SUPER steep and bendy, stay in first gear) and when I got there for dinner she gave me ice for my wrist and healing oil. But the friend rice and chicken katsu were also very healing! Thank you for everything. Top place. It’s where the locals eat so it’s where you should want to eat too.","Amazing spot,
I really recommend this restaurant.
Anna is really nice, and her cook is awesome, in a generous quantity, cheap with a magic view.
Stop looking for the best restaurant around, you found it.","Nice place with a beautiful scenery, the food is delicioua and the price is affordable..","Local food, made with much care and a wonderful view. Lelyanna , the owner and great cook, speaks good English, has traveled a lot and loves food. I recommend the fried bananas. She even made it with corn flour for wheat intolerants.Enjoy"
