You have to be carefully as there is just a rope on the cliff as a barricade. The view is astonishing.,"It's a nice place for having lunch when you come to visit Angel's Billabong and Broken beach.
It's a running place and is always occupied with tourists so food mostly is fresh and so found safer to eat here..
They have a lot of space inside and then few small shacks sort around to sit and eat.
They can make and modify fried rice and few other dishes to vegetarian dishes which was good.. taste wise I found it good..
They also provide fresh coconut water.. they have ice tea and drinks option too
Staff was friendly
They have a small swing with sea in the background for clicking photographs.
Overall good place to eat","Hungry after swim at angel billabong and just grab food in this warung. Personally i don’t expect much but the food is yummy, nasi goreng was good idea, and the pasta is not bad. Banana split come with huge portion. Overall so satisfied with their food and service.","This place has a nice ambience and the special chicken fried noodles (mie goreng) is definitely a must-try. The chicken satay is also coated with peanut sauce, which is a unique taste that should not be missed.",Because of Chinese tourist groups on lunch time. Stuff doesn’t care about you at all. As long as there is Chinese tourist groups they don’t simply give you a menu! Waiters just sitting and sipping their juice. Since they done serving them.

So this review is specifically for Warung Geprek and not for anything else.

My husband and I dropped by randomly at this warung and ordered the Ayam Geprek with Sambal Geprek Bawang, a double mie goreng + add on 2 fried eggs, and 2 large coconuts.

The food was prepared quickly (we were prepared for a half hour wait which seems to be the norm in Indonesia warungs, so this came as a pleasant surprise). The Ayam Geprek was a large piece of freshly fried, crispy chicken topped with a delicious sambal, and came with rice and a slice of tomato and cucumber. The mie goreng came with the two extra fried eggs, and my husband also asked for extra sambal which was made on the spot for an extra 3k. Both were delicious! The chicken was tasty, crispy and was a large portion of the price (25k, if I remember correctly). Husband loved the mie goreng. The coconuts were delicious too, and the lady  kindly split them in half for us so we could get to the coconut flesh. Total bill was 105k.

We were too hungry so we don't have any pics of the food haha, but we did stop to take pics of the place before we left. It is the first warung on the left once you go past the square arch heading towards angels billabong/broken beach.

To note: quite a few flies, and no running water in the toilet.","Really good food but we felt we were overcharged for three plates of lalapan, a coke and an orange juice.

We paid about 160k initially which we felt was overpriced but we were in for a surprise when the owner stopped when we were returning back from Angel Billabong and asked us for 20k more saying that she made a calculation mistake.

The menu she had did not have a price and it's a lesson learnt not to dine anywhere where there is no price mentioned on the menu.",,,

We are enjoy so much...",Very expensive food here. They will provide a menu with photos and the food is no where near to what you see in the photo. There were few other people who came to the hotel at the time we were there and they were given a different menu. Don't go. There are many other good places around there to have lunch or dinner,Food was okj for the prices. Nothing special we had there something like light lunch.,
