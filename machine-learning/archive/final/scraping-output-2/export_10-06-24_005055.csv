Good vibes. Definitely go up to the hill where there is another temple and a great view.,"The area is popular for black sand beach. When we're going there, it is mid day and very hot.","Well cleaned area and proper parking area, cons there are no seller nearby and some of the fancy lighting are turned off.
So its better to keep it on in the night so the people will feel more distictive to come and visit.","Once you arrived in the beach, you will be surprised with the clear sea as well you can see your shadow on it. I enjoyed spending my time by sitting in front of the beach. It is so relaxing where you can see the bright sky and the beautiful island in front of you. Well guys, the water is cold and realxing. I love it so much.
This beach has the black sand and many small stones along the beach line. The waves is high enough where you have to be careful when you want to swim there.
Around the beach, you can see some place where it sells coconut water and the local foods. Even, you can find ""Pure"" such as Pure Gowa Lawa and much more around the beach.
But, some locations near the beach is dirty where i can find the rubbish. It can be the notices for the local guides to make it cleaner so it can increase the visitors. ‚ò∫"
