This is the most my Favourite village. located in Tabanan Regency takes 40 minutes from mengwi bus station by motobike. They keeps undiscover natural beauty such as river,rice terrace, hills etc. Although the natural culture is interesting, the Balinese culture is also still thick such as some traditional houses, dances, dances and also temple architecture which is still maintained originality. You can find some sacred dances such as calonarang which are quite adrenaline-pumping, but sacred dances like this are usually carried out on certain days. You can also see how the process of making knives and kitchen furniture is made traditionally by forging and heating in embers. There are several spots where you can see the sea and also the GWK statue there. Some locals advise me to go tracking in the afternoon because you can also see the sunset on the hill besides that some terracing looks like a Teletubies hill which is very stunning to your eyes. Dragonflies and butterflies are also quite common because they also keep the air fresh. Some activities such as cycling also feel fun, you only need to rent it for 340k for 1 tour package with a bike. We can also do meditation and also gymnastics with the surrounding community, they usually do it in a building called wantilan. They also offered us to try dancing Balinese dance. You can also feel bathing in a pancoran or river in this village. It perfectly describes a quiet and peaceful village. In this village you can buy some traditional foods such as bubuh and also mixed rice and they also offer some souvenirs such as knives made by the craftsmen directly. They are open daily from 8-8pm. For free entrance tickets but you have to try the tour package because it is very worth it starting from 150k rupiah / pax. For facilities they provide public toilets and also a large parking lot and also selfie services.","It' still in development but you can see the place is great. Very natural, clean air, near river, a good place for escaping city crowd","I had some time to kill after Tanah Lot. Saw this place on Google Maps and thought I'd drop in. It's pretty weird, not really a tourist attraction. This person showed me around for like fifteen minutes. They have temples you can't go in and some houses you can see from the outside. Bikes for rent but I can't work out what for

Not worth coming - avoid","Small authentic Balinese village. Quiet, clean, natural with lush green, traditional.",the best village experience in bali
