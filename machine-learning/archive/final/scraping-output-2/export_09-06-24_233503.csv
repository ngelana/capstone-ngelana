Baturiti, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82191, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17535618263502062285,OPERATIONAL,+62 857-3814-1745,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.2,1186,,"What a wonderful hot water spot! The drive there is beautiful with mountain scenery. We parked up and walked through a magical forest on a moss covered trail before we descended the steps to this perfect little oasis. They have two larger pools, both around 25C°. One is next to a waterfall, which makes it like a fairytale. There are warmer, 35 C° private pools covered with huts and a hot dip pool that is around 40C°.","The place is very beautiful and shady.  The hot water is really natural, there are 2 outdoor swimming pools and several rooms with small pools for relaxing.  The new parking lot is very large but the way to get in and out only fits one and a half car widths so you need to be careful.  highly recommended for people who want to experience a good vacation with the natural hot springs and tranquility of the nature that surounding them.",Really nice hot springs - well maintained and friendly staff.  Had a private bath which was very soothing and just a great all round experience.,It was very nice here. We tried out both larger pools the shallower as well as the deeper pool by the waterfall. We also tried out the warmer outdoor pool. They are all very nice! We enjoyed our time here for about and hour before a thunderstorm rolled in and even then there are covered places to hide from the storms. We paid 45k per person. I feel the rate could be lower as it was off season their food stands and such are all closed but overall we would still come back it feels like a fairly tale as you walk around the steaming pools next to the waterfall and river.,"Can't believe how nice it was. Except the smoking part. The staffs smoke non stop. It was no escape. It's like a Bar vibe where it has non stop smoking surrounding your hot springs experience. I could not relax because I'm getting 2nd hand smoke constantly. The only pool worth seeing is the waterfall one but the water is cold. The small room is where everybody smokes at, so even though the water is hot. You can't relax either. You're second hand smoking constantly. I think staffs should not smoke there. They smoke on site and in the springs pool. They should go to another private area for smoking. It's mainly them smoking at the pathway and in front of springs both, not tourists. Because only 2-3 tourists there during my visit. Over the duration, tourists come and go. Very few of them. Small place so."
