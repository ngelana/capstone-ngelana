Good spot for you who love to do a spiritual journey in Bali, or for you who  just visit to enjoy the view and take some pictures.","The tree tunnels is an interesting sight. But the view from the area is amazing, to one site is the coast with white breaking waves and on another is dense forest without much villages. Wow! That perhaps is what Bali looked like long time ago.","Beautiful Tree, cheap and delicious food from the Warung, friendly people, love it üå≥ ‚ù§Ô∏è","If you love trees, you will love this spectacular tree üå≥ ‚ù§Ô∏è","Amazing tree passage! Stop there when travelling from South to North Bali (or any way really), it‚Äôs a lovely place to take a break. Driving there is a pleasure, really beautiful road though the villages."

There was a smart tv in the room even. The wifi was good. Thank you for hosting us!

I will be honest, if you are afraid of big spiders, this place might not be for you. Since it is in the jungle, unwanted guests are not uncommon. We had a huge one in the bathroom at 10pm. The owner immediately came and cleaned it, but as someone who is deadly afraid of spiders, I didn‚Äôt sleep well. Of course it‚Äôs in the jungle, so it is normal, it‚Äôs just a heads up.",Was a really nice place with the most beautiful view! The owner was very helpful and helped us with going to our next destination. Would definitely recommend to sleep here.,4 stars for the view.  Nasi Goreng was sweet and the egg was dry.  Asian pop music was too loud especially at 9am in the morning.,"Located on 430 meters altitude, it provides a beautiful view and a small house for accommodation. Outstanding tidy, clean, and a very cozy bed. very good value-for-money, highly recommend!","Best for chiling, fresh air and good view ‚ù§Ô∏è"
