* The idea of a bamboo house is nice, the designer did a good job.
* Sleeping in the sounds of nature for a short period of time can be nice.
* We could pay by card.

Cons:
The place is expensive at 2.8 millions rupees per night, I consider it a scam for the below reasons:

* The rooms are open to air, the ground floor one doesn’t have two walls and it only has curtains. This means you can’t escape humidity and any potential heat ever.
* We asked for a ventilator downstairs and we were told that the owner policy is to only give one for the upstairs room and the downstairs room is open anyway and we shouldn’t feel hot. During the night when we closed the curtains the air became hot and stuffy. I apologise to her highness Stinginess for not being able to sleep with the curtains open because all the jungle bugs could come in and I wasn’t comfortable with that.
* Even the upstairs ventilator was very weak and didn’t really do much.
* The place is DIRTY. We slept the first night on bed sheets that stank! I covered my pillow with my towel because it was too smelly to sleep on it as was. I didn’t dare to raise the duvet higher than my knees because I didn’t want it close to my nose. When we asked them to clean and replace them they told us the owner doesn’t allow to clean more often than every two days. I don’t think they had changed them between the previous guests and us.
* The textile around the beds and the drapes and curtains haven’t been washed in years and were dirty and stained. The duvet on top of the net upstairs was filthy as well.
* The river behind the villa is loud and the room having no walls means you can’t ever escape the noise and the humidity. You cannot get any respite, it’s just non stop noise.
* Because of the humidity, our clothes have not dried for 4 days. Again, I would have liked to have one room where you can get comfortable temperatures and humidity levels but...
* Because of the humidity your hair also never dries. They provide a hair dryer but it’s probably the cheapest there is and it takes a forever. The owner is a real cheapskate.
* The kitchen they use is absolutely filthy.
* The breakfast and the rest of the meals were absolutely stinky and disgusting and apart from the fried rice we couldn’t eat anything else. The eggs literally stank and we couldn’t go near them without vomiting. The pancakes they offer are mega disgusting too. I lived on rice for 3 days.
* For the meals we ordered we were charged 20% extra for employees salaries and another 2% for using a bank card to pay. But the employees were so incompetent that they couldn’t cook an edible breakfast, we already paid for meals we couldn’t eat.
* We ordered some massages and the they were ok but the sheets they used to cover the sun beds and us were filthy dirty and stinky. They covered our eyes with a towel that was smelly too and I had to move it far from my nose because I couldn’t bear the stench.
* When we left it was impossible to get a rider on Grab and we had to use their driver. A ride on Grab was 350k but they charged us 500k (negotiated from 550k) because they knew no one else would be available to drive us. He was extremely annoying and the whole ride of 2 hours was so unpleasant! He was in hurry to get back home to go to a wedding and he drove like a maniac, we barely managed to stop once so the kid could use the toilet but she was also hungry and we didn’t dare to ask him to make a short stop at the supermarket. We all arrived at our hotel with a headache. He frantically honked everyone on the way and he whined non-stop about how he will be late to the wedding, how we got a really good price for the ride, how his boss will only give him 100k, how there are too many traffic lights and will delay him, how we let them know on a too short notice that we needed a ride, etc. We feared he will get too upset and maybe drop us on the way, instead of him being nice because we were his paying customers. The cherry on top was when he asked for a tip. 😂 Dude… are you delusional?!","The design of the villa is nice BUT everything inside was dirty and smelly: curtains, bed sheets,  pillows, drapes, rugs.Food was very bad. Employees can't speak proper English. All this nonsense for more than NZD200 per night!!!",We visited on the month of April it was very Preety that time and Greener that time some time it rains so we found some frogs and insects. It’s a totally bamboo villa so you might found small insect and mosquitos in villa bt that is so normal in any bamboo villa tha situation might b same. We also saw a big lizard we asked the host about it he said it was not harmful. The villa doesn’t have its own cafe or restaurant bt they do have menu if you ordered from that they deliver you on your room the place is quiet from hustle and bustle of city. If your are in search of peace and relaxation definitely go to. I liked everything about this place the upstairs bed with a view of river the open shower and cute Little pool facing the river just hoping if pool would b bigger it will b cool bt it’s fine. After checking out we moved to Nusa penida from there we asked for taxi from host they were Preety expensive so be prepare for that or as we booked a taxi from Grab bt we had to waited for so long may b for an Hour. We tried atleast 3 to 5 time to find taxi on grab and we didn’t find it bt at last we got it and we are very happy we did go from Grab bcoz the prize of both are very different bt if you are in hurry then book a cab from host it might b fast and convenient.,"Haven’t stayed there, but if you want to know the price quickly like me: €950 pn","What a unique place! We had two nights booked at Eco Bamboo Island, a 2-bedroom home made entirely of bamboo. Upon arrival we were greeted by the friendly host and staff, and taken for a quick tour around the house: Pool, outdoor shower, hammock, round bed, and sleeping net over the pool.

The open layout beautifully you to nature, with a small river down the steps from the home.

A good selection of breakfast choices was included in our stay, and there are choices for dinners and drinks at an additional, affordable price.

The location is good, although you truly are in the countryside of Bali.

Overall, staying here was an unforgettable experience, and we loved it so much that we extended our stay for a third night. Highly recommend!"
