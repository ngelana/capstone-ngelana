I think it was the owner, helped me get the scooter out of the ditch, went and got his daughter to help me while he took several of his guests to the ferry.  His daughter put antibacterial ointment on my wounds, and made me feel much better.   I can attest that these are good people and I know they will make your stay wonderful.  I highly recommend.
Craig robnik",The best hotel on the island in a beautiful and quiet location. The owner was very friendly and introduce us to his eagle Dedo. We also had the chance to attend the karaoke night. The rooms are beautiful and the restaurant too. You will see a good collection of bird,"The place is great and peaceful to stay with no noise and have access to everywhere from the middle. The food is good. The owner and service is great, they went out of their way to help us and send their staff to get us ferry ticket on a busy weekend and much more. Very friendly and warm people.","The place is dark, bugs, no service of any kind. Probably the cottage I stayed was so. Moved to other hotel after a day.","the place is comfortable and clean, the owner is very friendly and very helpful!"

I have to say that it is such a nice surrounding, gorgeous view, and the staff were so nice and friendly! The food was so good and they followed my ‚Äúno spicy‚Äù instructions haha. Amazing hospitality and I would definitely come back üòçü´∂üèª",The ambience n place is pretty good. We ordered the seafood fried noodles which was salty n dry/uncooked with barely any veggies or seafood. My partner had the soupy ayam bowl and it tasted majorly of soy sauce. He just had the shredded chicken n left the rest. The owner n staff seem nice. Maybe the non Balinese food tasted better cos our meal was very disappointing.,"Absolutely beautiful place. I really loved the birds and the amazing view. I only had a drink, so I don't know much about the food. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!","We had amazing time in this restaurant, owners were amazing, showed our kids their animals, birds and pets, food was really good and the whole setting on the beautiful Island was just great! Would love to come again!","We were here due to package, The food is very very bad.
Just tomato ketchup in noodle and rice with zero taste and portion size is 2 3 spoons max.
Kindly avoid"
