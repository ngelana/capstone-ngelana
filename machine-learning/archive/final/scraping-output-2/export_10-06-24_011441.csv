In short words feel short to express, everything was just ü§© perfect

If you are looking for the best unforgettable experience this is the place.Make sure to book ocean view room atleast a month before.","My husband booked this for our first anniversary and trust me it‚Äôs a great experience. We payed extra and their staff pick us from the port . It was about 40 minutes away by car.
The staff were all very friendly and helpful and no request for assistance was a problem for them. If you want to see the nature closely visit this property and you will experience the beauty . We would definitely stay there again.","An unforgettable escape! The tropical glamping site offered breathtaking views and cozy tent, an experience that was magical, with an incredibly attentive and friendly staff. Very close to dimond and atuh beach, where they gave us scooter to go. In terms of food their seafood noodles were the best. Highly recommended if you want a break and unwind by staring at the ocean‚Ä¶only one issue I would say are the ghekos that come in the night‚Ä¶but rest was great üëç","Too Overpriced and Artificially Inflated by Influencers
Not worth 600AUD + Cleaning fee.
The owners are extremely rude and try to rip you off every chance they get.

There are similar options nearby with better amenities.

I dont think it is the right fit for anybody who wants to have a decent stay.

Also check the rude response from the owner and decide if they really deserve your money.","My husband and I booked this months in advance on Air B & B before we arrived to Nusa Penida, and it was such a beautiful experience. We arranged (for an additional cost) to have the staff pick us up from the port. We had to pay a port tax when we arrived‚Äîjust a heads up! It was about 40 minutes away by car. This island seemed to be full of more cars with drivers than people on scooters. The views were beautiful at the glamping spot. We had tons of water, which we loved as it was super hot. If you have the opportunity to do this, then do it! It was a very unique and cool experience. If you are not a fan of the outdoors and nature then I do not recommend this for you. Our host was friendly and great with communication. They will deliver dinner (for an additional cost), which was delicious. Breakfast was included with our stay, and was also delicious. They will also tour you around the island, should you want to see all the attractions!"

We received a warm welcome from the owner, Yuta, whose genuine interest in his guests made the atmosphere feel very homely. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the cottages themselves were beautiful and spacious, perfect for a multi-night stay. The location is delightfully peaceful, providing ample time to relax and recharge. The price-quality ratio is excellent. Although a mosquito net over the bed would have been a nice addition, Yuta's exceptional hospitality more than compensated for this minor issue.","We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to stay for our time on Nusa Penida. Not only are there less tourists at the east side of the island but you‚Äôre also around the corner from the most stunning sunrise spots. There are convenience stores around the corner but not ATM‚Äôs (though you can pay by card in restaurants and shops). The bungalow comes with a nice double bed, en-suite and (crucial) air-con. The place felt like home right from the start and it so happens that the owner just opened a restaurant next door with a fantastic choice of local and international dishes throughout the day. Check Eastside  Penida on google and Instagram. They also helped us out organising a driver for the day and activities! Whatever you need‚Ä¶ just ask!","Very good place to stay, bungalows clean, whole place looks very well - owner seems to be taking good care of it. Speaking of the owner, he speaks fluent english which was a very pleasant surprise, he was also very helpful and caring.

Breakfasts there were fine - fried rice or noodles with some fruit salad and tea.

You also need a bike to get to the beaches and you can rent it right at the cottages too - Perfect.","The little bungalow-cottages are very nice. The staff is amazing, they organised all transfers and our wished snorkelling trip for us - and everything for fair prices!
The breakfast consists of either fried rice with egg or scrambled egg and a bowl of fresh fruit (see photo, super yummy!), plus tea. Coffee packets and a water heater are available in the bungalow.
There is no hot water, only lukewarm but that wasn‚Äôt a problem for us, it was quite refreshing after a hot day.
Overall, a pleasant experience.","Amazing stay! The views from the front of the room are brilliant, breakfast was lovely (they adjusted the breakfast for us to make it vegan) and the cottages are very clean and homely. They are only a 5 min drive/20 min walk to Diamond Beach and Atuh Beach and the guys were really helpful with advice and booking a snorkelling trip! ‚ò∫Ô∏è considering it's just off a road there was no issues with noise wither which was great"

We had spicy seafood soup and fish soup, both delicious. For mains my husband tried katsu chicken which was really good and I went for Indonesian fish (recommended in menu) which was also really nice and delicate, but be mindful - it‚Äôs spicy! Cherry on top was the desert. We shared fried banana, which was a great contrast of warm banana and cold ice cream. Really nice atmosphere, owner and all the staff plus the views around!",Beautiful place to recover after almost dying of heat to get those beautiful Instagram photos at Atuh and Diamond Beach. The smoothie bowl is better than any influencer location and the lychee tea was a perfect refresher after the hike! The food was super fresh and the chicken satay was delicious.,"Stopped here for lunch, the owner chatted to us and was very polite, the food looks less favourable in the menu but when you get it it ends up being delicious! Great small local business!","There are FLIES everywhere, the place smells like cow feaces and feels very dirty. Big HYGIENE concerns. Would NOT recommend at all!","Stopped here for lunch after Diamond/atuh beach. Friendly staff but food was ok.

My husband loved his mango smoothie bowl, I didn‚Äôt love the strawberry pancakes. Bananas were sold out when we came or else I would‚Äôve gotten the fried bananas, which look good!"

Breakfast was absolutely delicious and fairly priced. Beautiful and relaxing view of terraces. Great service! Would book again if staying in this area.,We had stopped by here to use their ATM.

Then the food came.. super tasty, presentation was really nice. No long waiting times and the menu had so6me locally sourced products which was great.

This place scored extra points for having a nice bathroom, clean and nice smelling.

I've been in hospitality 20 years working all over the world and  it's always nice to see great  places that hit all the notes...

Cannot fault the experience, the owner Yuta definitely knows his stuff. It was evident that he had been around alot, his experience really shows through his restaurant.

10/10","This is a hidden gem near the popular Diamond Beach. We enjoyed a delightful breakfast here, including a latte, a cappuccino, a tortilla, and scrambled eggs. Everything was excellent, and we loved the restaurant.

The atmosphere is truly cozy, and the service is outstanding. Yuta, the owner, is very friendly and attentive. I would recommend this place not only for relaxation but also for enjoying delicious food with fresh ingredients.

Highly recommended!","The owner Yuta is such a wonderful host! I had the seafood pasta and WOW ü§© it is genuinely the most flavorful and delicious seafood pasta I have ever eaten! 10/10 recommend! My wife had the shrimp dumplings steamed and also very delicious with the sweet chili sauce.

Highly recommend this restaurant and you will have a great experience and prices are very good!","Eastside Penida is a hidden gem just 4 minutes to the beach!

The service was amazing and the food just delicious!

Had the Grilled Salmon and it was just the best I ever had!

Definitely the best restaurant on the Island.

The chef is so kind and will provide you with everything you need.

Next time you go to Diamond Beach, you definitely need to stop there üòÅ","My partner and I recently had the pleasure of dining at Iwayan‚Äôs Restaurant, located close to Diamond Beach on Nusa Penida. From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the excellent service that remained consistent throughout our visit.

We started our meal with young coconuts, a refreshing choice that set the tone for a delightful culinary experience. For starters, we had the Eastside Wings, which were a perfect blend of flavor and spice, whetting our appetites for the main courses to come.

Our mains included the grilled tuna teriyaki and Ayam Asap. The grilled tuna teriyaki was perfectly cooked, tender, and infused with a delicious teriyaki glaze that complemented the fish beautifully. The Ayam Asap, a local specialty, offered a unique and smoky flavor that showcased the chef's expertise and creativity.

One of the highlights of dining at Iwayan‚Äôs was the serene and picturesque setting. Surrounded by lush greenery and a tranquil atmosphere, we found the view to be wonderfully calming. The background music enhanced the ambiance, making our meal even more enjoyable.

We ended our meal with a cup of Balinese coffee, made from local beans. It was the perfect finish, offering a rich and robust flavor that lingered pleasantly.

It's evident that the chef at Iwayan‚Äôs has traveled extensively, bringing a wealth of experience and a touch of global influence to the dishes. The restaurant itself is a testament to this, creating a beautiful and welcoming space that we thoroughly enjoyed.

We are already looking forward to returning and exploring the breakfast menu, eager to see what other culinary delights await us at this gem of a restaurant on Nusa Penida.

Thank you, Iwayan!"

I give the highest rating because of their true hospitality. They are super friendly and take care of us very well. But overall, I really enjoy staying here.","Cozy room, feel like home.
