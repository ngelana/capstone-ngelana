Feels like you're eating at someone's house in a very homey way.

The food was amazing. I really love their pork ribs with reasonable prices. Spent around 200k for 4 persons.

My only problem was the setting is basically semi outdoor, so you had to bring your own umbrella if it's raining. Other than that, none. I will definitely come back.",Food are really good. Staff are friendly. Price affordable. All pork menu. However it can get pretty hot on day time as it has no air condition.,"Worth the price. Portion was good too. Had the jumbo pork ribs and it was fell off the bone. Service was okay.

They have kids playground but it next door. You CANNOT have what you ordered here and eat by the playground since it's not 'HALAL'. Found it a little bit dissapointing, but glad the server by the playground would watch my kid when i asked her to.

Would recommend this place to others and will definitely come back.","We were very excited to eat porkpoy, we gone there many times when and ordered gojek allot. However today we learned that they were at a new place. The food however tastes nothing like the old porkpoy. I was actually really disappointed with the taste. The sate babi was very sour and very soft texture, also the bumbu wasn't tasteful like it used to be. Actually nothing tasted like the old porkpy, I used to get really excited eating here but today i left sad and unsatisfied. Sad to see another delicious food ruined.","Special pork lover ,balinese Chinese, style, good taste"

The coffee shop is tiny, it is about 2 meter wide, but have 3 stairs full of customer! Been served coffee lover since 1940, runned by 3rd generation of the family.

open daily at 06:00 to 00:00, they kept traditionally way of brewing just as in 1940.

one of the legendary place in Tabanan, that you can‚Äôt miss! my recommendation is Kopi Susu (8K) and Kopi Saring (6K). also they provide tons of delicious jajan pasar, exactly what you want to chew while enjoying coffee.","Kopi: Legend!
Service: Excellent!
Atmosphere: Classical Ambience!
Price: Economis!","The legend coffee shop in Tabanan regency. The best taste for coffee around Tabanan. Inexpensive so you can afford it with well-vibe to share your meeting or your bussiness. Easy to find for locals, but if you are foreign, It's located exactly beside of the Bintang Baru shop and Kawan shop.","The vibe is great for hanging out and enjoy the coffee. I ordered hot milk and ginger, and it's so great ngl. And this coffee shop is cheap too.","What a people coffee.

Exceptionally underrated in Bali, even within the Balinese community.

For a meat+fried food dish, it is exceptionally clean in taste. Mouth feel isn't oily, flavours aren't overpowering (although sambal is incredibly spicy) the variety of flavours from sweet to savory are a treat to have and portion size is perfect for a meal, unlike other places that over provide.

It's somewhat hard to locate with only one way roads. To make matters worse it is along a remote street. GPS location is correct though! Stop your car outside the main street and walk in.

Definitely recommend this place.","The crispy pig skin, and spicy sambal here is great. The food also feels clean and neat.
The portion is Okay, not too much and not too small.
The seats are traditionally on floor, on bali traditional house.
Nice place to visit.","Best bigul ever! I have few preferences but this one is one of my favorite. Taste is light and a bit different from others. They have small, medium and big portions.
