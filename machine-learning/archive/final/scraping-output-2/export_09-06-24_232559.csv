There were only a few people there, which made the experience even more enjoyable. Highly recommended if you're in the area.","A stunning, powerful, waterfall. 42k entry cost (for 2 people and 1 bike). Steep set of stairs down to the waterfall (which make the climb back up a bit of a physical challenge). Once you're down at the waterfall it's incredible. The water is cool and the spray is monumental.","10/10 waterfall, beautiful, gigantic powerful, amazing nature and very chill temperature down there.","Amazing waterfall, the best I have ever seen. The energy & the vibes seeing it in front of u is incredible. I dont think any picture or video can transfer that feeling. The way up is quite hard üòÇ

We loved it, will come back if possible","A popular place among tourists. I had to wait 40 minutes to take a photo without people.

The waterfall is beautiful and powerful, especially if you come close to it. There are good, but long steps leading to the place. I recommend combining a visit to this waterfall with other places.

At my inst I have collected a collection of 30+ waterfalls in Bali pavelcore_108"
