They have a very comfy and clean room.. the service is great, ask the price to the owner first, you could call through their CP number cause sometimes the price in some apps got a little bit different than the actual price, but overall its a good place to stayüëç","SCAMMERS!

The food is super delicious at it price range, the sambal also really good - it‚Äôs not that spicy but really flavor-full.

The only minus is there‚Äôs some flies in the place, if you‚Äôre okay with that (like me), this place is a real go-to, or you can just use online delivery.","Ayam Bakar Bali Tulen Kampial is a fantastic spot for anyone craving delicious grilled chicken. The chicken itself is the star of the show - perfectly cooked with a smoky charcoal flavor that's truly mouthwatering.

The prices are very reasonable, making it a great option for both locals and tourists.  Be prepared to wait a bit for your food, though, as they seem to grill everything fresh to order. This wait is definitely worth it for the delicious and authentic taste.","Not a fancy restaurants with a tasty roasted chicken. It is located by the street and easy to spot.

Really love the roasted chicken here with its authentic sambal (chili sauce). The chicken is served with two types of sambals, but the one with lemongrass is so delicious.

I do not really recommend the ayam geprek (smashed chicken) because the taste tends too general and not really appetizing.

Price-wise, quiet reasonable with the taste and facility. This restaurants also has some franchise it the other areas in Bali.","Delicious baked chicken. The taste is balance, sweet & spicy. Well baked. Affordable price.","Always buying my favorite dishes here
Ayam Bakar Madu is the best one and with 2 kind of delicious sambal
Recommended!"

We were very impressed with his professionalism and dependability. He is very personable and accommodating, and if course knows a lot about the island and helped us with our itinerary. I rate him 5 stars on all areas. Hire him, you won't regret it!","Wonderfull service, new vehicle, clean. And the driver was very kind, and help us to plan our trip because several plan need to changes due to weather. I will use this travel again when i come back to Bali. Thank you","Read so much good review & decided to book from cosmo during our trip to bali. Unfortunately we didnt get wayan as our driver that people‚Äôa rave about but instead a guy name pak komang who he mentioned has 20years experience as a driver in bali. He‚Äôs spoiled our mood with his sour face everyday & forcing us to go to the place that he suggesting. If we decide not to go then he will automatically be less friendly & gave us silent treatment. Other than that, every single place we have to find him & he even asked us to walk to parking lot which sometimes quite far as we have kids it is difficult to cross busy road.

We went to uluwatu around 5+pm to watch the beautiful sunset but before able to watch the sunset the driver call us & asked are we done yet because the traffic gonna be bad on the way back to seminyak later. Hence, we werent able to watch the sunset just because he cannot handle driving in heavy traffic.

This is the fifth time we went to bali & we had a great time at mara river but after checking out & stayed in seminyak we hire the driver so it will be easier for us family to move around for the next three day but everything changed.

We got so much things to complaint but it‚Äôs gonna be really long. He even dare to scam our money by dealing with a shop to charge us extra 100,000 rupiah from the price we have to pay, what an unhonest person. Bottomline just AVOID, CANCEL or CHANGE driver if you got pak komang!","Wayan is the best driver/guide you could hope for in Bali! He‚Äôs punctual, polite, friendly, and most importantly very responsible. If you want to have a safe and fun time in Bali, he‚Äôs the guy you wanna hit up for sure!!","I have been using cosmos service since 20 years ago. The owner Pak Wayan, is a very honest and experienced driver which has established his business from 2 cars to 29 vehicles prior COVID and reduced to 15 cars and drivers due to COVID. His business still very strong because of his great work ethic and excellent customer service. Very reasonable price and all his cars are new and clean with strong air condition.

I highly recommend COSMOS car rental that always reliable, honest and experienced. I‚Äôll not hire any other car rental with driver except COSMOS. Thank you Pak Wayan for making my children and my trip in Bali such a stress free and memorable one. Your services are amazing! The amount of time you waited for my arrival and didn‚Äôt even charge me extra, was a very generous gesture. Thank you that really give me a piece of mind knowing you‚Äôll be there waiting till my arrival regardless of my flight delayed.

Keep up the amazing work COSMOS"
