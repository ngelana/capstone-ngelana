It was a wonderful experience. The setting and amenities of this hotel are amazing. We loved the pool and the little petting zoo was just perfect for our daughter. Also the kids club is very lovely and rhetorical staff is super friendly. My husband tried the archery class and I did aerial yoga. I must say both classes were incredible. The staff was very friendly and helpful all the time. They were super awesome with our little daughter.
Food was great and good quality.
It was my husband’s birthday and they surprised him with a little cake, what was so thoughtful. Thank you so much for the unforgettable time. We loved every minute of it.","Everything about this hotel is excellent. The rooms were spacious, cozy and luxurious. The staff was super friendly, accommodating and could communicate well. The restaurants were delicious, the pool is fantastic. We did the floating breakfast and that was awesome. The gym could be a little bigger, but aside from that I have no critiques.","Great service, No private pools, but the public one is very big. Great food, lots of options and very nice buffets. Archery and many of the activities were super fun. The aerial yoga instructor was very bad though and played favorites and was not helpful towards everyone. That was probably the most disappointing thing about the stay.","Possibly the best breakfast in any hotel I’ve ever been. And also, the breakfast location up high overlooking the pool and jungle!

Staff are exceptional!

I thought the evening restaurant food (both upstairs and at the pool could have been tastier and more substantial)

The pool is fantastic and so big. However, the whole main pool is surrounded by children, even though there is a separate children’s pool. I wouldn’t mind children in the main pool, if it was confined to one area.","It was a serene and beautiful resort. Our highlight would be going to The Spa, high end treatments with a very affordable price. The staff was amazing, we got a couple deal. It was a total package. They set the ambiance with the music, scent and light just right. Such a wonderful experience."

Incredible hidden gem, beautifully kept gardens with spectacular jungle views. We got to witness the sunset and were rewarded with many fireflies shortly after dark.

There is also the opportunity to trek down into the valley during the day time and there is a restaurant on site for those visiting during the day.

Our host was very attentive and knowledgeable on the surrounding areas. She also allowed us to taste the berries grown on the trees within the garden and hold some of the fireflies.

Photos don't do the place justice, it's a place you need to visit in-person.
Would highly recommend visiting this unique place and cannot wait to return.","We loved the experience!
But let’s start from the beginning:
It was a bit hard to find for our driver, but we were guided. The garden is very hidden in the back behind buildings. So watch the signs if you go on your own!
We were promptly greeted by a very nice lady why asked us for the contribution to enter the garden, before we were guided through a gate into the garden. It’s very well maintained and has some very nice features and interesting animals to discover (the latter depends on luck though, so to not wake false promises I leave it to you to see what or who you will meet).
We arrived at 18:30 to see a bit of the garden, then we were served tee/coffee and waited for the beautiful sunset (see picture). It took another 15-30 minutes before we saw the first fireflies. Each 15 minutes or so it became more. The lady who showed us around and served tea explained to us that the many flies are there as there are no pesticides being used. A safe space was also built next to the field where you can see them in a protected environment. This evening, it was blinking and glowing for us everywhere.
We left happy having seen so many fireflies and definitely recommend going!","This place is a hidden gem! Seeing fireflies up close is amazing, and knowing that people are working hard to bring back their habitat is such an encouragement.

To see the fireflies, it's best to go about half an hour before sunset. Enjoy the view before dark, and a tea/coffee and snack. Then stay and see the fireflies. You'll want to stay for at least an hour after sunset to let it get really dark. 100,000Rp entry includes the drink and snack :)","Underwhelming experience. There was no tour guide or anyone telling me more about the fireflies. I didn't feel welcome and comfortable at all. I wonder what I paid the 100k entry fee for. The place is beautiful in general and the cassava chips was delicious but really nothing much more than that. I guess one might enjoy it more with a company.
Also, the transfer fee was quite expensive (350k from Ubud and back).","Amazing! Good staff,beautiful view and when suns goes down a lot of fire flights showing and they have a small room that you could go and is full of them, you can even hold them."

Nice food. Staff are nice and helpful. We ordered the local specialty such as grilled chicken sambal matah and Padma grilled chicken.,"I had high hopes for Puhu Kitchen based on some of the reviews I'd read, but my experience was a mixed bag. First, the positives: the staff were friendly and truly amazing, trying their best under pressure. Their attentiveness and willingness to address issues as they arose were commendable.

Now, onto the food - a critical element for any restaurant. The inconsistency was noticeable. While the salmon poke bowl was incredible, striking the right balance of flavors and textures, the other dishes left much to be desired. The risotto was overwhelmingly salty and had a bitter aftertaste, and the chicken was disappointing, marred by bits of gristle.

I understand that restaurants can have off nights, especially when crowded, but it seemed like the kitchen was struggling to maintain quality with the volume of patrons. Despite having made reservations, the wait time exceeded an hour and a half, which, combined with the inconsistent food quality, was disheartening. While the offer to order something else for free was appreciated, I was too disenchanted by that point to continue the meal.

The bustling open kitchen, while theoretically a sign of transparency and freshness, appeared disorganized and overwhelmed, which might explain the lapses in food quality. It's disconcerting to see a busy kitchen not running smoothly, especially when it impacts the dining experience.

In summary, while the staff at Puhu Kitchen are doing their best and are incredibly friendly, the food inconsistency and long wait times detracted significantly from the experience. I hope they can find a way to balance the crowd with maintaining food quality, as I believe there's a lot of potentials here. But for now, I'm left with mixed feelings.","We visited twice and the restaurant held its rating

—

1st visit

Had dinner here and ordered from the dinner a la carte menu.

Food price is high, expected for this type of establishment, but worth it.

Good flavors, large portions. My group only had mains and have leftover on the plate.

Service is excellent.

Appetizers at ~100 k
Mains at ~200 k
Desserts at ~50 k

2nd visit

Portions and quality remains the same.",We stayed in Padma so we visited the restaurant both for breakfast and dinner. In the breakfast the quality and the variety of the food was excellent. 3-4 different buffet with different options from meat to noodles to eggs to desserts. One of the best breakfast I have seen in a hotel. We also had dinner in this restaurant. They have plenty of choices to decide what you want to have. I tried the pork ribs and chicken kareeg both amazing. Perfectly cooked with unique flavours and quite big portions. Exactly what you expect from a restaurant like this. Also I can never forget the breathtaking view of the jungle! Must visited restaurant and top recommended!,"A restaurant for Club members (floor 3,4) to enjoy breakfast.
Like others of the Resort, foods is not very diversified but acceptable. Fresh juices are quite nice.
View to the swimming pool and the forest."
