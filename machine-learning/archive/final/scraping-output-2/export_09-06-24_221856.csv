This was exactly what I was looking for in Bali, away from the touristy instagram nonsense. Up in the mountains this is where you feel relaxed surrounded by nature and looked after by ZanZan and Putu. The meals they cook are delicious and so many different dishes - the best I had in Bali. They are full of stories and interesting local knowledge. They organised a trip for us to see waterfalls and have lunch in the rice field where the view was incredible. Their niece also does amazing massages. We went in January and were the only ones staying - please consider going in off season, it’s quieter and greener, a bit of rain but enough sun and you will be supporting families when they need the business. As with any jungle hut style places, if you are worried about bugs just make sure you keep the nets down and tucked in and bring ear plugs if you might struggle to sleep as the frogs, geckos etc are loud - but overall just embrace it it’s magic! Only come here if you’re going to be respectful and find joy in the nature, otherwise stick to luxury tourist accom elsewhere. I was with 2 friends at this point but would’ve been very happy & comfortable going there solo. They also recommended a guide for our next stop at Mt Batur. Lovedddd it!!! Thank you ZanZan & Putu!","OMunity is truly a hidden gem! A friend recommended this place to me. If you want to experience real Balinese culture, look no further. Up in the north of Bali, up windy mountain roads, you’ll find a place you can call home. An oasis to rest and recharge your batteries. Breakfast’s included, but lunch and dinner were so reasonable and delicious, I had all my meals here. You eat together in the large community dining tables. I miss it already!
I loved the outdoor shower with warm water! I also loved having my morning tea on my porch in front of the pool and surrounded by nature.
They offer many things to do or you can just relax. I participated in a cooking class and saw many waterfalls.
ZanZan and Putu are amazing hosts. They will go above and beyond for you.
OMunity’s a great place for groups, families or friends. There were other families and groups of people staying here while I was. I was solo and stayed three nights.","Peaceful Peaceful Peaceful - the family that runs this beautiful oasis radiates with light, love and joy. The meals prepared by the mother and grandmother are always the highlight of our trip to Bali. They are very focused on sustainability and helping the future of the environment for the island. If you want to experience the simple, sweet and beautiful essence of Bali Village Life, this is definitely a place to visit.","So blessed to have found this peaceful place. This is Bali at its roots. Zanzan and Putu are incredible hosts. From the culture, to the delicious food, to the attention to environmentally friendly practices. We couldn’t have been luckier to end up here. Our stay included rice terrace trekking, swimming in waterfalls, and a traditional house blessing. One of the most memorable travel experiences.","If you are looking for an authentic Bali experience this is a great place to go. We were able to see a cremation ceremony in the local village, eat delicious Balinese food made by Putu, and do morning yoga with Zanzan. If any of these things appeal to you and you are willing to sacrifice a small amount of comfort (there will likely be bugs in your room, though the net around your bed allows you to sleep soundly), then this is a good place for you. The food was a highlight for me, it was almost all gluten free/vegetarian and it was fantastic. Zanzan and Putu are very nice and speak good English so there are no communication issues. Definitely reccomend if you are looking for an interesting experience with kind people!"

We loved the house, the garden space and the tranquility. The food was great and Ayu made us feel very welcomed.
We strongly recommend this place!","Our week-long stay at this home was outstanding!

Nestled in a secluded spot with breathtaking views of rice terraces and the river valley. The only sound you'll hear is the murmur of the river. The house comes fully equipped with everything you could possibly need for a comfortable stay: a large, cozy bed, a sofa, and a storage system for clothes.

Wi-fi connection was 50 mbps!

The kitchen was a highlight for us, and we were thoroughly impressed! It was stocked with sauces and spices, and featured new, stylish cookware along with all the essentials needed to prepare meals at home. Having a bike made it convenient for us to fetch groceries from the Clandy supermarket (20-minute ride away).

We were able to fully immerse ourselves in a peaceful retreat! Highly recommended.","I was looking for a place to take our family that reflected the ‘real’ Indonesian life. Sunset sala did not disappoint. The accommodation is perfect, basic yet wonderfully comfortable. The food is wonderful and prepared with the ladies with love. Activities we enjoyed were a visit to the waterfalls, a cleansing ceremony and learning how to make the Hindu offering baskets. I can’t recommend this place enough if you want to get away from it all. Thank you Sunset Sala for providing such a wonderful respite from our regular lives and sharing your culture with us. Until next time.","Sunset Sala is walking distance to the traditional Balinese village of Sudaji and also a short scooter ride to the awe inspiring Sekumpal waterfall. Food cooked by Komamg and Ayu is delicious, fresh and authentic. Gede who picked me up at Padang Bai  is an absolute gentleman, and ended up showing me so much about life in Bali and giving me great insights into the area.if you want an experience in the real Bali, this is the place to stay.","Our stay at Sunset Sala went way beyond our expectations. The room is magical, made of the most beautiful carved wood, thought in every small details. The staff is so kind and nice, very reactive and friendly and will make all in their possible to make your stay perfect. The environment is very unique: located in a small, traditional village, you’ll live immersed in a very luxurious nature for the length of your stay. We could see from our bed lots of butterflies and birds. The area offers so many activities, from learning how to make an offering or to cook the most delicious balinese food to going to explore famous waterfalls with locals… so many things to discover you’ll probably want to extend your stay! You specially SHOULD NOT miss the full day trekking with Coco: for a whole day you’ll be exploring by foot the forest, rice fields and waterfalls around the house, chatting with the locals and even be invited to wedding or 2. This is really a one of a kind experience that truly worth it!! Thanks Ibu Ayu and Coco for this highlight of our holidays in Bali 💖"

They are really nice people and you get to have nice conversations with them.
The pool is fantastic. The food is amazing.
The rooms are big. I loved the bathroom bc it is also really big and private.
When we got to our room there was something I didn't like and I spoke with Dede. He was very helpful and changed our room.
Thanks for the amazing experience!","I don’t have the words to describe this place, people in Sudaji is so welcoming, helpful, kind and happy for receiving tourists that they make you feel like home. It is not easy to get this place without a scooter but if you need transportation they will provide you this service. I spend one week here and could stay more.I felt so good, relaxed, connected with nature and with one of the most amazing Balinese people I’ve met. If you want to chill and relax this is the perfect place to stay ! Also very close to Fiji and sekumpul waterfalls and some other nature spots. Highly recommend! Thank you all and hope to come back soon 😄","I absolutely loved my stay at Lotus Guesthouse. I was supposed to stay only one night, but I ended up staying one more night just to enjoy the view and the pool. The guesthouse is located in a small village surrounded by beautiful rice fields,  mountains, view of the ocean. Sri (the owner) made sure I had everything I needed. The room was beautiful, the view from the room was also beautiful (rice fields and mountains). The guest house is also very near a little river, and you can ear the sound of the water at night.
I ate at the Guesthouse and the food was delicious (and it was cheap) !
This guesthouse/hotel is by far my favorite in Bali, I don't think you can get better quality at that price.","Location is far away from the city! But overall stay was amazing (: the room is clean , toilets are huge. And the whole Balinese family is so welcoming and I learnt so much just by chatting with them about their way of life and how they live. GB the host, was also really kind to send me to lovina beach to do the dolphin tour for a small fee ( 45 mins away ). The infinity pool is amazing, you can chill the whole day here and soak away your troubles, away from the hustle and bustle of the city (: I highly recommend this place!","The best quiet place in the north of bali..
You can hear noise from the river to make relaxing.."

The energy of the place the area and people are is so beautiful. It’s the old school bali you dream of. The house is clean and fully equipped with everything you could need. Good wifi too but I advise to switch off and tune into nature. The food Ibu cooked was so yummy, the hospitality, comfy bed and nature is 10/10","I and my husband spent 5 wonderful days here.  The view of the rice fields and jungle was an absolute highlight of our Asia trip.  The house is beautifully furnished and is situated in a quiet area with lots of privacy in nature.  No neighbors, no scooter noise and a autentic village within walking distance with a local market and friendly people.  From the accommodation we were able to rent a scooter (75k per day) and drive to the Sekumpul waterfall in just 15 minutes.  We were the first there :)
t was also very nice to do yoga on the terrace (there were 3 yoga mats in the house).
The hostess cooked dinner for us and it was the best meal we have had in Bali so far! She is very sweet and the conversations with her were very nice!  She and her husband put a lot of love into their work.  The house is a little (hidden) gem 💖","If you are looking to get lost in nature, this is the place to be. The room is clean and comfortable, feels like a real home. The lady chef cooks really well. So be sure to ask her to prep all your meals as the location of this place is quite isolated. They welcome dogs, so, pls them along! I love it when owners are pet friendly. I give it 5 stars!",,
