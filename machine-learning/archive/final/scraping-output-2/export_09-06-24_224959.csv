ChIJt1nN3Yv10S0RdgiSa4KZHCg,Tira Vilagna Suites & Spa,-8.2600874,115.3337451,"Jalan Shanti, Padang Mun, Kec. Kintamani, Kabupaten Bangli, Bali 80652, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=2890353846294546550,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 6209977,resort_hotel,"resort_hotel, hotel, lodging",4.7,309,,"This place is a gem! We had a blast staying here, the rooms are clean, the service is impeccable, the location is so quiet and peaceful. The weather is nice and cool. The stairs are quite a workout, and the staff helps out with the luggage so that‚Äôs ok. Will definitely come back again. However, best to check the weather forecast before coming, as the temperature drops suddenly and gets very cold at times. Come prepared with some thick clothing.","This place is an oasis to escape to from the busier Bali, but it is not quite perfect. It will be a big gamble if you're coming here for peace and quiet.

Rooms are poorly soundproofed, which is great to immerse yourself in the sounds of nature, but very painful when you have to deal with other guests that are not mindful of others and do not respect the tranquility. We unfortunately had to endure noises of elephants walking upstairs, screaming children waking people up, loud drunks invading our privacy at night, and extremely loud ""adult""-rated noises that seemed to come from right next to us.

The staff is the real heart of this place and was very professional, helpful and flexible in arranging a working solution for us, for which we are very grateful. Service was excellent and we loved the complimentary daily afternoon tea moments. The food in the restaurant tastes good and is fairly priced.

Some tips for the management:
- Attaching nets to the windows will be an easy improvement to keep bugs out and increase guest comfort.
- Improve soundproofing in the rooms and remind guests verbally during check in that they are not alone in this place.
- Train staff to intervene if there is clear misconduct in the dining room. Two couples had to change tables because a certain family was watching videos or having a call on loudspeaker in the middle of the room.","Room & location are great, and service is exceptional. They make a real effort to ensure their guests are happy. they are always around, and accommodate many special requests. I‚Äòve left some items behind, and they were kind and swift to arrange postal delivery. Absolutely worth every cent and more","Where to start?!
This place is heaven! A true respite from the world wow. I enjoyed so many things about this hotel.
The staff are angels, they are available for anything you need; friendly and welcoming, and their English is really good! the service is 10/10.
The rooms are really big and private! I came here to focus on a creative project so the desk looking out over the jungle forest was a huge perk.
The restaurant is divine, the food was so fresh and yummy I loved every meal! and the kitchen looks brand new and super clean like a top restaurant.
The facilities are stunning and so tranquil, there‚Äôs minimal road noise, the jungle is all around, and the overall ambience of the place is just really lovely the music they play the smiles from the staff the guests all are in a peaceful state.
Location is another perk - close to the main strip with lots of good places to eat if you like - but you need a driver or a scooter.
The hotel gave me contact to get a scooter and to book my Batur hiking and both were great recommendations.
There‚Äôs a lot of other little extra touches that make it so special here.
Thank-you for having me I really felt so at home and hope one day I will return to Kintamani again! ‚ô°","The last night situation spoiled the whole experience of staying in this place. At 20:00 we ordered food in the restaurant and tiramisu for take away. When we reached our room and tried it later on (1 hour later), we noticed that tiramisu is spoiled and smells like outdated milk. Since everything here closes pretty early at 21:00, there was nobody to complain to. We decided to speak about this tomorrow in the restaurant when it's open again. When we explained situation next day, we were told that the tiramisu already ""registered in the billing system"" and they can't refund it. We didn't pay with card and paid on our room account, so technically they could deduct the amount from our total bill or make a discount for a certain bill, but they did nothing. Their only solution was to replace this tiramisu with another one (a.k.a eat more of spoiled tiramisu). Staff blamed everything on us (we didn't store it right), didn't apologize and didn't try to resolve situation. For me this was a turn off that hotel that position itself as high-class resort has an attitude of a hostel. We didn't book the cheapest room (stayed in Deluxe), had like 1.2mln total bill for the food and they couldn't resolve such a tiny issue of 80k to leave a good impression after all. We ended up paying for the spoiled tiramisu full amount."
