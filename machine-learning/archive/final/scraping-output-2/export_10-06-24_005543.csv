Banjarangkan, Kabupaten Klungkung, Bali 80752, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=13615230249531469615,OPERATIONAL,+62 366 5437988,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.5,2248,,"My stay at this hotel was absolutely delightful. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the range of facilities available. The two pools, gym, spa center, and kids club provided ample entertainment options for guests of all ages. The opportunity to start the day with morning yoga was a rejuvenating experience.

What truly set this hotel apart, however, was the exceptional service provided by the staff. They were unfailingly professional, helpful, and greeted guests with genuine smiles. Their fluency in English made communication effortless, ensuring that all my needs were promptly attended to.

Although the hotel is situated away from the city center, this was a conscious choice for me to enjoy a peaceful environment. Transportation to the city was easily arranged through Grab, allowing me to explore the bustling cityscape at my convenience.

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a tranquil retreat with top-notch amenities and impeccable service. My experience here exceeded all expectations, and I look forward to returning in the future.","We enjoyed our stay in Wyndham. The staff were so helpful and friendly. Its right by the beach so you can hear the sound of the waves from your room which is lovely. Gym is pretty solid, everything we need was there. We made a furry friends there, please feed this cat for us if you see her ‚ù§Ô∏è","We had a most pleasant stay at the resort, and every interaction with the staff was hospitable üåû Our driver to and from the resort was lovely, the staff were always pleasant and attentive, and checking in and out was straightforward.

As there is not much else to eat around the resort, we were delighted to find a separate vegan menu with plenty of plant-based options üå± The staff also accommodated any dietary requests we had.

The rooms were spacious, looked like the photos, and kept very cool despite the heat. A boardwalk runs alongside the black sand beach, and you can hear the crashing waves around the resort. It‚Äôs to be noted that it‚Äôs not a beach for swimming, as it is quite dangerous; there are many pools in the resort, though.

Two nights we stayed, as a stopping point between travelling, and we would certainly stay again üôèüèº","This hotel is located at a very beautiful location, away from the crowds and other hotels. Actually, when you are driving to the hotel, you drive through a very local, scenic road, passing small houses and rice fields.
The reception is simple yet beautiful. There are few rice fields around the hotel, which are beautiful to see.
The hotel itself is a bit rundown and could use some maintenance to get it back to shape, especially when you consider that it‚Äôs a Wyndham.
The rooms are comfortable but, requires maintenance, especially the bathrooms, they require a lot of maintenance.
We did pay for the breakfast and it was horrible, to say the least. The buffet was poor and very little in terms of local good. My POV, I come to Bali for Bali/Indonesian food, not to eat bread with toast.
The restaurant food is a bit pricey but, lacks taste, not worth it in my opinion.
The beaches are beautiful with black sand but, not allowed to swim for some reason. The beaches also have a lot of pollution/plastics.
We used the pools, they definitely need some maintenance, broken tiles and rotting wood.
The fitness Center is in good condition.
The staff at the hotel are amazingly nice, sincere and very helpful, beautiful smiles.","I have to start with very friendly staff. Place is in a very calm area. It‚Äôs so relaxing. Very close to the beach (black sand on the beach) but you can‚Äôt swim. Place provides with two swimming pools ( one is under construction atm) and gym and spa facilities.

Food is 7/10 at the restaurant. Did not like the breakfast at all. Could be better.

Room is very spacious and bed is comfortable. Toilet is 5/10 clean.

Cons :
There were cockroaches and ants in the room.
Air conditioner was set to 18 but I was sweating and had to sleep without a top.
Room fridge was not cooling any bottles of water we put in.

It‚Äôs a nice place. Hopefully they will be better."

But day by day, beach abrasion makes this stunning black sand beach seems going to dissapear. The government is now constructing a wave brake in the shore. Just like another free entrance fee beach in Bali, trash will be everywhere especially in the parking area near the warung. This place is also used for balinese for their traditional ceremony.","Not a beach for a family outing, seems local community is using this brach area for fishing.
