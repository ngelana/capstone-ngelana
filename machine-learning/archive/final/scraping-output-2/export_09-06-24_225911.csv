Entrance is 5000 IDR per person.",Go when it s sunny !,a very beautiful place and the scenery is fabulous,"Love this place, not easy to reach but it worth the trip. The best time is at sunset, but also during the day the view is stunning. The family near there made a good job, the platform seems solid, the steps are regular and they built a really nice garden around"
