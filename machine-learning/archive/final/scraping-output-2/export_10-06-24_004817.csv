but for BATHROOM, it's The Worst
bad smelling and it's too dirty.
All valves in the bathroom were broken no repair at all.
DAMN!!! what the hack of this restaurant?","I order take out here twice when we were in Gianyar, the food taste good with reasonable price.",Too long in serving the menu is caused by fewer employees and less effective so it takes too long to waste time even though the service is like that but the existing staff are quite friendly,"Best place to hangout with girlfriend, friends or family. Come on weekdays is better so the place is not that crowded."

I don't know if they change their recipes or not but their taste just different from the first time they open. I feel like some kind of spices before then now the noodles taste like noodles with chilly and sweet soy sauce only.

The most thing I hate is their order system. Which we need to queue first to order then waiting for the food after that.

I hope they can figure how to handle the customer in a more proper ways.","Cozy place, goodfood good menu, same like others Kober, deliciousüëçüëç","Not too crowded on lunch, but too crowded for dinner","This is place good for youth, the food is local teaste and hot spicy, we can request the chili peppers. So we can arrange spicy."

From delicious dishes to refreshing drinks, every aspect contributed to a memorable dining experience. The attentive and accommodating staff added a welcoming touch, making me eagerly anticipate my next visit to this culinary gem.","+ the best pizza I've had in Bali
+ the best pasta I've had in Indonesia
+ very friendly staff
+ good prices
+ architecturally, the place is very interesting

* one time the place was closed an hour before the closing time","The pasta is very tasty, very cheap, the portion is small. We took pizza with cream sauce, the taste was not rich. add garlic to the sauce and believe me, it will be very tasty! do it!","We went specifically to get the ""Pragiatha"" pizza.  We ordered it, but a couple of minutes later the server came back and told us that they did not have any jalapenos in stock. So, we ordered a pepperoni pizza, but the sausage on that pizza was not pepperoni.  The flavor was okay so we ate it paid and left. The management here needs to service their menu.","It's decent if you're craving for a quick pizza fix.
The service was normal and the place is quite cozy and nice.
As for the food:
1. Tomato and Mushroom Pizza (2/10): Great outside crust and flavor, but it was dripping wet and watery in the middle.
2. Cheese Stick (2/10): Couldn't finish this, it was very heavy for a finger food and the mozzarella didn't melt.
3. Garlic Bread (5/10): A bit more garlic would really help.
4. Pragiatha Pizza (10/10): Great crust throughout and it holds its chape when picked up. The jalape√±o gives it a nice, fresh flavor profile.

The Pragiatha is proof that they can make great pizzas, but they really should improve their QC so no wet and watery pizza is served."

The place are so clean and comfort
I think the price is so reasonable based on the taste of the food
Next time, i will go back to this place","DELICIOUS!
I will come more often because they have so many MENU and i cant wait to try all of them. For this first visit, i tried simple fried rice with egg, i fu mie special and sweet & spicy chicken.

The i fu mie is so so but they are very generous with the vegetable, which i like.

The sweet and spicy chicken is also so so because I dont like the food presentation (the sauce is too red) the sauce taste a bit weird :(

The winner of todays menu is fried rice. Its simple,yet very tasty. I believe if the fried rice is yummy, the other menu should be okay.

And i took away the pork ribs. Lets see how it tastes.","It was okay, staff didnt bring me any sambal. they recommend me the gurame and it tasted bitter, the nasi goreng was good and the sapo tofu is good too, im gonna come again to try other menus."
