Tegallalang, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80561, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=16907338767939761384,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 8989999,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.9,106,,"Can not fault this beautiful resort. We stayed three nights and could easily stay another two weeks. We stayed in a villa (number 5) and it was private, peaceful and perfect. The villas are huge and the pool is the most incredible temperature, refreshing but warm.
The people here treat you like family, with special shout out to Alin from breakfast service who was incredibly warm and lovely and Tobi with his cocktail expertise and passion.
The spa was also extremely beautiful, with treatments by the spa manager second to none.
The grounds here are impeccable, and nothing is too much trouble. The food, service and hospitality are some of the best we‚Äôve seen.
Thank you for this beautiful time, it has been truly special.","The hotel is an oasis of peace. Very friendly staff. You feel welcome as soon as you check in. It is important that if someone wants to do a lot, the hotel is definitely too far away from Ubud with normal traffic about 25 minutes to the center. Most tour operators will not pick you up at the hotel because it is too remote.

Of course there are also negative points.

I traveled the whole week with Grab Taxis. For the trip to the airport about 2h or more on the last day I booked a cab through the reception because I wanted a safe car without stress. The price 700000 Idr was 300000 Idr more than with Grab. I assumed that a top car would pick me up. Unfortunately the worst car on the island came and that for 700000 Idr and 2h drive. Sorry but that is not possible. I think that the hotel guests should not be ripped off who otherwise pay enough. If it had been a good new car I wouldn't have said anything but that's the way it was.

I would definitely attach pictures to the menu cards. I never knew what I was getting. It's not burgers and fries but always special menus. Especially with the breakfast menu. I never got what I wanted. It tasted good but still. I've also heard that from other guests. That they would prefer that.
I got a splinter in my foot when I was walking along the pool. A wooden floor around the pool is rather rare, as it works and changes with the heat and wetness and so splinters occur. But I realize that they are not changing the floor now. But check for protruding pieces.

I think it's great to look after the environment. But please don't use eco cosmetic wipes in the bathroom. They are far too small and you always need 3 or 4 to wipe your nose. A real one like Kleenex would be much better.

As in all tropical hotels, the air conditioning smells of wetness and mold, but that's normal.

The fact that a railing was mounted on the jacuzzi with drilling and hammering exactly during the yoga class was perhaps not so well planned.

Now the positive points. The room is very large, you have a wonderful view of the jungle. The bed is super comfortable and large. Many small things are available free of charge. There is a free program the whole week. Free shuttle to Ubud. The pool is relatively cold and the jacuzzi extremely hot....I would love to come back anytime. What I'm writing here is of course a high level exclamation. But this is the only way the businesses can profit.
UBDATE 25.5.24

after the super positive feedback I increased my rating to 5 stars","Perfect hotel! We can only recommend it. We stayed here for 7 nights. The breakfasts are delicious and plentiful, the staff very nice and helpful, the environment was quiet and the location of the hotel perfect. Next time we are in Bali, Cicada is the obvious choice! European hotels! Learn in Bali!","We had a great experience at Cicada Resort. The rooms are spacious and the bed is comfortable. From our room we had an amazing view at the infinity pool and the jungle. The staff is extremely friendly. Furthermore, the resort offers one of the best breakfasts that we‚Äôve ever had. Would definitely come back here.","HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED - PLEASE READ

Just before leaving for Bali looking forward to the holidays, I received an email from the booking agent (AGODA) informing me this hotel is unable to fulfill our booking even though we already confirmed it days prior. (Not to mention the hotel is not sincere enough to reach out to us directly to resolve and chose to go through an intermediary).

Now, the best part to show their utter lack of customer service, they are offering me a downgrade (from villa to a suite) without any refund, and in exchange just brush me off with a couple of free meals.

I believe this way of treating a confirmed customer is shocking, especially coming from a business in the hospitality industry. I have never experienced such bad service recovery even before setting foot in a hotel.

Utterly disappointed in the hotel's lack of sincerity to reach out directly, and more importantly lack of sincerity to offer any reasonable hospitality or service recovery."

The pictures did not reflect the reality of the hotel during our stay. Overall the hotel was overpriced for its conditions. The hotel was worn and required a lot of surface level maintenance. Quiet area with forest lookout. Construction behind the hotel. The room was decent for our short two night stay. The pool was alright. The dining hall was worn and a bit neglected. The staff member that tended to us was friendly and kind. Overall we would have selected a hostel for our short stay instead of this overpriced hotel that did not provide what was depicted online.,"Such a great experience to stay here during Nyepi they provide everything, the staff is super friendly and nice, their services is very good. Also the room are clean and the view is fantastic.","""I had the opportunity to spend 10 days at Lumbung Jaya, and the service was excellent. The quality of the restaurant was truly outstanding! And the rooms were absolutely charming!
I greatly appreciated the hotel's setting, which provided genuine comfort and a change of scenery.
In summary, I had a flawless 10 days at the hotel, which allowed for a wonderful stay. Thanks to them for their friendliness, availability, and quality of service. Thank you very much!""","Staying here is more of a private room hostel experience than hotel. The building is very run down, pool looks sketchy, TV is all Indonesian, and there's nothing nearby to visit. However, it gets more than 1 star because the hosts are very friendly, and we got to enjoy an Indonesian puppet show rehearsal on site.","Great place, clean and with hot water. Lovely view in the middle of the nature, staff super kind, brought us breakfast in the swimming pool and made us try some local fruits.
We  left our luggages after checkout, so we could enjoy the day tour without trouble.
Super recommend it, the only problem was a monkey üêí tied on a tree, they told us that he was rescued and didn‚Äôt want to go back to the nature. Anyone, the rope could, at least, be longer."

The veggies are out of stock so we requested a Capcay with leftover veggies and she cooked it so well (also made it free for us). Will come back here for the second time!","Best place For lunch

I was there for lunch with my family i got pork ribs and my kids had crispy duck and smoothies bowl. Taste are so yummy and I was really surprised because all those foods are cheap but the quality are super
If you guys arround here or pass by you should visit this wonderful place","We ordered Chicken Satay (3/5) and Nasi Goreng (4/5, had some shredded chicken bones inside, tasted... Like nothing in particular) and fresh orange juice (5/5).

The restaurant hadn't been properly cleaned in a long time, bird and gecko poop everywhere, we cleaned the table ourselves with some napkins. Spider webs, dust, ... It just needs some cleaning.

Good thing - we paid 75k for everything, no extra tax, no extra service charge...","Very affordable price, very comfortable environment, very cheap prices (prices already include the tax), very good food.","Good placeto have Lunch

I went there for a lunch break on the way from Ubud to Batur.  I tried local food there, the fried rice and ayam goreng lalapan (chicken) tasted very good and the price was very affordable, the atmosphere was also very beautiful because I could see the rice fields from the second floor.  I am very happy to be here and will come back again for those of you who pass through the Ubud Kintamani route, you should stop by at this place"

Chef David prepared an extensive set menu for us, allowing us to get a taste of the restaurant‚Äôs contemporary international cuisine. Each dish was well thought out, with the numerous elements blending together to create all sorts of interesting flavor notes. I especially enjoyed the Boston lobster with salsa, which was supremely fresh and had a nice bouncy texture; and the Wagyu ribeye which was well-marbled, soft, and juicy. Desserts were also very solid. All the while, we were able to enjoy the restaurant‚Äôs open-air ambiance, which was comfortable and panoramic.

Gede and his wife went above and beyond to encourage us and help us begin to learn how to use a scooter. Not only does he rent scooters but he also organises and facilitates trips in the Ubud area. We had such a special time today, a day we will never forget thanks to Gede and not ti mention his brilliant photography skills. We will cherish these pictures forever. Gede took us for a water purifying ritual in a temple, we went to a beautiful coffee plantation, the monkey forest and an off the beaten track waterfall.
