All the ingredients of the food are fresh. The waitress is very helpful and attentive. They know the product and can give you recommendations regarding the menu that you choose. This restaurant is more expensive than the others but it‚Äôs worth the price.,"my iced tea came late. also my kangkung.

the best taste is kangkung and rice.
noodle taste is ok, but the texture a bit dry.
baramundi taste is not balance. need more sweetness.

there is problem with their order system i think.","Delicious! The seafood was really good. All the fish tasted fresh and the portions were generous. I had various clams, steamed fish, crab, and the oyster omelette. The oyster omelette in particular really stood out to me but I can say for certain that everything we ordered was top notch.

The restaurant can be a bit hot and its location is off the road. It might seem like you're going the wrong way but trust the map location. Nonetheless, the food is very local and the staff are very nice, toilets were clean. The final bill was pricey but we ate for 4 and ordered for 6 people so it was definitely reasonable and most importantly, worth it!",There‚Äôs price for freshness! Undisputed for their freshness. Only recommended for someone who truly appreciate Live Seafood freshness as dine here could be very costly.,"HTP Seafood truly excels in culinary delights, especially with their delectable sauces. Known for serving some of the finest seafood in Bali. However, be forewarned about the pricing, it can catch you off guard. For example, the imported scallops are divine but come with a hefty price tag. The Udang Rongeng (fried shrimp) and fried calamari are also outstanding choices. Vegetarian options like Tauge Ikan Asin and Kangkung Tauco add variety to the menu.The ambiance is average, but they offer VIP rooms for those seeking privacy (IDR 5,5 mio minimum charge), albeit with a steep minimum charge. Currently, they accommodate 15 people across two locations, with plans to expand. Parking is ample, which is a plus. However, nighttime visitors should brace themselves for a somewhat eerie road. While the prices may give pause, the culinary experience makes it worthwhile for seafood aficionados looking to indulge in Bali's finest. Just be sure to check prices beforehand to avoid any surprises when the bill arrives."

I've sampled all their beans, from filter to espresso roasts. My top pick for an espresso blend is the rich Mochademia, while the Peaberry variety shines in a V60 brew.

If you like filtered coffee, this is the place for you. They have a wide variety of coffee beans that you can choose for your coffee. Mostly local beans from Bali and other parts of Indonesia.
I got filtered coffee with bali beans, and it tastes amazing. It's fruity and fresh, and there's a hint of sweetness to it.

However, we cannot recommend the Shrimp Porridge here and would rather vouch to go all-in on the dimsum options instead. The baked bakpao, xiao long bao  and turnip cakes are must tries in my opinion.

The atmosphere is also amazing, the interior decor is top notch, complemented with the outside view of Bypass Ngurah Rai. However, music selection somewhat ruins the chinese modern atmosphere. I don't think J-pop and Adele songs exactly fit with the asian vibe that the interior decor gives off.

Will definitely come back for more as these are relatively minor issues that can be easily fixed.","First time here.. A little bit surprised because the food we ordered was delicious.

We were brought here by our driver who suggested it the day before. We had time to kill until check in to our next place so a good place to stop and enjoy a cultural show.

Synopsis of the show:

THE BARONG AND KERIS DANCE
The Barong play represent an eternal fight between good and Evil Spirit. Barong ( a mythological animal)
Represent a good spirit and Rangda (a mythological monster) Represent and evil one

THE DANCE STARTS WITH MUSIC OVER TONE
Followed by his friend the monkey, The Tiger comes up. three masked dancers appear representing men making palmwine in the forest, whose child is killed by the Barong. The three met get angry and attack the Barong which is helped by the monkey. During the fight the nose of one of the three me is bitten off.

FIRST ACT
Two girl dancer appear representing the servants of the Rangda. Looking for the servants of Dewi Kunti who are on the way to meet their Patih 9 Prime Minister).

SECOND ACT
The servant of Dew Kunti come. One of the servants of the Rangda changes into a witch enters both servants to make them angry. The meet their Patihand go together to Dew Kunti.

THIRD ACT
Dewi Kunti and her son. Sadewa come up. Dewi Kunti has promised the Rangda to Sacrilfice Sadewa. A witch appears an enters Dew Kunti. She become angry and orders the Patih to bring Sadewa into the forest.
The Path is also entered by witch so he does not have pity on Sadewa. Sadewa is then taken into a forest and tied up on tree.

FOURTH ACT
Unknown by Rangda, Siwa god appears and gives Sadewa immortality. The Rangda appears, ready to kill Sadewa andeats him up but Sadewa is still alive. She then surrenders and asks him to redeem herself. Sadewa agrees and kills the Rangda. The Rangda goes into heaven

FIVFTH ACT
One of the servants of the Rangda called Kalika comes up before Sadewa and ask him to redeem herself too.
Sadewa repuse Kalika gets angry, and change herself into a boar and fights Sadewa. The boar an be defeated she then change herself into a bird but defeated again. Al last she changes herself into a Rangda. Sadewa cannot kill her. In such cicumstanses Sadewa ditates and then he changes himself into a Barong. Still the Rangda seems to be too powerfull and the fight is unended. Followers of the Barong appear and help him fight the Rangda.",Great barong show. It's just as good as the other shows in the Northeast of Bali. Highly recommend it.,"Wonderful performance. I watched the Barong dance show. It was a short and abridged play of the Barong story. You can experience an Indonesian grass root performance style, especially when the dancers interact cheekily with the audiences.
Although they handed out the English storyline, foreign visitors might want to have a translator that will translate the full storyline and explain the subtle interaction between the Gamelan players and the dancers on stage.
Front row seats are better, you get the surprises during performance! You are welcomed to interact with the dancers after the show."
