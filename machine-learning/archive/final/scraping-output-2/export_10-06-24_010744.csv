If you‚Äôre scootering would recommend parking half way down the narrow road at the ‚Äúpark here‚Äù sign as parking at the bottom near the cafes is tricky. Steep walk/scooter down to the beach but definitely worth it. Try Beach Cafe at Lago if you want a delicious coffee!,The absolute best little beach to hang out on. Two gorgeous cafes. One that serves the best coffee and breakfast options and the other that has authentic local food. You can hire surf boards or paddle boats and the snorkeling also superb. There is lots of natural shade.,"My type of beach (also known as coconut beach), it‚Äôs a pretty secluded location, no huge crowds. It‚Äôs also a safe beach to swim at. I‚Äôm not a surfer, but seems to be a spot for surfers to head out (paddle or get a boat out). As for food & drinks- there is a great local warung and a more modern cafe w juices and nice food.

This bar doesn‚Äôt do justice to the paradise that this island is. Prices are though the roof (90k for a beer). They advertise free boat ride to the floating bar (picture), but this only applies if you spend 200k beforehand of pay directly 200k per person. You can only pay by card and charge more that 10% tax for it. 4/10 wouldn‚Äôt recommend.","Noisy place with dogs who are barking all the time

Amazing way to serve coconuts (in a bottle), delicious and healthy food, you can swim, shower, chat and enjoy in shade

You can also pay for sauna and cold bath here and go upstairs (200k)

Things to improve:
-The road from/to the hotel is terrible.

- WiFi unstable

Yes some dogs barked (it's Indonesia üòÖ) but really?!

The accommodation was clean and fresh (it's not a bourgeois, fancy place so be realistic) and the view from our room was awesome (the steps were fine!). We had two little kids and they had a blast - other families stayed too and it was like a little pool party most days (while the parents sipped a coffee or a Bintang). It's closeness to the beautiful beach, Song Lambung, was so wonderful! The local boats to take you snorkelling each day or to the Pontoon bar for a cocktail and a snorkel were great. The snorkelling was epic! And Nila's Warung is just downstairs on the beach or it's a 5-10 minute walk into town for food or shopping.

The food at Song Lambung was so yummy! Breakfast is a simple choice of 3 menus (pancakes, eggs or toast and fruit, tea, coffee), overlooking the beach. The lunch and dinner food was great too - you must try their Bakmi Goreng, Nasi Goreng or Chicken Satay (some of the best we had in our two weeks there!).

Nic and his colleagues were great - they are happy to help with anything, they kept our room and the property tidy and cooked us delicious food.

Thanks Song Lambung Beach Huts for a memorable trip, we loved you! We will be back","find somewhere else, it‚Äôs not worth it to stay here.
1. the location was hard to find, no car acces to go to the hotel, so if u bring alot of stuff u need to walk carrying all ur stuff down the hillüòÇ

3. only card and cash, no transfer, i mean it‚Äôs 2024 who doesn‚Äôt do transfer these days?

You should definately try their Soto Ayam (chicken noodle soup, we did not have better one before), Ikam Pepe (fish in banana leif), curry, Grilled seafood (best calamari/ squid I have ever had) and also order Rendang at least 4 hours before or a day before and they cook it fresh for you so you can come later and enjoy it there.
I higly recommend this place if you visit Nusa Lembongan!

We had the best sleep in the huge comfortable bed.
Also, the staff is amazing - they and the story behind Morin Resort make this place something really special!

We stayed in the ocean suite, and it really captured the Lembongan vibe. The staff is friendly and speaks good English. The breakfast is okay, but I'm not too picky since my trip was all about relaxing and tranquility. It's a great spot for couples.

Now, the downside‚Äîthe hotel is pretty secluded compared to its competitors, which is something I liked. There's a beach just 100m away that's almost private. However, you‚Äôll need a motorbike to get there, and navigating the terrain can be tricky. I'm good with bikes, but my partner wasn't thrilled about being the navigator. Be prepared to get lost for a bit‚Äîyou've got to be a bit adventurous. That said, the lodging and overall experience make up for it.

Things to improve‚Äîour ocean suite came with an outdoor living room exclusive to our room, but it was separated and not connected by any walking paths. It felt odd and we hardly used it. To make it more appealing, I suggest the hotel connect the bedroom and living room with a walkway and enclose them with windows or something. This way, couples or families can actually enjoy the living room. Also, they should enclose the bathroom and add a fan to vent the air out, so mosquitos don't come in at night.

Their service is excellent‚Äîwhen I left my power bank in the room after checking out, they went above and beyond to ship it to me the next day.","Morin Resort is by far the most beautiful place we have ever stayed at. This is paradise. The view of our hut, the pool area, the food and the friendly people (especially Eka with her smile) were so unforgettable. Thanks for this amazing time. I really hope to be back some day.","We had the best experience staying at Morin Resort. We went for a scoot around the island and didn‚Äôt see anywhere we wished we had stayed instead. The atmosphere was so peaceful, the staff helpful and super lovely, excellent food and overall a really wonderful place to unwind. When we come back to Nusa Lembongan this is where we would choose to stay again.
Less than a 5 minute walk to Coconut beach, where you can swim or surf at Playgrounds.

The staff met us at dstar greeted us and showed us were we booked they carried our bags up a lot of stairs. The host organised a scooter for us to hire, when we were checking out staff extended check out time to suit our ferry then carried our bags to the dstar ferry office.

Everyone was so nice would recommend!","We stayed one night in Villa Tinggi and as expected the villas were very beautiful, however we were really disappointed in the fact the tress in front of our villa ruined the view, please trim them. The view is what you're there for and it was pretty much blocked.","This is the second time we have visited Aqua Nusa. It is the most incredible hotel we have ever stayed at. We love it so so much and highly recommend for families and or couples. People here are amazing, views are spectacular and the location is so convenient to the deck and Thai pantry. You won‚Äôt regret it. We will be back."

Thank you Gede and Staff","A beautiful getaway on Nusa Lembongan. Darsan was a really nice and beautiful place that we stayed in. The cottages are spread out so you don‚Äôt hear much of your neighbors and their staff is very friendly and accommodating.
It‚Äôs great for adult couples, families and kids!

We stayed for 3 nights and rented a scooter, arranged a boat trip to Nusa Penida for a day and even arranged our return trip back to Port Sanur all through the reception staff. Exceptional!

We believe this is a true gem and incredible value for your money. Highly recommended!","This is a lovely place we cannot recommend enough! The host is super friendly and arranged everything for us (scooter, snorkelling trip, ferry). The location is calm and next to a small beautiful beach. There is a nice pool, the surroundings are just beautiful and peaceful - small chicken running around. This just felt like home. 100% recommended!","Beautiful Wooden huts nested into tropical green setting with a large communal swimming pool and distant views of the sea.
A close walk to the nearby beach and a few restaurants.
Very helpful staff and owner who organised for 4 of us to go early in the morning on a private snorkelling trip to have an unforgettable swim with manatee rays and tropical fish.
Very good value for money",We have stayed here a number of times. Small family run hotel. Nothing is too difficult for friendly staff and owner. They are providing a great service and make us feel welcome. Can recommend this hotel to anyone.

We all thoroughly enjoyed our time and couldn't find any fault with the service provided.

Lago is unique and we now understand why people come to stay and never want to leave! Being able to experience it first hand really enables us to better market your property. The combination of the pontoon, wave break and villa makes for a very special offering. Moreover, the ice bath was an excellent addition. We were really impressed by the level of service provided by your staff.

See you again very soon!","I was lucky enough to experience #thelagolife last weekend, and what a life it is! The Beach House private villa epitomizes understated luxury, boasting unparalleled views of the crystal blue waters, breathtaking bedrooms and communal areas, a laid-back atmosphere, and an attentive and friendly staff dedicated to catering to your every need.  The best place to stay on Nusa Lembongan. We'll be back!","Amazing location, with equally amazing amenities and staff. We had a fantastic stay and particularly enjoyed the Sun Deck with IceBath and what must be Bali's best sauna view. Cannot wait to go again","Absolutely mesmerized by my experience at Lago Beach House in Nusa Lembongan!

Upon arrival, I was immediately captivated by the panoramic vistas of the pristine beach that stretched as far as the eye could see. Nestled perfectly on this serene coastline, Lago Beach House boasts an ambiance that is both elegant and intimate.

Kudos to Lago's dedicated staff, who ensured my comfort throughout and went above and beyond to make my stay extraordinary. If Nusa Lembongan is on your travel list, Lago Beach House is the epitome of luxury and relaxation. I'm already marking my calendar for a return visit!","Oh, what an absolute gem of a place! Our recent stay at Lago Beach House was nothing short of a dream come true! We had the pleasure of staying for two glorious nights, and we can't stop raving about it.

First and foremost, let's talk about the Beach House itself. From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the stunning views. The location couldn't have been more perfect ‚Äì right on the beach with the gentle sound of the waves as our soundtrack. The interior was beautifully decorated and exceptionally clean. The attention to detail was remarkable, and it truly felt like a home away from home.

What made our stay even more memorable were the little touches, like the beachfront sundeck where we could relax on the day beds and soak in the sun, or enjoy the sauna and ice bath. We had literally a front-row seat to some of the most breathtaking sunsets we¬¥ve ever witnessed!

In conclusion, we can't praise Lago‚Äòs Beach House enough. This truly exceeded our expectations, and we left with a heart full of wonderful memories. If you're looking for a paradise getaway in Nusa Lembongan, look no further than ""Lago."" We can't wait to return and relive this fantastic experience!

Thank you to the entire team at ""Lago"" for making our stay so incredible!"

Room was nice, had good air conditioning, and comfortable bed. It is located on the water, but there is no beach. The infinity pool overlooks the water so having to beach wasn‚Äôt a big deal for us. Breakfast was amazing and the service was just as great! Not very walkable just because it‚Äôs so hot outside and roads are narrow but there are around 10 restaurants that will pick up and drop off for free from the hotel if you don‚Äôt want to rent a bike. Host set up all our meals easily.","Horrible experience.  Not as advertised.  Does not look like the booking app at all.  You MUST have a scooter, so out of the way from everything.

We booked 4 nights, showed up, looked at the place... And wanted to cancel.    Its a dump!.  Kitchen was filthy.  No decor.  Place is falling apart.,

The ""beach"" is non existent.  Only rocks.  The dirt area that appears to   be beach isn't.

So when we respectfully tried to cancel, we were told we would have to pay 2 nights in CASH.  When when we protested, the man threatened to call the police!!!  I told him to do it!!  He was just threatening.

The man was argumentative, and threatening,  we paid the 50 percent plus 3 percent service charge... And left promptly.  You've been warned!!

We found a great place in town on a real beach.  Accessible to stores and without needing to rent a bike","We really loved our stay here. It is very suitable for people who prefer secluded and quiet. Bungalows are situated at the end of walking path on the edge of small community with 1 warung, 1 convenience store, 1 scooter rental, 1 spa. Everything you need is there but probably not enough for people who want to socialize or stay out late. The warung has great food. Breakfast at hotel was varied and plentiful. The staff and the owner are very hospitable and helpful. We really liked the walk along the shore to the main harbor. Takes about 20 minutes and is dotted with restaurants, bars and secluded beaches. The hotel does not have a sandy beach at front but you can swim/snorkel or walk maybe 100 m along the shore to a beautiful beach. You can also walk about 15 mins on the road to Mushroom Bay that has a lot of amenities and large beach. It is a lot busier area.  You can also take day trips arranged by the hotel. We spent a week there just lounging around pool and taking scooters out to circle both Nusas. Beautiful islands, people and this hotel was a gem for us.",For my last days in Indonesia we decided to go to Nusa Lembongan because of the busyness of Nusa Penida. We have stayed in one of the ocean view rooms and are very positive. Seaside huts is located at the beach and does not have a lot of restaurants en hotels near its location. Because of the taxi service a lot of restaurants offer and the taxis on the island it was really easy to get around on the island. You are also able to snorkel and rent a scooter at the resort. We are very positive and would like to come back another time.,"We had the most beautiful and peaceful stay at The Seaside Huts. The brothers who run it are absolute legends. Kind, friendly and happy to help with absolutely anything you need. Also great to have a laugh with and made us feel very welcome and at home for our stay. Our room was very tidy and a good size, it was also cleaned everyday.
The location is in a very quiet spot, which we loved. A short walk into the main town along the water front was a breeze. The pool overlooking the ocean made for some lovely warm days. Thank you sea side huts. We look forward to returning soon."

Family run hostel that go above and beyond. Booked cheap taxis for us! Got the best deals on ferry transport. Gave us scooter lifts as my friend had an accident. Constantly gave really helpful advice for day trips and locations. Such friendly lovely people. Jam and toast breakfast was gorgeous with tea and coffee. Rooms were massive with two bathrooms for every 4 people! Room has great aircon. Beds were comfy. Only flaw I would say is location. Tourist places are 15-20 minute walk away like beaches, devils tear etc. If you can ride a scooter, location is perfect because it gives you a chance to ride. Everywhere is 5 minute scooter away!","Overall a good hostel. Owner provides a small breakfast consisting of toast and jam as well as some fresh watermelon. He was very helpful with the scooter rental as well. The place is realy beautiful and comes with a few friendly dogs and a feeling of being right in the nature.
The rooms are very spacious and come with two bathrooms for 4 people which is amzing. However the rooms are very dark and have a lot of moskitos and no curtains. However the owner can provide a moskito net, which is a must on that place.
The location is decent with nice restaurants nearby and with the scooter you will be everywhere vey quick. Without scooter not a good location.
For budget travelers a decent place
I would recommend.
PS: the owner is very helpful but could work on a smile from time to time :)","Great place to stay in Lembongan! Very quiet area, between the two main point of interests of the island which makes it a great place to stay! The owner is a sweet heart! No pool but greenery around and nice balconies in front of the room to rest after a long day! Would totally recommend this place!","Calm, lovely hostel on Lembongan. Made, the host is super helpful & sweet. Rooms are clean and spacious. Will definitely be back when I visit the island again. He serves some breakfast and dropped me off at the harbor ü§ó.

You could rent a scooter from him, or book trips as well!

We booked a room with a queen size bed on the second floor, upon check in we were told that all rooms on the second floor were ""Family suites with living room"" and did not match our reservation, but the photos clearly showed our room on the second floor.
We were put in a twin room at the entrance in full view of all the guests, even though we had booked a queen size bed.
The room we were given had only one towel instead of two and the hot water did not work. When I explained to the manager that the hot water was needed because I had a cold/flu, I was told, and I quote: ""you are the first to complain about the lack of hot water and local people generally wash with cold water"". When I asked for a refund, the manager (or owner) got worried and took me to the SECOND FLOOR where there was a free room with hot water and a queen size bed! At the same time he was rude and asked me in a sarcastic way if I was finally satisfied with the water temperature.
The quality of wifi in the room was not even enough for whatsapp
Mold everywhere
Torn old linens
Plumbing fixtures/faucets had apparently never been changed
Motorcycle parking lot was closed every morning by a car belonging to the hotel and it was impossible to get out
They didn't give us a key to our room
The water is salty (sea water) in the shower.
The glass on the shower door is dirty
No drinking water in the room or at reception
No toilet paper
