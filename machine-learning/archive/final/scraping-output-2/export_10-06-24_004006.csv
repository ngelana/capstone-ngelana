ChIJGwy2RkwR0i0REpVO8_XJUNI,Aan Secret Waterfall,-8.5139213,115.38426889999998,"Aan, Banjarangkan, Klungkung Regency, Bali 80716, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=15154834804287902994,OPERATIONAL,+62 857-9282-1748,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.8,367,,"A beautiful place, would definitely recommend coming here. Getting to the waterfall is an adventure, walking down the steps and into the gully. Beautiful cliffs lined with lush vegetation with the sun shimmering through. You walk the along rocks and sand, definitely getting your feet wet. We did it in flip flops no problems but if you have water shoes they would be great. Just absolutely beautiful and we had the whole place to our selves. There is a little pool at the base of the waterfall about ankle deep, so not much for swimming but you can stand underneath it and feel the power.
We met the lovely couple in the Cafe area back at the top, and had rice cakes with veggies in a peanut sauce, a variety of local crisps and the pandan pancakes with coconut. It was very delicious! We had a good chat to the owner and founder of the waterfall and he told us how he found it.
It's a donation box and we definitely recommend donating a bit as so much work has gone into making the waterfall accessible.
This is a must do if you want a fun adventure without the tourist hoards.","Awesome place for true explorers. This place requires some hiking skills and you have to walk barefoot or with swimming shoes, but it's definitely worth it. The canyon path is the thing here. Waterfalls are ok, but path is amazing. You rarely see this kind of places. Cons: there's lot of spiders and path is slippery.",This place is a must stop. Definitely the best waterfall experience we have had here in Bali. The walk through the gorge is beautiful and you are rewarded at the end with a stunning waterfall. We had the place to ourselves . Owners are very nice and friendly. Can't recommend stopping at this place enough.,"What an experience it was! I mean, total mind-blowing. To see two waterfalls, you have to walk in the canyon. I recommend doing it barefoot to feel a connection to the earth and nature. It's a bit challenging but totally worth it—a true hidden gem with no crowd whatsoever. There is no entry fee, but you can donate some money for the founder and his projects","Recently discovered waterfalls, reachable through a short walk through a beautiful gorge surrounded by excited birds and shy monkeys, to be met by three refreshing waterfalls at the end. Amazing experience amplified by the peace and quiet, I was totally alone and the owners wonderful story of how he found it and why wants to share this experience and his philosophy for free. Its a track that takes a bit of effort but worth any drop of sweat. Support the owner if you can, tell your friends."

We’re traveling around the island but didn’t even plan to stay at Dira’s home. We just came to see the waterfall but decided to spend several nights at the home stay.
Actually, that were the most inspiring and informative days! We had a deep dive into the Balinese culture, went trekking to see the sunrise, and even visited the local massage healer person.
This was the real adventure!
Suksima!","Wonderful days with Dira and Made in there house
So good food and great reception for our family, especially with the kids. Magical waterfall too!
Thank you Dira and Made",Good,,
