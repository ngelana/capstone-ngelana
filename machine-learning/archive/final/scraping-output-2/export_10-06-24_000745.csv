We really enjoyed having dinner there. The food was delicious and the watermelon juice was fresh.

The view in the morning is amazing","The food was lovely here, I had the enchiladas with jackfruit and it was absolutely amazing! One of the best meals I have had in Bali so far. The view is also absolutely stunning and the staff made us feel very comfortable and welcome. I really recommend this place","Amazing place!! It‚Äôs worth to visit this place for the Food(I had Enchilladas that were soo good!!) and the view.
A little bit more pricy. But worth every penny. Also great staff that made us feel very welcome and even gave us recommend for sightseen.","Absolutely wonderful place to eat. Highly recommend. The food is delicious, the views are great, and the people are phenomenal.","Very good food in a very beautiful spot! ü•∞

We highly appreciated having the aircon during the hot humid nights in Bali, much more comfortable than the picturesque bamboo villas on Instagram. The hut is cozy, cute, and super clean. At night we could hear the soothing sounds of the insects that were extremely calm for a good sleep. There are excellent restaurants nearby plus a long swimming pool within walking distance of the middle of the forest. Sadly we wanted to stay longer but cannot arrange with a short notice. The host family is super nice and helpful. Will definitely come back for a longer stay.","Best place we stayed in Bali. The Swiss owner took care of every detail. The wooden house is very cosy and has everything you need. Well equipped kitchen where you can cook your own food, a sofa to watch complimentary Netflix with comfort, med and sanitary kit in the bathroom. Extra towels for a pool. Perfectly working AC and absolutely the best bed with memory foam mattress that is extremely comfortable to sleep. We had an amazing breakfast brought to us from a nearby restaurant. The wifi worked well, enough for work and do video conferences. We can also recommend a driver with his car offered from the owner or option to rent a scooter. We wish we stayed longer.","I stayed at Rachel and Stephan's place for a month. I would love to come back time to time. I have to say it is one of the best place to stay. Not because how fancy it is, but the whole natural surroundings and the well built house itself. Before I booked, I hesitated a lot. Because  normally  the reality looks smaller than the picture. I was comparing between two options for few days. My doubts  were :This place is kind of far from Ubud and other area and what if it is too small. But everytime I look at the pictures, I have great feeling. So I booked and it proved well that I should always trust my heart.
When I arrived, they surprised me with the new built net in front of house which is perfect place for my meditation.
Rachel, Stephan and their cute daughter are so nice and helpful. We had a great talk and moment during silence  day.
My business revenue  increased a lot when I was there. It indeed has great energy.

The massage they recommended me was one of the best experience with open view and such reasonable price. The beach and rafting they suggested are super as well.
I highly recommend the place for a short or long term stay!","I was the first guest in August 2023, and stayed in the cottage. The hosts were lovely and couldn't help in anymore in making my stay very relaxing. The cottage had all I needed and was very peaceful and only a short work to restaurants. Highly recommend.","Kalamanthana must surely be the crowning jewel among homestays (if that is how its owners would like it to be categorised) in Bali and probably beyond the island. Built on a plateau in the East Bali village of Muncan, Kalamanthana enjoys a commanding view of tropical jungles stretching far into the distance to reach the Indian Ocean. With the majestic Gunung Agung towering into the sky behind it, Kalamanthana, in the eyes of Feng Shui believers, is blessed with the flow of positive energy.

Designed and built with loving care, Kalamanthana comprises a guesthouse called a Klumpu (Balinese barn) built of teak wood with a roof of clay tiles, and the owners‚Äô lovely wooden home next to it. Evidently, the owners Stefan and Rachel have given their every thought and seen to every detail in designing, building, equipping and furnishing the Klumpu and their own home as well as the beautiful gardens in the large compound. The Klumpu is highly functional with a well equipped kitchenette with an electric hob and other kitchen wares and a cozy den complete with a television with Netflix access and a comfortable sofa bed on the ground floor. Also on this floor is a bathroom and toilet in which there is every amenity a guest could need. The high pressure shower provides a reliable stream of hot water. The owners have taken care in selecting eco-friendly bathroom amenities and disposables. Detailed attention and quality is the hallmark of the Kalamanthana buildings and their surroundings. One would not expect anything less from a Swiss which is what Stefan is. Everything worked well, from a very efficient Wi-Fi to electrical points located where they are needed, to useful fixtures and furnishings. Also evident is the care with which Rachel has picked the furnishings right down to the highly comfortable foam mattress and bedlinen.

Conveniently located, Kalamanthana is within an hour from Sanur and Ubud. In fair traffic condition, it is  an hour and a half from Bali‚Äôs Ngurah Rai Airport. It is a hidden gem away from the bustling touristy parts of South Bali and Ubud. Neighbouring Desa Muncan (where Kalamanthana is located) is Sidemen. Together, the two districts abound with lush rice terraces and scenic landscapes. The environment is rural, with an atmosphere of tranquility and a relaxing peace.

A restaurant called Fluffy C and a local warung are barely ten minutes away by foot. Fluffy C offers a selection of delectable Italian and Mexican fares and the local warung serves delicious Indonesian meals. Both eateries will deliver meals from breakfast to dinner to guests at Kalamanthana. One cannot be more pampered. The owners also offer a concierge service including arranging tours and transportation, massage, river rafting and visits to waterfalls. There is a house handbook carefully curated with recommendations of activities including visits to the numerous waterfalls in the vicinity. All activities as I understand are specially selected with the owners themselves having experienced them.

I can safely congratulate Rachel and Stefan for setting a new benchmark for the quality of homestays. They have put much thought and care into this project of love with which they also offer the warmest hospitality to their guests. The love that they and their daughter Reyhan shower on their pets Dolly, Gretel and Hansel amply shows their capacity to care and give.

I have thoroughly enjoyed a four day stay at Kalamanthana and have no reservation to recommend the homestay to all."

Tucked away in a jungle paradise, this accommodation offered us an unparalleled experience of tranquility and natural beauty. The beautiful little villas offered breathtaking views that felt like something out of a fairytale. Waking up to the serene sounds of nature and the sight of verdant greenery stretching as far as the eye could see was truly magical.

The staff at Ecozy were simply the best, taking care of our every need with genuine warmth and hospitality. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with smiles and made to feel right at home. Their attention to detail and willingness to go the extra mile truly made our stay special. Special thanks to the owner of this beautiful place whose hospitality, mindset and friendship feels so natural. Thank you, Wira, for all your care and offering us special invitations to traditional ceremonies, your approach and the approach of your team went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was nothing short of perfect.

The food at Ecozy was absolutely delicious, with a variety of fresh and flavorful dishes to choose from. We looked forward to every meal, knowing that we would be treated to a culinary delight.

Overall, our experience at Ecozy exceeded all expectations. We left feeling rejuvenated, relaxed, and incredibly grateful for the wonderful memories we made during our time there. I cannot recommend this accommodation highly enough to anyone looking for a truly exceptional stay in a jungle villa paradise in Bali.

It's a place we'll always hold dear in our hearts, and we can't wait to return someday soon. ‚ô•Ô∏è","A beautiful hidden valley with a tasty restaurant at the top, secluded huts halfway down and a lovely pool further down. Stayed for a few days immersed in nature with butterflies, flying beetles, birds,  a pack of monkeys in the trees nearby and fireflies at night. The pool is great, although the edges of the platform are a little worn away.",Hidden gem! Insanly beautifull pool with extreme jungle vibes. Great food and drinks. Nice staff. Also for delivery.
