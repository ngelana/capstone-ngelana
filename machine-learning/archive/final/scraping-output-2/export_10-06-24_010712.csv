Special shout out to Piping, Opel and Fiki for being so welcoming to my parents, husband and I!
(Note that they also don‚Äôt have a restaurant but do work with an outside resto if you want food delivered)

Can‚Äôt wait to stay again:)","Amazing Stay! I would highly recommend staying here if you are coming to Nusa Penida. The staff was amazing, super helpful and super friendly. They were always making sure that we were ok and that we were happy. They went beyond their duties when it came to making us feel comfortable and well. The rooms were clean and well taken care of and the breakfast was great, nothing super special but well made.

We met with Pinping who greeted us as he road to our rescue on a scooter after a terrible day of bad hotels that leaked sewage and another losing our booking details.
Kompyang has the most luxurious looking rooms and bathrooms. The feel and look of the whole place just brightens your mood and really makes you feel welcome. I can't speak more highly of this accommodation it's a 11/10!","The room is big with interesting ""close to nature"" bathroom, the service is excellent. The manager looks like a Vietnamese celebrity ""Thai cong""

Highly recommend for a night stay there if you want to visit both the east and the west side of Nusa Penida.

I have deducted two stars for following reasons

1. I found a spider-web + spider in my room. This was clearly visible and should have been removed before our arrival.
2. We opted for their snorkeling package (tied up with Virgin Resort) which was not that great. 1 guide for 15 members on the boat - the guide did not explain anything and asked to jump in the water. Plus there was a cost variation - we gave IDR 250k per person Vs people from other hotel gave IDR 200K. (Maybe you can bargain at the hotel)
3. They charge 100k IDR for scooty which is slightly higher than market rate (70k to 80k IDR)
4. Pick up and drop service from Harbor - chargeable 100k IDR per pick up. (maybe this good enough, but i feel if i am taking pick up and drop both, then their own customer should get some benefit)

Rooms and pool was amazing with helping staff. Overall a good stay - would not recommend to book activities from them.","We stayed here for 3 days and the staff were soo kind! Rooms were clean! The staff members always had a smile on their face! Especially Margiana, Tila and Rasi!!
The location is perfect and you have so many neighbouring restaurants and spas!
There was also a cute little doggo that came to say hi!","Stayed there for two nights. Rooms were clean and cozy. Toilet close to the shower but it‚Äôs a common thing in Bali. AC and TV in the room. Unforfunately TV was not smart and additional TV box was not working at all.

Staff very welcoming and pleasant.

Environment and pool clean and well maintained. Breakfast and dinner from restaurant were delicious.

Closest beach shore were imposible to go swimming available only sunbathing. Because shore was full of rocks and in bad smell.","The rooms are clean and the territory is well maintained. We did not try the pool.
Why I put only 3 points - there is no option for vegan people who do not eat gluten for breakfast. Basically you have three options in the breakfast: fried eggs, omelette and pancake. So an option for vegans would be nice. Maybe a smoothie bowl or something else.
The tour what we did with them. We did not visit all the sights which were advertised in the tour.","The rooms are very nice and the bed is very comfortable, but if you book the room with bathtub you should know that you will probably not gonna be able to use it since the water pressure is very low on the island and the heating is a 50 or 60 liter tank.

Has a few villages near by and some nice beach clubs (the chill, cactus).
Place was just up a cliff off the main road so it was very peaceful, apparently for the anavoidable roosters.
Rooms were spacious, tall ceilings, AC and a large washroom and shower with good pressure, and a bidet.
There's a pool and sun beds available as well.
Owners were nice, accommodating and friendly. They offer transportation services, scooter rental and offered suggestions for things to see, have dinner at, etc, all very good.

Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting nusa penida","We stayed for 3 nights. The hotel is family owned, and the host Wayana and her staff is very polite and helpful people. The village is nice with friendly people. Nice and clean rooms with air con. Every room has a veranda. Lovely pool area. Great breakfast served on the veranda. We rented a scooter by the hotel 100k/day and it was delivered in 10 min. Most recommended!","This place and the host were fantastic! After bouncing around hostels for a few weeks, my friends and I decided to treat ourselves to a little more luxury in these cottages. We were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and the AMAZING breakfast. I would 100% recommend upgrading to include the breakfast as getting to the restaurants at the bottom of the hill seems like a lot of work when you want to relax in the morning.

A few things to note:
-The dragonfruit juice was amazing (and can be ordered at any time)
-It‚Äôs very easy to book a driver for the day through the hotel and it is quite cheap if you have multiple people. I don‚Äôt recommend booking a motorbike if you aren‚Äôt an experienced driver because the roads in Nusa Penida are hazardous with many potholes.
-The bathroom has a window to the outside, so mosquitos and other critters can get in quite easily. We just kept the bathroom door shut all the time to prevent it (and also to keep the AC in the bedroom), but that also meant the bathroom floor didn‚Äôt dry after showers because it was just exposed to humid air.","You will feel absolutely comfortable and safe at this family owned place. Wayan and her family are very cute and lovely people, who will take care of you. The rooms are clean, the pool has a nice view and Wayan can arrange everything for you (Manta trip, scooters etc.).

It was a pleasure to stay there because it wasn‚Äôt busy, so the swimming pool was kind of private.

The breakfast is standard, do not expect quality food. (The noodles are good though).

The room is missing thin curtains : Because of the lack of any other windows than the glass door, it‚Äôs either you let the curtains open and people will peak at your room (bed), either you close it and it‚Äôs pitch black. Also, the hot water is quite limited so expect lukewarm showers.

Also the location of the town where the hotel is is pretty far from every touristic destinations (south of the island), expect  50min rides to go there.

The scooter was VERY expensive to rent (120.000/day) but the condition was ok.

The staff is very friendly and helpful which made us feel good there.

The overall decoration of the lobby and the swimming pool is really beautiful.

Overall, a good hotel for the price.",Found this place on Air BNB. Room was spacious and clean with a good sized bed and en suite. They randomly clean your room some days and some days not.

I‚Äôd recommend the owners to put some extra shelves into the single rooms as there were no space to put clothes. As it is the homestay, owners are not available at all times, but when they are, they make absolute best effort into making your stay as comfortable, nice and pleasant as possible!","Comfortable, clean rooms, space to chill outside, great food at friendly prices and kind and thoughtful owners :) all amenities (supermarket, restaurants, massage) nearby",The owners are extremely helpful. They went out of their way to arrange transportation for me so that I could go scuba diving everyday. Even their breakfast was quick and delicious at the same time.,"We stayed in the homestay a few weeks ago as a group of friends and can honestly say it was such a lovely and comfortable place to stay. Cakra and his family were so welcoming and helped us with everything we needed, including a private tour around the island and taking us to the best snorkelling port. Would definitely recommend to everyone!"

Staff are friendly too! Took away the bagels, hope to be back to try other items on the menu.","Good for breakfast, freshly made, tasty, cozy place. request for halal options as they have available. they do sell Bacon and Ham but have separate utensils.","If you like great food, coffee and big smiles this is the perfect place to go! I recommend for breakfast or lunch! Super nice! Terima Kashi üôè","For the first time in asia delicious bread and pastries. We came back 3 days. Prices are very good as well.

We had pancakes these were great! Only the icecream was crystalized. We recommend the chocolate Berliner (nutella would make it even better). The cinnamon buns were also great.","Good selection of baked goods available here. Coffee is pretty tasty as well. Would highly recommend the Ham and Cheese Bagel, it doesn't say on the menu but it has cucumber, lettuce and tomato as well which was a nice surprise. The bagel was soft and fluffy and tasted very fresh"

‚ùåThe floors are dirty so you can‚Äôt walk barefoot,
‚ùå The shower has a broken head, the floors and walls are dirty
‚ùå The sinks have a sulfuric smell when in use
‚ùå The showers and toilets are inside the lobby, so when you come out in a towel, the street can see you, as can anyone in the main room of the hostel
‚ùå it‚Äôs very small, with a tiny sofa in the main room
‚ùå there are no windows in the bedroom
‚ùå  every surface and wall and handle was dirty, and I‚Äôm not a germaphobe by any means. Even the mirror about the sinks was full of water marks and toothpaste etc
‚ùå the light switch for the bedroom is in the main room, by the front door

That being said, the positives are
‚úÖ The workers were kind and polite
‚úÖ I was able to easily book a lift to the harbour
‚úÖ the lockers are big and can fit lots in
‚úÖ there is a changing area, though it‚Äôs just a curtain you pull across
‚úÖ the WiFi was good
‚úÖ they provide cooled water through a filter
‚úÖ It was safe, with keycard access and a key for your locker

I used this place just to sleep, and I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs there for. Don‚Äôt expect somewhere to relax in the day, go to Cactus Beach Club or The Chill which are just 8-10 mins down the road on a scooter!","I loved my stay in Write hostel! The staff is genuine, helpful and incredibly kind. I even got dropped off at the harbor for free! The beds are really comfy and so nice to have my own curtain. Big lockers too! The value for money is really good. I did not realize how much I had missed the intimate atmosphere of a living room where I can just chill on the couch with a cup of tea, until I arrived at this hostel. Thank you for making my stay the best!",Very nice hostel and the staff very friendly and kind. Very helpful staff. Close to many restaurants. It‚Äôs a 8 beds hostel so maybe difficult if you are a solo traveller to share activities (if you don‚Äôt drive) but found people.,"Very good hostel!! They only have one room so it‚Äôs a small hostel which makes it easier to get to know new people. The dorm is really clean and the beds are super comfortable. Friendly and helpful staff, you can rent scooters here.",This hostel wasn‚Äôt really what we expected but maybe we didn‚Äôt read enough reviews‚Ä¶ it only had 1 room of 8 and one tiny lobby. It smelt pretty bad which I think was a mixture of aircon and the toilets but it was quite inescapable. We decided to just stay 1 night instead of 2 as there‚Äôs not a lot to do in the surrounding areas. You can however rent a bike for about 70k a day which is cheap

Food is so good and tasty, so accommodating and understanding of my friend being coeliac too! We went back twice, 10/10 recommend!","This place is great but they seemed a little inattentive to people wanting to order but they came immediately when we nodded at them. The food was fabulous - satay squid and grilled prawns just excellent. Best meal in Bali so far. Cocktails were good - order 2 get 1 free was good except we go the wrong margarita but hey, first world problem. Vibe is great. Free live music. Highly recommend.",I was a bit apprehensive at first as there were no diners inside. I was so wrong! The food was amazing along with the cocktails! Highly recommend! :) The guys were super sweet too,We were too early for dinner and there's rarely anyone. Hence we didn't expect much. My grill chicken is good with char grill smell too. Nice ambience.

Staff are friendly and more than happy to assist. Rooms are older but clean and have shampoo, body wash and extras. Location is away from the main swimming beaches but near lots of food - supermarket, night market, stalls and cafes/restaurants. Uden was very helpful and attentive.","Major upgrade needed!

Aircons aren‚Äôt good enough for the heat.

No fan adds to the woe (on top of struggling aircon)

Sound from next cottage disturbs even when someone walks due to poor wooden flooring

Bathroom is a design disaster as bathroom area overlaps with closet & it‚Äôs all wet! A huge falls risk!

We made a mistake of staying in Daghan and Nusa Pineda. Wish we booked extra days either in Villa Anyelir in Seminiyak or Villa Sindu in Ubud which were class apart.","Nothing to say, the host was super nice, informed us about all the activities, and even accompanied us. As for the rooms, they were great. It's possible that there might be bugs or lizards, but we didn't encounter any. I recommend it.","A traditional yet contemporary hotel that seamlessly blends the charm of yesteryears with the conveniences of today. The room I stayed in was impeccably clean and well-organized, offering ample space and a delightful view of the pool area. The hotel thoughtfully provided all the essential amenities, ensuring a comfortable stay. Notably, all the facilities were in excellent working condition. What truly enhanced my experience was the warm and accommodating staff, with a special shoutout to Komang for going above and beyond to make my stay memorable. Highly appreciative of their hospitality!","One of best cottages in Nusa Penida. Excellent service and nice view with a unique appearance of its cottage.
Great place to chill either in swimming pool and or just sitting in front of the cottage, enjoying the view, after your trip around Penida."

You can reach them for anything quickly on Whatsapp. For breakfast you have a couple options including eggs, toast, banana pancakes, coffee, and tea. Be sure to rent a scooter to get around because this is further from the nicer beach front restaurants. Only downside is that there is limited hot water (might be a common problem around the island). Other than that, I can highly recommend this stay.",About 20 min ride from the main harbour to this lovely guesthouse. Amenities are close by. The beach is 2-3 min walk.,"Loved staying here!! The pool is BEAUTIFUL and everything was super clean. It was my partner and I's anniversary and they made a special message on our bed with flower petals!!! So romantic and the staff was so thoughtful and spent a bunch of time putting it together!!

Breakfast was included and super yummy!! I got coffee and a veggie omelette with toast! We went to the night market for dinner (which I highly recommend everyone do!) It's only a 15 min walk but the staff offered to drive us which is so sweet!

Highly recommend staying here and I would stay again next time!","I'd recommend the Kinton Guest House to everyone who's looking for a quiet place, still close to the beach and the harbors. The room was clean, quite spacious and we had access to a nice pool! The hosts were super friendly and helped us book a snorkelling-trip along the coast of Nusa Penida and even drove us to the harbor to catch our ferry."
