The rooms are spacious and clean, with a shared bathroom. Komang was an amazing host. He took us to a local restaurant for dinner, told us about the local waterfalls, rented us scooters, took us to his beautiful garden and arranged for us to have a Balinese cooking and cultural experience with his neighbour. Staying here was very special to us because we really felt welcomed. Thank you Komang for a great experience here.","I stayed not in the homestay but in their Abeona private villa. I can highly recommend it! Both the location is amazing, if you would like some peace and quiet time, with tons of waterfalls around the corner, and Sideman within 30 min reach. The owner is super lovely and takes care of anything you need. Oh yes, and the bonus, you have holy water coming from the tap here, straight from a local holy cave. Perfect stay to recharge! I would love to return one day.. :)","I had a fantastic stay at Undisan Guesthouse in the quiet village of Undisan. The location was off the beaten track, but still conveniently close to waterfalls, traditional villages, and temples. The family who runs the guesthouse treated me like one of their own and cooked delicious food that I was invited to enjoy with them. The room was immaculate, and the hot shower was a welcome comfort. I particularly enjoyed spending time in the beautiful garden. Overall, my stay was an authentic and unforgettable local experience. I highly recommend this guesthouse to anyone looking for a peaceful and welcoming getaway.","Wow, what a good surprise! This hotel was our best local experience in Bali. The room is clean, the garden is so peaceful, and there is a little outdoor kitchen with gas stove if you want to cook your own food, very useful. But the best part is the owner of this guesthouse, who wants to share his real balinese culture. He is so friendly, we spent all our afternoon/evening with him, because he shew us his beautiful realm, with the huge garden, we fed the farm animals, we tasted coconut from the tree, guava, and our first durian experience! He learnt us some balinese sentences and we spoke for hours, so interesting. Then he brought us to his friends and we stayed all the evening with them to learn how to cook the local tea and Lak Lak, the dessert speciality from Bali, and how to make an offering in their tradition and so many other things.
So if you are curious and want to learn a lot about this culture, you are in the right place. Again, it was our best experience and we will remember that for a long time!
Thanks again, matur suksma.","My stay at D‚Äôsari Undisan houses was the best I had during my one month travel in Indonesia. If you‚Äôre looking for a  local experience and the most lovely family, I strongly recommend this place. The private rooms are big enough for 2 people and have everything you need, the bathrooms are shared and are what you pay for but beside that, everything was perfect. I was supposed to stay 3 nights and extended 2 extra nights as I felt a part of their family and didn‚Äôt want to leave them. I‚Äôll be back for sure next time I come to Bali. Don‚Äôt look further and book with them if you want to live the best local experience with these amazing people :)"

The family is all welcoming and make you feel right at home. You get to be part of the everyday life and if you visit around a holiday, they even invite you to join them for the ceremonies. The family is lovely and super kind; always offering you food and treats. I stayed in both rooms and they‚Äôre comfortable and spacious, with private bathroom. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!","I expect at least a good breakfast from a homestay, not painted rice with unhealthy corn syrup. The price for the fan room was disappointing, especially considering that rooms with a view of rice fields were available for the same amount just 20 minutes away. The bed was comfortable, but the limited wifi, which didn't load many websites at all, was a downside. Overall, I wouldn't call it a homestay; it felt more like a tourist trap.",Minimalist room.  Suitable for spending the night.  Very bad connection.  At 6 am the roosters and dogs crow.  The owner is nice.  There are no direction signs.  The toilet is shared.,"A place where you get the feeling how they live on Bali. Very nice host that speaks English and French. Does everything to make you feel home. Room and bathroom were clean but very basic, no airco. Food was good but a lot.","Easy to find, down a quiet side street. Large, clean room with big (king-size), comfortable bed & natural light from 2 windows. Clean shower room (with hot water), toilet & adjoining sink were not en suite but were right next door to the bedroom and private for my use only. The host family were lovely, really hospitable, offering coffee & tea and bringing me fruit and Balinese treats throughout my stay. The main host, Komang, speaks excellent English & French & knows a lot about Bali & local sights. They helped with easy scooter rental & restaurant suggestions & onward car transfer. It was great to hire a scooter to get around the area & visit Besakih Grand Temple (about 25 mins away) & nearby Cepung waterfalls too. Would definitely stay again."

Always smiling and greeting us, he picked us up from Kuta and we made way to his home, where we stayed for two nights among his extended family. We dressed up, ate and prayed with his family. He would explain the cultural nuances whenever we went to the temples with him as well. In the evenings we jammed out while he played the Guitar. Dex is fluent in English and French as well.
