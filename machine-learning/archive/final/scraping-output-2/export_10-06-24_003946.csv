Jeff and his team are amazing and every single person went out of their way to make us feel welcomed and special. The villas were clean, modern and luxurious. The view was spectacular and the food was delicious.  Staying 4 nights was definitely not long enough.  Thank you, Jeff and your whole team.  I will be back!","Capung Asri Eco Resort has left me speechless. The moment you walk into the doors you are greeted with an abundance of beauty that will have you in awe for your entire stay. The luxury and relaxation the room presents you with was unmatched throughout my entire stay in Indonesia. Complete privacy upon entering my room made me feel truly at home and allowed me to enjoy all the amenities and fully be at peace. You can tell so much thought was put into every inch of this resort, everywhere you look from the amazing tile work and statues in the pool all the way to the breathtaking art all throughout the villa. Highly recommend you indulge in the floating breakfast , the perfect way to start your day on the right foot. Jeff and the team have truly outdone themselves and made this an experience I will never forget. Also Dragon is so sweet. Miss him already. Can't wait to come back :)","Capung Asri is simply stunning. From the moment you walk in, you instantly feel good. The amenities smell great and feel luxurious. Iâ€™m sensitive to scent and I could not get enough of all the scents around us. If you have time, the massage they offer is absolutely worth it. They were so good and I left feeling very relaxed.

The whole team truly elevates the experience. All of them are very professional, friendly and the most helpful! Tucked away outside Ubud central, the views are beautiful and relaxing. I could not have asked for a better place to relax.","Very nice quiet place outside touristic Ubud. Villa was very spacious and new. Had everything you could possibly think about including bath bombs, yoga equipment, mosquito repellent and even hats to protect from the sun. The staff is friendly and helpful. And Dragon is absolutely adorable.","We had the most incredible stay here. Jeff and his team went above and beyond to ensure we were taken care of and extremely comfortable in this villa. Iâ€™ve never experienced luxury like this before. We loved the villa so much we didnâ€™t even want to leave. The area is private but still just a short 20 minute drive into Ubud. The beds were so comfortable and the room was spacious. We had a private pool where we enjoyed a floating breakfast one morning which I would highly recommend. Out of our whole time in Bali, our experience at this villa was a highlight and we made memories that will never be forgotten. Thanks again to Jeff and his team!"

Not just in a Bali. Villa is just perfect. But what makes it so special is Putu Susie, who is so kind and always smiling. She made a welcome drink for us, prepared our breakfasts with love. I loved discusions with her. She is also super nice to our kids.

We already miss you! And the villa! It is a small paradise in the middle of the rice fields with all the privacy and calm you need. And still just few minutes ride from Ubud.","This place is such a beautiful and relaxing place. The host Putu Nik, is the best host I have had the pleasure working with. His whole family that owns/runs this place are phenomenal... from cooking, cleaning, driving, massage. Just Excellent",A good place to short stay n vocation with family,"First of all, beautiful villa in a peaceful context surrounded by rice fields. It is located in a village not far from Ubud, in my opinion the best city in Bali. What really stood up was Putu's figure: always kind, friendly, she would personally make breakfast for us everyday in the villa, amazing and delicious. She also let us rent a scooter for a very good price and any need we had she immediately responded. Amazing host. The day of our departure she made for us some good local food to take away to the airport, simply unbelievable, and her husband took us directly to the airport. We really felt home. The villa itself is very nice, perfect for long stays, too.",A great place to relax and excellent service.

I really loved the yoga platform (yoga matts complementary!) in the upper level of the house. And of course the hammocks, spend hours there just reading and enjoying the peaceful environment. The villa even has access to a magical river which we really enjoyed. Wayan even organised us scooters for us and a massage in the villa, which was awesome. In the villa were very helpful travel advisors for Ubud, Bali and Indonesia and traditional clothes (Kabaya & Sarongs) which we needed to enter a temple - very helpful if you travel light and don't want to buy it. Make sure you go on the complimentary village tour - so worth it! We would have never see these great places otherwise. We were riding our scooters every day, but there was a shuttle service twice a day which is great for people who like to travel around by car.",Villa Damee Is a private residence.
