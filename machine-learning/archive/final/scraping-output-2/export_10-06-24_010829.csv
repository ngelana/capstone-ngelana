Prompt and efficient: The hotel staff were quick to respond to any requests or concerns. They ensured that everything was taken care of promptly and efficiently, which made my stay more enjoyable.

Friendly and welcoming: The hotel staff greeted me with a warm and friendly attitude, creating a welcoming atmosphere. Their positive demeanor made me feel at ease and added to the overall positive experience.
The names mentioned above; mbak Sinta, Edin, Kak Monic, Kak Sandi (Manager)I paid for 6-7 days for a specific suite room and
apparently i was told that i had to shift to a room in the hostel to make up for it as they dont have a room to spare.
Kinda ridiculous how they managed guests around without even informing in advance. Worst is that i didnt even get a refund to make up for that last day.
The place dont deserved to be called as hotel. Rooms weren't clean either way, perhaps the owner doesnt even bother about the management i guess","Had an amazing time here. Tari & Intan were super friendly and helpful. I stayed in the room with a balcony, the room was spacious, the bed was comfy, and the area was calm. However the bathroom could use some improvements.","""Staying at this hostel was an absolute delight! From the warm welcome at check-in to the cozy atmosphere, every moment was enjoyable. The facilities were clean and well-maintained, and the common areas were perfect for meeting fellow travelers.I highly recommend this hostel to anyone looking for a comfortable and affordable stay in Bali !""

""I cannot speak highly enough of the amazing staff at this hostel! Stuff name Mr Sundi , Mrs Monic  and Mrs Mentari , Their exceptional service and genuine hospitality made my stay truly memorable. From offering valuable local tips to going above and beyond to accommodate my requests, they consistently exceeded my expectations. Their friendliness and willingness to assist created a warm and welcoming atmosphere that truly enhanced my experience. Thank you to the incredible team for making my stay unforgettable!""","I wish i could stay long term in this place.. so homey, chill and peaceful.

i booked a room, when i would like to check in early i ask theres a room available but they told me to check in at 2 pm, ok, i leave for an hour to brought a meal, when i am back to check in my room that i booked, they handed over to someone else.

I looked around in the room and felt disgusted. I have never ever had such a room. It is worse than on the photos(my camera is Not the best).
The mirror was dirty, the towel for the feet was partly Black, the nightstand was lying on the floor, the walls were dirty, but the bathroom was the worst. It was moldy everywhere, water lime and dirt in the toilet and all around the Tiles. This has not been cleaned for a while.
The good thing: I said I wanted to leave and the man called the manager and they gave me back my money.
I cant understand all these good ratings.","Bath room smelly.  The bed sheet was never change eventhough I stayed 5 days. Also the interior is not good, drawer is broken already.","Rooms can be small

Some hotels may not be as clean as others

Service may not be as consistent across all hotels

There have been some reports of fraud and scams related to OYO bookings

I definitely do t recommend!","The room is clean and decent. The staff is also friendly, but not so helpful. I was traveling with my mom abd 8-month baby bringing some luggage, but none of them helped me when I was about to check out. The breakfast was awful, you either get instant noodle, a piece of omelette, or two pieces of pancake and toast. It was also pretty far from some restaurants. There was only a fried chicken restaurant and two small shops in the neighborhood. But, if you only look for a place to stay the night for work or business, it is worth the price.","I booked last minute and the staff said room was ready. But went to the room, there was no soap and even toilet paper
Bathroom was dirty. But the room itself was good","Stay here for 2 nights and it was amazing, and the only problem is the room is little bit smelled of cigarettes smoke.

I told them that they could have tried calling to inform me via my local number that was in my booking and they could've called to ensure that I knew but again, he shrugged off responsibility.  As a solo traveling female, I feel that the hotel and its manager could have minimally helped me in looking for another accommodation instead of just stranding me outside their hotel.

Would never recommend this hotel. I can't imagine if I had a child or elderly with me on a family holiday.","I don't think I can find such a clean place at this price.

I'm going back here","Cove Ransha Stay Bali is a great option for budget-minded travelers looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay near Sanur. The property is clean, well-located, and has friendly staff. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great value for money in Bali","Super loud room near the streets with dogs barking at night. Bad odour in washroom.

Sprayed baigon or other bad smelling chemicals in the air before check in. I got allergic

I was requesting 2 times for the quiet room and when I checked in, I was given the loudest room instead.

At night lights on second floor outside are switched on. And staff don't want to turn it off, the curtains are not fully covering the window, so the room is full of light at night from the outside, this is aweful.

During the rain the rooftop leaks in the room on 2nd floor.

When the weather is windy, the doors are shaking and it is very loud.

Hot water finishes in a few minutes after starting using it.","I'm obsessed with this hotel! It's wayyy beyond my expectation, I even got a sunset view at my balcony! I booked it on agoda and i got a really good deal, when i first got there, I was amazed by the facility (free flow water, electric kettle, dental kit, Netflix!, stabil internet, room service) and hospitality! I can say it's the best budget hotel that I've ever visited! The staffs are lovely, the atmosphere is super calm and perfect, the room is super clean and comfy. I stayed for a week and I got no complaints at all (oh! I think they have a curfew at 11 pm but the staff will open the door if you call them) Please keep up the good service!
