And the food and guides were also good!,Very fun and adventurous trail with scenic views of the paddy field and river! Our guide was very good at capturing the memories on camera and he ensured our safety throughout the trail. May be a little challenging for a beginner but it gets better as you get used to handling the ATV. Highly recommended!,"We had one group not be able to do the course so ATV Bali kindly grabbed another staff member and both got to have the experience as passengers. Had a ball, was even more fun due to a big storm overnight so lots of water","This ATV track is very good for family, some track a little bit difficult but the guide and helper always ready to help.

Their guides were all super attentive and caring.

Howeverrrr, this is definitely not for first timer. My friend fell the first slope down üòÇ ATV flip side ways but he was lucky to only get some scrap on his elbow. I was behind him and that traumatize me. Every slope down subsequently becomes a huddle for me. My friend also opt to be a rider inside of a driver. Since, I was still very scared, lead guide was very smart to place me first in line. He guided me throughout especially when I get stuck at super tight turns.

Eventually, I gave up my atv to another friend whose atv ran out of fuel. I, too, became a rider üòÇ every up and down slope I would close my eyes and repeated ask for the guide to go slower.

Overall, I would recommend this to anyone WITH PRIOR EXPERIENCES. Prior experience means those atv with up and down slope. This is definitely not for the faint hearted!!!",Had a lot of fun! Personalized ATV experience with superb guide! Didn‚Äôt know there‚Äôs a technique to riding. First timer and had a blast. Suitable even if you have a baby in tow (they will give you the safe route),Having so much fun! The ATV track is challenging. The staff also nice and helpfull. Recommended!,"Great experience! My hubby had a blast, for me, it was hard to get use to, would need lots of practice. Fun!",One of the best excursions we did in Ubud!! Lots of fun and very safe! We went at 8am to beat the crowds. Would highly recommend as no other quads on the track!

Helpful staff.
We stayed there for 5 nights with our one year old. It was beautiful and everything was right.

Rooms are cleaned daily and we stayed in the Hibiscus Room which had shared kitchen which was always available. View from the room is good.

In many of the reviews it is mentioned jungle view which can sound scary and misleading. It was not a jungle as such but greenery was so dense that is looked like that. We felt safe even when we came back late at night.

Only one flaw-We had our own utensils but one suggestion to Eka- the cookware in shared kitchen was not clean and not up to the mark. If someone needs to use it, it can be difficult.","Amazing place, very pretty. Location wise it's a bit far from the attractions, but that might just be what you want? The caretaker was very helpful and accommodating. My room has kitchen + appliances in front of it. Very recommended if you're okay with the location.","The place was amazing. Well maintained & equipped. Owners are wonderful, responsive and helpful. Really felt like home. Location was great too. We really enjoyed our stay.","Loved it here. Felt like our little home.
Quiet and outside the city but prefer that way. The ride in is nice if you go a certain way.
Lovely host and the caretakers were really nice. Even took us to a special ceremony that happens once every 5 years. Has everything you need and they'll go out of their way to look after you.
Thank you Eka, Ketut, Wayan and Kadek","The place is amazing, we stayed there for 5 days and 4 night and we were very enjoy it every day. Rooms are very clean, and have great view to small valley.

Every morning we walked down to rice field, small forrest with small river. The neighbors also very friendly.

Most of them all, the owner is very nice and kind. Every day he took care of us, even till our last minute there. Thank you so much, Pak Sum for your hospitality.

Ps, Pak Sum is also maestro of stone carving. All his work are master piece. Do visit his humble gallery in his home, just 2 minutes walking from KeongSari."
