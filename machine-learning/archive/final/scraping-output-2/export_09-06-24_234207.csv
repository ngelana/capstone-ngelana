We were greeted with a cup of tea and some delicious kusurabi (small pancakes with coconut)! Then had a tour of the lab and learnt more about fireflies life cycle and threats to them. We then had a tour of the organic farm and picked some food for dinner while exploring the rest of the village. The dinner was incredible and delicious and completely vegan. Had such a wonderful evening and the best evening I had in Ubud.,"We don’t stay here but we did the firefly conservation tour which included a tour of the organic farm, learning about their farming practices, visiting the lab, a hands on cooking experience, and watching the fireflies. Staff were wonderful, very friendly and accommodating for different dietary requirements.",Very unique. People who work there have real dedication for ecosystem and sustainability and fireflies. We was really lucky that we find this place.,"I visited this camp for fireflies because it operates firefly lab and firefly conservation. The spot is very remote, middle of the woods, and very natural and quiet. We ordered mie goreng and nasi goreng and they were so delicious! (only 50k each) They are so welcoming and enthusiastic about fireflies and nature. I highly recommand this place especially for all families with children!","I found this is fascinating. A beautiful place with green environment in the heart of Bali Island that offers great hospitality, sustainble development activities, conservation of fireflies endeavour and a learning spot. This is a destination for photograhers, ornithologist, bikers, travellers, campers, scientist, yogi or just a mere vagabond. Just take a walk."

This was amazing. We had lunch afterwards and stopped half way round for a coffee all in the price.
Cause j would recommend this place to anyone. It was great our guide was so friendly.","It was just fine just like all other ATV adventures in bali.
Too expensive for the ride. Spent around 1.5 hours which included 20 mins coffee break and was charged 90 USD.
Staff were really nice.
Only day to get maximum out of ATV is when it rained. Track will get muddy and it would make the experience interesting. Otherwise in normal days its just like riding a motorbike in a village.","I was 2 weeks ago and it's supper fun! me and my friend we riding ATV, 7 km and finish in 1 hour 3o minutes. :)","We had the best time ATV riding with Taro Adventures. Our guide made us feel safe, safety equipment was provided and adequate. Our guide went above and beyond our expectations. We can't wait to come back again!",Great adventure. Was really tucked away. They should have proper Bali house tours and activities within the homes. The track should be more expanded. Overall it was still great!
