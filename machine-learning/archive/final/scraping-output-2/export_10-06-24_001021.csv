I went as part of the quadbiking deal, so was very quiet until the evening. The food was really good considering it came free with doing the quadbiking. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend the loaded potatoes however.","Very tasty food, but the we had 2 issues

1) the Mains as part of our tour lunch was seriously tiny portion sizes, perhaps like a small side - photo attached.

2) When we settled the bill, they bought incorrect (short change) 3 times back, and only upon showing persistent displeasure we  were given the correct change back.

The food quality was good, the atmosphere was quite nice, the view of the paddy fields & a good swimming pool - but over all for us it wasn‚Äôt a pleasant experience owing to the above two.","The atmosphere is chill, poolside beds were amazing, the rice dishes got that local flavour. We ordered pizza during the soak in the pool. Yes we ate in sofas in the pool too. Rice fields see till infinity during sunsets . I recommend this place for the solo traveller and families too. Enjoy the true Bali relaxing atmosphere. ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞","Love this Beach Club . The staff were excellent, always with a smile and a greeting, and were ever willing to help. Cretya Sunset Club is the perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. I really enjoyed there . Will surely come again . Highly recommended üôèüèª","Nice place to hangout, the view was awesome. The swimming pool
to chill out and yes they have hot whirl pool, which is nice. BUT if you have bad knee, totally not recommended to go to this cafe there are lots of stairs and some need big step. Children must under adult supervision all the time, Food and drink was okay, pricey enough for a cafe."

The villas are really nice, there are bay windows all around the room, and you are right in the middle of rice fields! Breakfast is very good!! and the pool surrounded by the garden and the rice fields is gorgeous!
Plus you're away from the crowed!! Definitely recommended","CONS:
- No AC
- There are spaces between the wall and the roof which is open so insects can get in the villa

PROS:
I really loved the location of villas and design and decorations, They are really great.
In addition, All the staff are so good and friendly and helpful.
Just if these problems above were solved, Villas would be so perfect!","Very beautiful place, the bungalows are georgious and romantic, huge shower. Super nice welcome, friendly people.

Please add vegan options to the menu, there are so many delicious local dishes with tempe and tahu in Indonesia! Unfortunately, there were no options on your menu. If you would offer some, we would have loved to have breakfast and dinner at your place too!

Also, please take care of the cats that are around the villas. There are young cats around and as they don't get fed propperly, they constantly beg for food while eating there. We were there in November though, so the cats might have grown and could be hunting for their own food now.

Otherwise super nice place to stay!","Paradise!

No AC, it's like you sleep in nature, just 1 small fan, still it's cold and blanket is needed.
Wifi is good, service is great.
Location is wow!!

Stayed there for 1 night, wanted to stay for a month.

There is very very nice pool club 200 mtrs from this hotel.","I really loved the place. We spent 2 nights here and we felt very relaxed . Great beds , relaxing view of the paddy fields which you can enjoy from the 3 floor to ceiling glass sides of the villa . Don‚Äôt worry there‚Äôs  blackout curtains should you wish to close it  The staff were humble and efficient.
The architecture is beautiful. Balinese style but modern in a way that the floors and walls are solidly built so you feel secure and the creepy crawlies from the surrounding greens can‚Äôt easily go in. This was a concern for me as I love the greens but I don‚Äôt want lizards and frogs sharing my roomüòÖ There were no mosquitoes too.
Beautiful sunrise and sunset views. I enjoyed watching the ducks and the chickens in the rice field. You can also see farmers working in the rice field.
Cons : food is limited but ok and portions are light. It was good for me but if you‚Äôre a heavy eater you need to order extra .
It‚Äôs far from the center . So it‚Äôs a nice rural village with some stores selling crafts. Nothing too commercial. To get to the center there‚Äôs a free shuttle on schedule or you pay for a taxi via the hotel."

The room looked really nice and the extra bed decorations were really enjoyed!
The food was also very nice
What we really didn‚Äôt like was the gym
Firstly, we were told the gym opened at 8 am which wasn‚Äôt true, at 8:30 finally someone came there but still didn‚Äôt open until 9
Then the gym itself‚Ä¶ it was really dirty, dusty, the barbells were slimy and it stank horribly inside
We were really disappointed with this, it a location you don‚Äôt even want to be in

During our stay there were some very loud visitors, blasting music and karaoke at 6 am - I‚Äôm not saying the staff is responsible for that, but some ground rules about what visitors are allowed to do would be really nice to ensure everyone is having a good time","Great experience. So impressed with how kind and helpful the staff were. They accommodate any request or help that you need. The rooms are also beautiful- much better than I had expected. It is also a nice location as it is out of the busy centre of Ubud, but also only 15/20 minutes away. Special mention to one of the staff Gun who helped my slightly clueless first-solo-travel !","Thank you for providing a memorable experience while staying here. I booked a private villa, I really like the room and the atmosphere is not noisy, But when I checked in, the room smelled bad and the trash hadn't been thrown away, the TV and stove didn't work either. My advice is to carry out quality control every time you clean a room. thank you üëåüëå","One of the best places l've stayed. 11/10 for me!
Exceptional bliss. (Everything was perfect! The staff is helpful and kind, everything is always clean, the villa is amazing in its beauty, Can't wait to visit again. Extremely sad to be leaving.
Thank you"" goon ""the manager of the villa

A screenshot will help us better understand your feedback.","I have to be so grateful for accidentally found this villas on the internet. THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE!

I stayed here April last year. I chose to stay in their private villa which got it in super affordable price for kind of a private villa + a private pool! (that's why I'm so grateful).
Our private villa located in the corner of this area, so to get there we need to go through the pathway that give us a beautiful scenery of the ricefields and ponds. The staff were humble and willing to escort us and ask to bring our bags.

This private villa facilitated with quite spacious room, bathroom, kitchen-set, sidepool sun bed, mini bar, TV. Unfortunately this room isn't coming with an AC, but based on my experience you won't get in heat/being so hot in the room as at night the temparature will a bit cold.

This place just give me sooo much refresh as our room facing the green ricefields. In addition, if we have a look behind the wall we can see a small ditch which its flow give me a sooting sound!

This place just unforgettable for me!  Would love to visit this again in the next occasion."

What a dream. The room we got was at the bottom so a bit of a walk but oh so worth it! The scenery was beautiful. Our room faced the little forest and it was just nice and breezy. No need for an aircon and had a mosquito net around the bed. We had mosquito coils we bought as well just to be safe but otherwise was such a comfortable stay. We booked for a Queen bed but actually got a big King Bed which was a nice touch.

Only downside was, I'm guessing with the humid weather - the curtains had mould on it and the net smelt a little of mould. Otherwise, seriously recommend if you're after some peace, quiet and scenery.

There's a restaurant that serves traditional meals and if breakfast is included, they give quite a decent portion. The staff are very lovely! Wi-Fi was great and allowed us to call home without issues compared to other Hotels.

Elephants weren't too far, not as many shops on this side but not a far drive either.","We reached the place by 9.30 night and was tensed little, thinking,oh god,where we have reached? But on entering inside, the tension reduced.The rooms are good. Bathroom is openüòä and the surroundings are beautiful.
Good experience üëèüëèüëè","Located in in the north Ubud, this place offers serenity and tranquility. The room is big, comfortable, and eco-friendly. The location is surrounded by greenery. Really suitable if you want to find an intimate atmosphere with Nature. The price is reasonable. The parking lot is very limited and the restaurant doesn't have many options.","I came few times here and I've seen the evolution from when it was still under construction (only few rooms where already finished and ready for operation) and now where everything is done.. damn it's a place to be! Amazing view, rooms are facing a small jungle valley with a small river at the bottom. Its on different levels like rice terraces and everywhere it's like a big garden (flowers, trees, bushes, woods, ...)! Swimming Pool at the entry, yoga dojo, SPA area for massage and about 10 or 12 rooms. All the staff are really friendly! This place is great to ressource yourself with good energies, retreat, relax and disconnect from The World. My friend Made (Yoga) will take your breath away with his kindness and his beautiful aura and soul! He can help you with some life guidances if you want to.

We call it ""House of Happiness"" and it's definitely what you find when you stay there!

Will come back again and again! One of my fav place!

Suksema! üôå

Amazing since Day 1 and can't wait to spend the rest of our time here and come again."

I enjoyed my meal with a wonderful rice fields view.
