Or I should say the service was horrible! 1. No one ever answered phone call! 2. No reception and can‚Äôt find anyone for check in. 3. No hairdryer in the room. 3. No fridge in the room. 4. Even no hot water for shower! 5. The owner was the worst and laziest business owner I ever seen! Can‚Äôt even be bothered to tell you the wifi password and ask you to wait for the staff to tell you. 6. The nasty female owner will sit behind the breakfast table to watch you while you are eating.,Good stay for 2 nights. It's secluded. Restaurant service is just ok. Room is spacious. Common areas are beautiful. No other activities provided. Good place if you want to rest and go around Ubud,"Very rude manager (Hameda). Booked a room with private pool but it was totally opposite. Gave me a room with bad air conditioner. She refused to give me the room I booked. Also, she refused to give me a fan, on top of that I called her and she terminated the call.","I'd say this 4 star is equivalent to a USA 2 star hotel or lower. The staff was friendly and the room was pretty clean. However, keep in mind you can't flush toilet paper, the bathroom has a curtain for a door, there are no toiletries except for body wash and a toothbrush. Breakfast is included but it's not good and the coffee is this instant powder stuff that's really gross. Also the lighting in the room is terrible.","Security 0 attitude. Saya ga nginep disini, tapi saya orang lokal yg tinggal di dusun sini. Security always catcalling the local women. He has done it many times. Literally has zero attitudes.
I'm a hospitality person too. The owner should give more training to the staffs.
Im not sure he's a security or whatever, this person stand by on the pos near the road"

This place serves up some of the most delicious pork ribs I‚Äôve ever had. Their pork ribs are not just good; they‚Äôre exceptional. Tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection, these ribs are a must-try for anyone who appreciates good food.

Despite its amazing offerings, Warung Ajik Iga isn‚Äôt as crowded as you‚Äôd expect for such a high-quality eatery. This might be due to its relatively hidden location, so it‚Äôs still an undiscovered gem waiting to be explored by more food lovers.

The pricing is another delightful surprise. You get great value for what you pay, making it a perfect spot for anyone looking to enjoy excellent food without breaking the bank.

One suggestion for the restaurant would be to enhance the visibility of their banner outside. Adding some lights or a more noticeable sign could help more people realize that this incredible place is open and ready to serve. Initially, I mistook it for being closed due to the lack of lighting.

Overall, Warung Ajik Iga is a fantastic spot that I‚Äôd strongly recommend. If you‚Äôre in the area and have a craving for some top-notch pork ribs, don‚Äôt miss out on this place!","One of the hidden gems in Baliüòç first time trying Ajik‚Äôs Iga pork ribs because I watched it on TikTok.
The ribs was nice & fresh, the fried pork belly was perfect!!!
the service was fast, and the price is still reasonable

even though the place is bit far. But it was a humble place.

Overall I will recommend the ribs and will re-visit ü•∞","Hidden gem!! Good taste of pork ribs, 500gr is big enough to filling up your belly, moist and juicy, last but not least good value for money.","Tasty ribs with moderate price, 125k for 500gr, even though it's a little bit sweet for my preference. Jusk ask for sambal matah if you want , its nice.
It will be better if they can speed up the service and add more option for salad/vegetables.","Great ribs, fantastic chicken&corn soup en very friendly service. And for a very reasonable price. You just have to follow the signs along the back road and you will see it after about 200 meters. Well worth the visit."
