They only serve one set menu which consists of fried fish, soup and rice.

Pretty generous portion for the price, but taste-wise it was okay. Fried fish is big but kinda dry when I got mine. Fish soup taste pretty good but nothing extra ordinary.

The place always crowded most of the time, so always prepare to queue. We were waiting for around 30 mins for our group of seven, and expect to sit with other party since the place is not that big.

It's okay for the price or if you're curious what it's all about, but for the queue time I think you can try other places.","You know the shop is good when they’re confident enough to have just 1 menu…
1 set cost 55k includes 1 rice, 1 fried fish, 1 fish head soup.
The fried fish was so fresh and crispy and THICC it felt like eating a steak!
The soup base tasted delicious too!
It’s such a good deal imo !
They have other branches if this one is packed!","Truly an amazing gastronomic experience. As a person who has analysis-paralysis when at a new eatery i appreciated the simplicity of the one-item menu. The selection of beverages is quite wide though, as is their seafood cracker section next to the payment counter. Fish freshness was excellent, the portion sizes were enormous, and everything was flavourful. Everything is a little on the spicy side.

The wait can be quite long though. Getting a table requires being on a walk-in wait list and often involves shared tables. Just look for the uniformed staff yelling out party names to get placed on the list.","Seems to be quite popular among locals and maybe even tourists as there was a bit of a queue when we came. They only have one thing on their menu: a set meal consisting of fried fish, spicy fish head soup, and rice.

The taste was just above average. I don't think it's worth going out of your way for, but if you happen to be in the area and don't really know what to eat, I'd say go for it. It's cheap anyways at only 55k for the set and the portion was quite filling.","Just be patient for the queue, very tasty, one of the best fish soup, you get the experience of tasteful spicy and sour soup.
The fried fish also good with their home made chili."

Very safe and nice walking in the evening and night.
Highly recommended although it is half way around the world.","Hello friends 😁😁😁 I 💕 Sanyr beach..... correct Matahari beach...This is a port nearby, you can sail to Nusa Penida, and Lembongan... as well as Gili..., who needs tickets to these destinations at a discount and transfer from the hotel, write to me in private messages...

I'd suggest you to go through next to Andaz or small street before mercure hotel. Pay the parking service for 2k (the most sucks thing in bali).

There is a beach with playground which is behind of Mercure hotel, it's called Pantai Cemara. It's good for kids.
The beaches are not the place for swim.
Just good place to be in peace for a bit.

It turned out to be a lovely experience. It's located in a very strategic spot, near some -you already knew- food restaurants, mini market, ATM and just a walk away to sanur beach.
Our room is big enough. I requested two double beds and to be merged and they did it. Thank you!
We also loved the pool! We don't get sun heated in the morning and also in the afternoon. The water is warm. Kids loved swimming here.","I had an overall pleasant experience at Prime Plaza Hotel.  The room service was great and the food, especially the salmon medallion, was amazing!  The juices offered at the bar are also great, and perfect since I can't have ice (scared of tap water).

My room was a long walk away from the lobby, which was a tiny trek when tired.  But the benefit was that it was away from the other guests, so I had a quiet stay.  I stayed during Nyepi, which meant I spent the entire duration inside, enjoying the food and pool.

My only complaint was that I felt a bit ill on the morning of my checkout and asked for a late check out at 3pm.  They stated that the charge was 300k for 3 hours.  I asked for it to be complimentary, given the circumstances I was feeling sick and would like to be a guest again.  They denied the request, so I only got about four hours of sleep and felt horrible.  Upon checkout, they did waive the fee for 1 hour (checked out at 1pm), so despite being miserable and on 4 hours of sleep, I did feel a bit better about it.

Overall, had it not been for the greedy late checkout policy, I would have given 5/5, but it really made my day miserable, having left so tired and sleepy.  For the 1 hour waiver, excellent food, and good service, I'd give it a total 3.5/5.

I would stay here again if they had promotional rates, a sale, or maybe changed their checkout policy to be more flexible.  They have an abundance of rooms, so I don't understand why the charge is necessary, given that they're not fully booked out.","Stayed here with my family for 2 nights, because it near mak beng. Overall very good, nice loong pool, delicious breakfast, clean room. Recommended to stay in pool side rooms, so kids can easily access it. The down side was gofood drop point only to security checkpoint, and parking zone near lobby which they said only for hotel pickup car, which obviosly occupied by non hotel cars (military personnel car and arrogant fortuner driver with civil marking but many rotators). If we need to pay to get those parking area just told us so, dont lie. In holiday, we're just same as others, dont give priorities to arrogant stupid people. Thanks","The rooms and hotel itself is lovely, however the pool is filled with kids playing basketball and volleyball 9am-9pm. There is no chance of relaxing or going for a swim which is such a shame. I was also woken up by gardening right outside my door and sweeping the patio at 6:30am. Wouldn’t stay here if your wanting to relax","A Unique hotel because this hotel still has Balinese culture by introduce of the name of the Regency in Bali, many varian of dessert, and i like Klepon Cake because it is out of the original without leaving it characteristic.
The service is good and the staff are very friendly especially Mrs. Made Dendy."

Some of the rooms are undergoing renovation.

Hotel is still in soft opening stage, so some of the facilities, like the gym, not ready yet. Instead of the gym, they have yoga class and shadow boxing class, and bicycles.

The service is excellent. Rooms decor gorgeous. Lobby, walkways, design are top notch.

Stayed 3 nights at Meru, assigned to the third floor. Great view from the third floor.

Breakfast spread - lots of selection.

All in all - excellent experience.","Recently opened new hotel in Sanur area. There are actually two hotels in the same site, the easily-spotted Bali Beach Hotel (which is heavily renovated heritage hotel) and The Meru which is more of the luxurious version.

Keep in mind that these are two separate hotels, but they do share the same lobby and breakfast/dining area, though I'm not sure if they gonna keep the dining area combined once they fully opened.

Yes, they're still in a kind of soft opening stage. I asked the staff and they're scheduled to fully open by September or October if I recall correctly. As of now there's only one building wing that's operational, with another wing still in progress.

Well, even in their pre-grand opening stage, this hotel blew me away. The welcoming corridor makes you feel you're being transitioned from the real world to their own tranquil world, then you're welcomed to their welcome lobby which is very spacious and lovely-designed with elements of wood and carvings.

The architecture in this hotel is just on another level. Yes, there might be bigger, grander hotel, but there's just something in this hotel that just makes it more calming, prettier and tranquil. It's just beautiful. From the corridor, lobby, to the room corridor, the architecture is something else. It feels like you're experiencing art.

The room is also very spacious, comfortable and very well-designed. The touch of wood and warm color really makes a comfortable stay. Oh did I also mention that it was CLEAN?
Again, there might be hotels with bigger room but The Meru's room is just so well-put it just makes me feel right at home.

The staff are also very friendly and helpful. One even went above and beyond in their service. Once I asked for a buggy ride from the drop-off lobby to our room building since it was quite a walk and my wife is pregnant. The staff who drove us (I forgot to ask for his name, but I hope good things come to your way!) not only drive us to the usual drop point. He even drove us to another route which is closer to our room since he noticed my wife was tired. The staff is just on another level.

The Meru also have a direct access to the beach which is a big plus for people that loves to hang out at the beach, though the beach is not private. But this makes a lively beach front with a lot of people passing by running or riding a bicycle along the shoreline to enjoy the beach. Speaking of bicycle, the hotel also offers free bicycle rental for its guests.

The breakfast/dining area is also well-designed, very comfortable with open-air design which makes a great breakfast experience where we can just sit and enjoy the meal overlooking the pool and the beachfront.

Also, this might be a bit nitpicking, but I guess the service at breakfast could be improved a bit. On separate days during breakfast I noticed that while the staff were quick to welcome you to your seat and ask me for my order, it took somewhat quiet a bit of time for me to get my order, if at all. Though I saw that the breakfast staff do get really busy at times and look understaffed so I don't really mind. This is just a small inconvenience, which make it more understandable since they're officially not a fully functioned hotel, but it does takes away the experience of a great breakfast time. Hopefully the service will improve once they fully opened in Q4.

But overall the experience of staying in The Meru is just top-notch. The room, the lobby, the ambience, the architecture, the staff.. they were just magnificent. All of those really makes a really great experience.

The Meru should be on your short-list for your next getaway on the island.","Very majestic feel of the interior. Newly build, food at the restaurant was great esp the indonesian cuisine. Room was nice, clean , complete amenities but some of the bathroom's light was down. New hotel but there's already scratches on the bathroom hardware. Would love to come back again!",Beautifully designed new resort hotel in Bali. The sheer scale of the architecture was very impressive. Service was excellent as well.,"The room is heavenly.

The house itself is beautiful with exquisite carvings.  Lovely garden and pond, too.

(-) The house, furniture and painting collection needs immediate restoration. Perhaps a collaboration of professionals from Indonesia and. Belgium.  I see termites everywhere. The lighting  needs adjustment since it reflects on the glasses that protect the paintings, making it hard to enjoy the paintings. Some windows need to be blocked, the direct sunlight is damaging the paintings.

They recently increased the entry ticket price. Rp.30.000 for Indonesian nationals/adults  and Rp.100.000 for foreigners.","Overall a very nice museum to see some cool paintings from various different mediums, as well as furniture and photographs from the past. There are 2 buildings which house the collection, but it seems that one of them seems to be not finished. A bit more signs to explain the context and the history of the place and better care for the collection should definitely be added for the future. Definitely a nice little detour if you have the time, would take around 15 minutes 👍. Remember to not take any photographs of the collection!","Well worth the stroll up Sanur beach to see this. First a sumptuous example of 1930s Balinese architecture and décor set in peaceful gardens with the sound of the ocean just over the wall; second to see the works of the Belgian artist who settled here, Le Mayeur. Personally I preferred the impressionistic oil paintings of landscapes and harbour scenes to the (numerous) aquarelles and drawings of bare-breasted Balinese women.

Recommend their signature iced coffee drink with an extra shot of espresso, because I like my coffee strong!",Cappuccino better than most of the cappuccino in Germany an nearby Italian one's. Really great

My money gone without knowing what and how..... in the morning. 😑","After booking through Agoda 10days ago, for a couple + baby (including baby cot), we arrived at reception at 6pm, they claimed not working with Agoda anymore… they had a room for us if we wanted but could not help us for the baby (even with a simple mattress). Was right before sun down.. super disappointed about their reaction and surprised about lack of understanding / help.
But “stay in peace” as they kept repeating while mocking us. Pity.","Typical 300k guest house that gets the job done for when your last ferry was cancelled. The place is run by an older couple that is friendly and check in without a reservation is possible.
The facilities are a little old, the location however is perfect and free banana pancake for breakfast.","Great location to restaurants and the fast boat harbour.  Clean spacious room. Friendly helpful staff.
Shower had poor pressure and only cold water.","Value for money. Simple but everything you need is available. For those who plan to go to Nusa Penida; you definitely need a stay near to Sanur Harbour and Agung & Sue is the place to go! By foot it will be around 6-8mins walk. Convenient really, as the ferry to Nusa Penida Harbour departs early in the morning."

Highly recommend it and I will visit again :)","Best steak I had for a very long time. Small but nice selection of red wines at a very reasonable prices. The staff is pretty much perfect and very attentive. The food is not cheap, but you wouldn't expect it to be at premium quality.","One of our ""a must place to go"" when we visit Bali. They serve an Argentinian style steak with a various kind of beef for grilling on the coal. Love their chimichurri sauce, which nicely match with the juicy and tender meat. The staffs were very friendly and attentive. They just moved to this Jalan Hang Tuah Sanur, which we think is more cozy than their previous place, on Jalan Danau Tamblingan.","We ate here multiple times during our stay in Sanur. The hostess, Gek, was the highlight of our visits (right there with the delicious food!) She was very doting on our daughter Isabella. It made our dining experience that much better! Our only regret is that we didn’t get to say goodbye to all the staff before we took off! Will definitely come back here when we visit Bali again someday! If you’re anywhere in the island, I recommend this place highly! The food, the staff, and atmosphere is just top notch. Worth the visit!","The best steakhouse in Sanur, maybe even in all of Indonesia. The chef finished grilling the steak at the table, it was perfectly cooked! The service was also super friendly. It was our last restaurant visit on our Indonesia trip and a perfect ending! Terima Kashi!"

I got 50% discount, and Receptionist upgraded my room because of their fault that they did not let me know. So, yeah, I got a bigger room with less money.

One thing: I live in Bali, only 5km to this resort. So this in only a very short gateway when I have extra leave (only 1 night).

Do not expect you'll get nice buildings and very nice services. This resort is >20 years old. And managed by Indonesia state-owned enterprise. Just keep your expectation low.

The pros for me is that this resort still as big as any other resort out there. And this is beachfront resort! You won't be getting a private beach, but at least not so many people in the resort-owned-beach.

For very short escaping from life routine, this one is very good.","I was stayed for a day. It was a good place actually and it's facing the beach. Unfortunately there was no wifi signal can reach out my room, and some of the footpath are broken so you'll need some effort to carries the big suitcase to the room but fortunately I got a superb breakfast in the next morning","Good value for money. Room was spacious and you get your own villa/bungalow for  36 USD/night, but the room we got needs the shower renovated, looked dirty and old. The resort itself is nice, as it is right by the beach. Service staff are pleasant and helpful, and speak decent English.","This hotel gets one star for good location. The room was not very secure. Big gap under the door with critters coming and going all night. We needed to stuff towels under the door. A/C was blowing warm air and was incredibly loud. When we arrived it was painfully clear that the room had not been cleaned in months. The calendar hasn’t been switched since March (stayed mid May) and there was a note letting guests know in February that they would do fogging on the night of our stay- something that we should’ve been told about in advance (we booked in March)! Dust, cob webs, and at least fifty dead flies in our bathtub. With that said- the bathrooms were from a horror movie. And the room was straight out of the 70’s with nothing having been repaired or replaced since then. Every piece of furniture was damaged and the mattress was very low quality, the two of us sunk into the middle of the bed. The WiFi was as you would expect in this situation and we were hard pressed to find any electric outlet in the room. Do yourself a favor and do not book at this Hotel.",Great location. Resort itself is looking a little tired but room was in good order. Very close to beach restaurants and sanur night market. I think it's a very good choice for The money paid.

For half of this you can have a whole dish of Nari Goreng or Nasi Campar in any local restaurant.
Water 600ml charged 8K when it costs 4K in convenience stores like Indomarket.
Last but not least, charged 10% tax. This is unacceptable, in other local restaurants I wasn’t charged this 10%. I felt ripped off","Lovely place by the beach, great coffee, ocean breeze. Quick service
Definitely recommend when in Sanur","Great service, very good food and drinks! Stable and fast WI-FI, no toilets (available outside; around the corner)

We camped there for 2+ hrs, to wait for our airport transport. Staff was super friendly we could even store our luggage for a while to walk around a bit.

Friendly and helpful staff. Budi and his team are lovely people.","Last minute stay. We arrived by ferry from Nusa Penida, and leaving early the next morning for G-land surf camp. The staff were amazingly helpful. Rooms are clean,  huge,  and cozy.  Beautiful pool and gardens too.  Will definitely book again.","Living in the middle of a tropical garden with sharing pool.
