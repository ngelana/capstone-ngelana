We realized they must get kick backs because the food wasn't what the menu boasted..prices were more than typical prices but honestly it wasn't worth it.

You are paying for the view because the food wasn't worth it. We were quite disappointed.

I took a photo side by side of the appetizer I got. The photo was amazing and I was so excited to try it out...yeah and this is what we got.

The fish was good, but again didn't look anything like the photos. It was maybe 1/3 the side of the photos.

Husband's duck was actually nice and tender, but the veggies he had...not sure what to say, how do veggies go wrong? I dunno...

Definitely won't go back, and service was slow too. Not sure if it was because it's island life but just wasn't all that impressed for what we paid.

Definitely do NOT recommend!",Bebek is a must. Having meals at the hut is very nice but if you can’t sit with ur legs folded for long time then better sit at proper table and chairs. Nice environment for photos too.,"While it may be a venue recommended by the local drivers or you may see a lot of tourists coming in after their tour,  the food and service was great. A good selection of local and authentic Balinese cuisine at reasonable fare. Throughly enjoyed our fried duck, which is what I believe to be Bebek Joni's signature dish. We also order the fried fish, which was really good too.

There is a large outdoor dining hall as well as small huts that oversee the rice field.","The best duck eating experience!
We ordered:
Crispy Duck… it’s really good  marination, and the way they cook it in such a way to achieves another leveling crispiness!
Traditional Smoked  Duck..
The best it is amount the duck dish we try.
For me it’s on the saltiness side, because it just jammed pack with smoked flavour all goodness of marination and also the umami bomb that hit your palate right away.
Grilled duck was great too
Another dish worth to mention is Chicken Satay, the best I’ve tried in such a very long time.","The terrace Garden surrounding makes this place bliss

Breezy airy place. They have individual open air cabins

Being a vegetarian had no issues. Took the local bintang beer and sowm Grub

Teh waitress was really good . Food was tasty. Place is not very expensive

I had the curry rice and the sambal was really really tasty and spice level was top. My friends has the fried rice and fish

Highly recommend this place

Will go back"

I've witnessed how this place grows from a cafe with cozy rice fields as the main attraction, to nearly an eatery place with no views. Simply because the owner decided to block the natural greenery with a stage for live music, which makes it no longer unique.

The service is nice, although they seem to change their crews often. However, all servers back then were more communicative than the current ones.

In terms of food, the quality may not have changed much, but the price has climbed up. This is understandable though. I just think the place is so much trying to follow the trend and dismissing the opportunity to have their signature dishes or setting the unique identity to make themselves as outstanding.

Enough saying. I'm not trying to put anyone down here. You can still enjoy the place with your friends or family. Bon appetit!",Very nice spot for good food. Plenty of options from Indonesian food to pizza pastas. My wife vegetarian so they went above and beyond to cater for her. Gave my 4 year old free ice cream. Nice cocktail as well. Lovely team very friendly.,"Amazing service, the kindest people, probably our favorite spot in Ubud for dinner, live music in the evenings(every day after 7pm) and overall vibe. 10/10 would recommend. And the food is really good too 💯","Definitely one of the coziest cafes in the Ubud area. With rice fields view behind and supported by the main road that is not too crowded. And added live music in the evening.

The parking space for cars and motorcycles are spacious. This place is neat and clean. Food and beverages are many.

Starts with the main dish, snacks, appetizers, coffee, noncoffee, and also beer. The taste is worth trying, the price is affordable.","Ordered mango milk tea which had no milk 😅

Ordered sandwich but they gave burger instead.

Food is ok, bubble tea and hot tea tasted good. Ambiance 10/10"

This place was fantastic. Turning off the road you go past a furniture shop, to the back, then set amongst rice fields is this gem.
The service was kind, welcoming and fast, they really made us welcome. The prices were fantastic and very affordable traditional food, with a broad range of favourites. A large range of seafood all fresh and cooked perfectly.
The toilets were clean and had western options.","Came here with my family, looking for gazebo however the staff said they open only 3 gazebo because of limited staff. After negotiation with the staff she open another gazebo for us. Thank you for the great service!

Really good grilled duck (Bebek Bakar). Moist and well done but not dry.
The ice mocha isn't good though. Guess they don't know how to make it here.
The washroom aren't very clean. Even our public washroom at the villa is much cleaner.
Overall, the price and value of the food was very good. We will be back again. Let's hope they have staff to clean the washroom regularly or post signs for male guests to keep it in the toilet bowl.","We had the grilled shrimp, fish and chicken leg.

Everything was great. Just a suggestion, maybe you can add more fan or something? because it's too hot there, especially when crowded hehe, thanks a lot!",Unbelievable food. Hot pot is spicy but so good. Grilled fish and prawns are unreal.

I stayed for one week and would do it again, if I come to Ubud.
My only remarks are, that there seems to be a missing routine on how frequent towels and bed linen should be changed. Perhaps it should be after 3-4 days and the owners should ask the guests for that. The same is to ask the guest if they want the room to be cleaned. When you as a guests ask for it, then this or anything else is solved without any problem.","This is a very simple and humble place to live in , which costs a much cheaper price. My husband and I stayed here for four days and we really loved staying here since it is very quiet and comfortable. The bed is too big for two people and we had enough space to put our things in the room

Comank and Wayan, the lovely owners, were very accomodating. They toured us around Ubud during our first day. They have a car which we rented on the first day and a motor bike which we used to bring us to other places for the rest of the days. Again, the rent was really cheap!

The guest house is good for those who do not expect a luxurious place to stay in. Expect only the things you really need like a shower room, a cabinet, a bed, an electricfan (it is breezy there at night so dont worry about the heat), and a balcony where you could drink a cup of coffee or a bottle of beer.","Cheap and close to main ubud attractions, hosts was nice and rented a scooter for us, matress was really old and weird shaped, didn't slept comfy, also roosters would sing at 5am every day.
Other than that was nice, clean and the host is helpfull.",Lovely guesthouse. The landlady and his son are very friendly and helpful. They take us by their scooters to Kura bus station.,"This is a nice and cheap place with friendly owners. However, the mattress is also very cheap, it's made of foam and since it's not new anymore, the area where you're supposed to lay is bent in and when you lay down you sink in by 10 centimeters. This made it difficult to sleep and gave me back pain every night even though I'm skinny. Sleep quality is the most important criterion of any room, therefore only 3 stars."

All the high-end restaurants in the ubud center don't even come close to this taste.
If u give this place a chance n order their signature dish, i.e., Paket lalapan A Bakar. You will come again for double serving, which I did. I also requested for fresh chilly so I can bite on it and drink beer while I enjoy the dish. Also, it doesn't cost much. Around 25k/dish.
Give yourself a chance. You will not be disappointed. The number of grabgo guys that come n pick up the food entails its demand. This place is a gem.",Best Ayam Bakar I’ve had in my entire life. Friendly staff too! Never missed to eat it every week.,"a stall where they sell grilled chicken which is quite tasty & delicious

Another delicious accompaniment menu is tempeh and grilled tofu.
This stall also sells several other menus such as fried chicken, fried catfish, honey grilled chicken,

This shop is strategically located on the edge of the Goa Gajah main road,","The food was so tasty and delicious.
However the staff were so noisy. They invitied their friend from outside which is she’s not the staff. They talked so loud. It is really uncomfortable. It created a bad environment.",So nice     good 1 !!!!!!!  ❤️ 💙 💜

We have been living with them for a few months now. The provide nice rooms with private bathroom and private kitchen. The rooms are amazing and one of them just got finished a few days ago. They are well known among my friends in Ubud for their cheap but great motorbike rental.
The garden is a beautiful oasis to relax.","We are really like to live here. We arrived from 2019 november to 2020 februar. The house is super good with AC and WIFI.
