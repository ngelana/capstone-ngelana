Overall, I can recommend this place to chillin' hang out with friends at still affordable price keep improving","The service was excellent.. my coffee was too sweet (for me), better ask separate sugar when ordering. They provided WiFi and told you the password without you ask, such a good service.","Cozy place, great service, good coffee recomendation and affordable price","Comfy, spacious, lovely garden view and soft breeze.

Very large, cosy rooms. The owner is super sweet!
The accommodation is relatively hidden, on Google Maps it is displayed slightly incorrectly. This is a bit annoying, but feel free to contact the owner, he will help you","What a wonderful time we had in Sanur and especially in this guest house. The owner is one of the kindest people I have met. Easy morning we'd get coffee and tea. He helped us get scooters and tickets for a boat. The last morning when some of us weren't feeling that well, he got some guave leaves that can be cooked for tea.

The accommodation is perfect. Clean, spacious, AC, drinking water every day. With a scooter or taxi (ca 1 euro) its max 10 minutes to the beach.

Would recommend to anyone and would definitely go back when visiting Bali.","We had a very enjoyable stay at Loven Sanur Guest House.

The family who run it are very friendly and welcoming.

We rented a scooter which I would recommend. A short ride can get you to all shops, restaurants and the beach.

The room was great.","The first time I had the large downstairs bedroom with 2 beds, it was comfortable apart from the shower towels which are of poor quality (synthetic, it does not absorb water).  It is outside the hustle and bustle of the city.  The second time, I had the second room downstairs, right next to their house, their dog barked a lot during the night, obviously I couldn't sleep well (my neighbor in the next room felt the  same thing) .  In addition the washbasin does not work (not easy to wash your teeth, hands ..).  Then there is a strong bad smell in the bathroom (humidity) which infuses the whole room.  The curtain in the bedroom is not opaque, it lets the light passes.  And then there was no bedside lamp, I asked for one, the owner gave it to me. The bed makes noise.  It's a small house, in terms of privacy, it doesn't feel like a hotel.  (Barely awake, I open my door, 3 seconds later the owner comes to talk to me).  Behind this smiling appearance, I felt the owner's desire for control.  Mastery is not control.  Control is a consequence of fear itself.  Fear is a consequence of ignorance, conversely Love is a consequence of Knowledge.  Of course, Know is not Knowledge, in other words one does not learn to swim in books.  I transmit this observation in order to enlighten my brothers and sisters so that it improves.  Enlightening others is True Love.  Obviously Love is not attachment, attachment is the fear of change.  I wish you a Conscious reception.  As Jesus Christ said: ""The Truth will set you free"".",Great place there is a market nearby and the hostess super nice he brought us coffee every single morning and helped us out with finding the boats to the island. I highly recommend this room. It‚Äôs very big and spacious and there‚Äôs a good air-conditioning
