The people are so kind, the food is fantastic (couldn’t find anything to match it in all Lovina), thé spa was reasonable and beyond what I expected and the rooms are well equipped and extremely comfortable and well decorated. The staff were helpful with everything we needed. We will be returning!  Thank you so much everyone for your kindness and hospitality xx","We stayed for 6 nights in a private pool villa and had dinner at The Damai on three nights. This is a small luxurious boutique resort and we cannot fault it. The atmosphere is enchanting, the pool villa offers absolute privacy and the service is second-to-none.  A perfect place to relax and to recharge your batteries.  It escapes us how this place is listed as only 4 stars on Google maps.  Having travelled extensively for business for many years, I have seen many 5 star-rated hotels that don't come close to The Damai.

Highly recommended!","Beautiful hotel (exceeded my expectations). Perfect for a honeymoon or intimate holiday. Service was very good, with a lot of attention to detail. Restaurant also offered delicious breakfast and food!","I never write reviews however have been traveling the world for work and pleasure the past 16 years and was pleasantly surprised.
It was a last minute booking so no prior research was done.
The drive was somewhat remote from a general store so I was a tad concerned. After arriving I quickly realized that I was in good hands. The staff is attentive, patient and friendly.
I was the only American during my stay as most were European and 30% with young kids. Normally I shy away from family friendly b/c I like pure solitude. Since there are a number of private suites with pools there is little to no issue with noise from children. Very peaceful and quiet.
The bartender is a true local mixologist and takes a great deal of pride in his craft, every ingredient is fresh and the recipe well thought out.
The food… exceptional, truly! They offer local dishes as well as fusion. Extremely well balanced flavors, fresh ingredients and unique recipes. I was completely surprised and ate more than usual.
Now to the spa. WOW! I stayed 2 days longer just to receive the treatments. Absolutely amazing and therapeutic.
The rooms are spacious, clean and Bali modern. The bed was comfy and the sounds of nature are relaxing.
Free yoga class in the morning and a nice sunset view.
If looking for a triplet remote yet relaxing experience this is a gem.
I selfishly did not want to share this review to avoid having to book far in advance as the secret of this place gets out.","The pool villas are good and warrant a four star  the location is peacfull and ""out of the way, food was ok but not enough choice and expensive for that offered, I have my doubts that the food was fresh and not frozen as many of the dishes are  repeated every few days however, I can not be sure, overall (appart from the pool villas) the hotel needs a lot of work to be justified a claimed 4 star rating, one the the biggest problems is no phones in the rooms and you are forced to use WhatsApp if
you like it or not on this alone I would not return. Overall a lot of work needed to lift this hotel to the claimed 4 star rating as at the moment it in my opinion doesn't meet this and could with a lot of work be a 5 star hotel."

Looking out onto lush jungle you really feel you are in touch with nature. The grounds of Alamanda are lush and peaceful with multiple pools to relax in you will get a true feeling of North Bali life. Whether you wish to relax and unwind or explore all that North Bali has to offer Alamanda provides a great base with excellent services and amenities.,"I stayed at Alamanda in February 2024, and had a very pleasant stay. The place is very peaceful. It is very convenient to have a bar and restaurant at the hotel but if you want to go downtown, the hotel has a shuttle.
I joined the yoga class everyday, one of the most beautiful place I practiced yoga ever.","We had a girls trip up here and loved every minute. The place is so gorgeous, a credit to the owners. A lovely yoga space with a private morning Pilates class upon request, beautiful space for massage and two private pools. All of this is surrounded by stunning gardens that really are incredible to explore. Lovely views from every angle. We also enjoyed the dolphin swimming, organised by the resort. Was a great trip and will come back with more friends/family.","Wow, a really nice resort. Beautiful gardens. I really enjoyed the peace and quiet of being up the hill from Lovina but being able to go in via the shuttle. Very cool shala and on-site instructor for your yoga needs (incidentally a nice way of meeting some local folk, ex-pat and Balinese, I found). Staff were great: nothing is too hard; Mini and Kadek Aryx = worth their weight in gold ...","Beautiful experience we had at Villa Alamanda. The view from our room was incredible, perfect for private quiet experience. we did Yoga in the morning and it was the best way to wake up before seeing the dolphins. Had great souvlaki. My best stay in Singaraja so far"

Fresh catch of the day was beautiful. Not cheap but worth the money. Mostly organic, some grown in their own garden","We didn't stay in the hotel but we wanted a very good restaurant.
Actually it was not good, it was amazing! The food was incredible, the service was just perfect. We had a romantic table just very close to the Swimming Pool, very nice view...

Of course it's quite expensive for Bali but if you want to have a good experience you should totally go there! :)","Returning to Lovina Beach, after three years, just to visit The Damai Restaurant, is a decision we haven’t regret. We have been eating here for five evenings straight and the kitchen just continues to amaze us with one delicious dish after another.

Our personal favourites are the seafood and desserts which are “out of this world”. If you are not into seafood, we are quite confident that you can still find just what you like from the diverse menu - and if not, the staff will not hesitate to prepare something just for you.

Besides the food you are most certain to feel at home; the entire staff are all kind and they make you feel welcome in a way that is hard to describe. Just go, you will not regret visiting this place!",Such a beautiful location. A lot more pricey than normal Bali restaurants but amazing.,"We stayed at the Lovina Beach Resort and for my birthday we choose The Damai on recommandation  published by Insightguides. In one word:
FABULOUS"
