Restaurant have plenty of sitting and knowledgeable staff. Taste good also.,"Cosy restaurant, friendly staff, and tasty food. The gurame fish cooked in a gravy that was different from other restaurants. The satay prawn also was marinated well. The first time we tried plecing kangkung n fell in love with itüòç","We ordered 'paket Megibung' with the price of Rp200.000,00 for 4 persons. It consists of fried fish, pepes (steamed fish), rice, plecing kangkung, and 4 pieces of grilled prawns. All fish is Gurame. If you like the taste of aromatic ginger, then you might like the pepes ikan. The only ""irritating problem"" is they only provide a little sambal (chilli paste) in a little saucer for 4 persons. So, we had to order two more sambal served in a little saucer. One additional sambal costs Rp5.000,00. I also ordered one bowl of 'crab & asparagus soup'. It's a bit too thick for me. But overall the place was okay.",The taste is good. They have a package for 4 people and the price is not really expensive. The food taste is so local but it‚Äôs delicious. I came here on the late lunch time but the restaurant still full but they still served us so quick. If you like seafood with local taste then you have to come here.,"Really good Indonesian food. They specialise in sea food, so if you enjoy that then I recommend getting that. I myself had some fried prawns and chicken, the flavours were really good, sauce was tasty and spicy.

Really happy with place and I would eat here again."
