They have a very very very cute decoration for the working space. Indoor and outdoor areas and both are very cozy and beautiful. They provide many plugs and make it perfect as the co working space.

About food, they have various menus for food and beverages, and have non dairy option too. The price is fine, with the good coffe quality. The food is just ok.

Little suggestions: they can add the power of the AC in the main room. In afternoon the room feels hot. Also sometimes the wifi is soo slow. They have many customers, so better they also add the internet speed.

Overall, is it recommended? Yes, if you are looking for a place to hang out and I suggest come at evening, its a very nice place to chilling with friends. If you are planning to work here, I suggesg come at morning or afternoon.","Good food and coffee. Great place to work. Friendly staff. They need to have parking guy,because when the cafe get crowded people just park anywhere they like. All the best for SAI!","A very cozy place to work remotely or to simply hang out alone/with your loved ones in Denpasar. It felt like I was traveled back in early 2000s when I went here.

They have plenty of space both indoor and outdoor, but I especially love the backyard outdoor space. I went here during the day when it was blazing hot, but I did not shed a single sweat here. Tons of books available, as well as good wifi (it was kind of crowded but the connection was really stable for working). Clean toilet, friendly staffs, and decent working space.

I ordered french fries, iced matcha latte, and strawberry yakult milk. The french fries is just okay - no special seasonings, decent portioning. I wouldn't recommend the matcha latte if you're a matcha enthusiast, not the worst matcha latte i ever had, but not the best either. It tastes a bit too milky, can't really taste the matcha at all. However, I recommend the strawberry yakult milk instead. it's sweet and sour and very fresh which was perfect for the sunny weather.","The location is very strategic. The first time I was there was last year, and at that time I thought that the options in the menu was too limited. Today I went here again, and I notice that they have more variety in their menu. I order hot lemon tea which taste so good, and vietnamese spring rolls. The spring rolls is surprisingly delicious. The vegetables are so fresh and there's some shrimps inside too. The sauce also taste great which becomes a very good complement to the veggies. The ambience is nice and calm. There are two areas, indoor and outdoor. I'd definitely come back.","first visit, all menu with rice wasn't available
just order manual brew coffee. it's okay but there are other recommended places for manual brew brew. Attractive decoration"

Almost two years back the niece of the indo-chinese management took over the daily business. Since then all things turned into a negative way.

Because of rain I was forced to change the room because the ceiling was leaking!

The fact that the cleaning is every 2 days was new for me too. When I asked for a second towel - as I always got before - I was told that as a long term guest (2 weeks) I have no claim to get another towel. The one which I‚Äôve got has never been changed within the 2-week-period.

The Vinhill is not anymore the same as it was few years back and that's a shame. I never felt welcome. The management does not know how to treat regular guests.

Overall, I definitely cannot recommend this accommodation anymore, because the management is increasing the prices but  constantly dramatically decreasing the service!","Clean, well maintained and cozy serviced studio apartments.
