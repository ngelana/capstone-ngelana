The staff was helpful and contacted the intermediary, who apologized for the inconvenience and assured me that the amount would be refunded within 30 business days. Unfortunately, I had to make another payment for the hotel ü•≤.

The employees were very helpful and excellent. The place, in general, was comfortable, peaceful, and beautiful.

However, the room was not clean to the desired standard. The room had to be changed twice because the bed sheets were not clean.

Thank you for all staff ü§çü§ç","Visited Glamping Triyana Resort in Carangsari (I just know that Carangsari is on another side of the Ayung river with Ubud), this Glamping offering beautiful lush greenery to their visitors. They offer the glamping (glamorous camping) tent with private pool and the one without, and in this visit, I try the one without the pool. Their glamping tent equipped with air conditioner, tv with Netflix, refrigerator and bathtub. But since they're located in the greenery, there're many insects like ants, flying termites and even lizards, so beware to not hurt them. Still it's definitely one of the best resort for glamping in Bali.","A must place in Bali for staycation. Everything is perfect including the service and food. They offer floating breakfast as well. Very big place which is great for team, couples and family. Amenities are exceptional. Very great interior. I will surely come back. üíñ","The room was great, but the services are different. I stayed for 2 nights. The first time, they didn't refill hand soap, there was a cockroach carcass in front of the door of bathroom's door. Secondly, body soap has ended and they didn't refill it too. I was asking to change the linen but they didn't.
Location is simple and I don't think they didn't ready to open because there are maintanences of facilities around there.
The goods are great, especially the yellow rice with other things on breakfast.","We had a 2 night stay in this cute cottage. My husband and I had taken the small cottage, as we had planned to travel throughout the day. The staff really needs to focus on the upkeep and maintenance of these cottages, there was a lot of mouldy odour in the room with a lot of mould stains on the canvas of the cottage. The cupboard drawers were not clean as well. The shower cubicle could have been cleaner in terms of stains too. Other than these, the staff was very polite and helpful. The food was great!"

Yan. Tour guide five star
Recommended 100%","The walk around the village was exceptional, a thoroughly authentic view of Balinese life.  The POD chocolate experience was the complete opposite. We paid for lunch but this never turned up, in fact our booking was questioned from the start. After 3 idle hours, enough was enough and we left.",The nature and the rafting trip was wonderful. But the experience is spoiled by annoying and tempramental guide.,"Bad bad idea to ride elephant! Please choose a better activity! Watching ricefield, trek in the waterfalls. Message me if you need ideas I will give you plenty.  BUt riding, even just going there is bad. Elephant should be wild in the nature. Not attached to a rope.","Well cared for elephants. Would have been 5 stars but it is on the pricy side for families. Well worth the money if you can afford it though. We splurged and happy we did.

Visit the chocolate factory while you wait (free samples). Elephants are rotated so they get a rest between rides. Three month old elephant calf and the sunbear were unexpected bonuses. Three more pregnant so they were not being ridden but with the calf.

Lunch was nice too. Driver was very funny and knowledgable. Very good English. Took us on different routes so we saw more of Bali and the journey was part of the experience."

We came at Carangsari for few days, very easy to find but far from the crowd, we discovered the natural beauty of BALI‚Äôs country side, the jungle mixed with wonderful rice fields all around the beautiful Villa üåæ‚ú®

Close from UBUD (30 minutes ride by car or scooter, we had scooters) CARANGSARI Villa is an authentic place and allows you to experience the local life of the villages around üõµüè°

In the area of the Villa you‚Äôll find easily small restaurants with local and world cuisine, SPA, a monkey jungle way less crowded than the Ubud one, Balinese traditional dances, and incredible temples (Beji Samuan) where you will heal and purify yourself üôèüí¶

It has also been a sportive experience with  ‚ÄúAlam Tirta‚Äù and ‚ÄúBali ATV Ride‚Äù places :
* Quad
* Rafting
* Paintball
* Cycling
* Trekking
* Flying box

After a good day of road trip, sports and sightseeing you will get back to paradise and enjoy the calm of the Villa with the swimming pool and shady places to rest, read or meditate üìø

The Rooms are soooo bright and clean, the beds comfortable and all the needed furniture are there, you can also use the kitchen wich is well equipped ü™Ω

Well ! This place must obviously be seen and experienced, moreover to avoid the activity of UBUD area wich can be crazy sometimes, even if UBUD it‚Äôs still a unique and historic city üáÆüá©

Go to Carangsari Villa you will feel like privileged local guests, but shhhhh  don‚Äôt tell everyone, it‚Äôs a secret ü§´ ‚ú®
