The service is great, attentive, polite, professional and generally good people.  The food is good but not great. The burger was tasty but the nun just fell apart in your hands.  The fried were OK.  The pancakes were amazingly topped with fruit, syrup, coconut flakes, popcorn, peanut butter and a whole set of things that made it look it would come from a gourmet restaurant.  However once you took a bite, the pancake itself was a bit thick and chewy spoiled the gourmet toppings.  Minus a few problems with the food, this place would deserve 6 stars.  I'll give it a try again to see if things improve","I love visiting this relaxing restaurant for a late lunch. I enjoyed the ambiance, and the non-smoking area is nice for a non-smoker like me.

On a heavy day this place is unable to mange the customers. A bit understaffed. But once ordered the food came quickly.
Taste was good. We tried the Mahi Mahi sandwich and spring rolls.
It‚Äôs mostly open but there is not enough ventilation on a hot day. Only ceiling fans which aren‚Äôt that useful. Not a place to be on a hot sunny day."

Not as busy as now. They have a menu for breakfast also. So u can enjoy ur meals here since morning. U can also work here. I like their Caesar salad but not the watermelon fresh juice.

First time here and the food and drinks were amazing ü§©

We ordered a few things:
1. The Baker's Scrambled eggs croissant (5/5) The croissant was amazing and the bacon was delicious!ü§§ MUST TRY
2. The Baker's Benedict (4/5) Runny egg was the best part of the meal.
3. Brioche French toast (3/5) a little too sweet because of the nutella inside, the french toast was lacking eggs
4. The Baker's Big Breakfast (5/5)Great breakfast/brunch meal!

Drinks:
1. Juice Anti Oxidant (4/5) abit too sweet (caution it's quite filling)
2. Manual brew coffee (5/5) great single origin
3. Cappuccino (4/5) smooth and nice
4. Hawaiian Mojito (3/5) just normal/ordinary, nothing special

Overall, the food portion was good and the price was reasonable. A nice place to relax and chill with friends.

Other than that, I would recommend giving this place a go üòÅ","Love this place..from french pastries and desserts to Balinese specialties, there‚Äôs just so many to choose from! Check out their menu and if you love food like we do, you will understand. The only missing in their menu is alcohol- which is not a bad thing. Grab a refreshing freshly squeezed juice or iced coffee, go out in their newly renovated veranda and enjoy the breathtaking views. Love it. My kind of place. I will definitely come back again and again.","Our first breakfast in Bali was fantastic. The restaurant is very instagrammable, with its bright decor, wonderful outside seating area with great views of the rice paddies. The pastries and tarts were all beautiful and decadent. The breakfast items were also well prepared and delicious. A little more care could have been taken on the presentation of the burgers and sandwiches. But overall a fantastic experience.","Monsieur Spoon Restaurant is a delightful gem in the heart of the city. From the moment you step in, you are greeted with the aroma of freshly baked pastries that are simply divine. The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive, making sure your dining experience is nothing short of perfect.

The interior is beautifully designed, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. And if you prefer to enjoy your meal outdoors, the outdoor seating area offers a picturesque view of the paddy fields, adding an extra touch of tranquility to your dining experience.

Overall, Monseur Spoon Restaurant is a must-visit for anyone looking for delicious pastries, friendly service, and a charming ambiance. I highly recommend stopping by for a delightful meal that will surely leave you craving for more!","Lovely venue, exceptional service.  The food was a little hit and miss.  The Wagya Croissant was packed with caramelized onions, and it was the only thing that I could taste.  The salmon benedict was lovely. Sourdough was weak.  Cappuccino was strong and bitter, which is perfect for me.  They have a selection of hot / ice chocolates which was a beautiful surprise, I had a mint chocolate and it was exceptional.

It has a mini mart nearby with some nice coffee shops as well. The AC works very well. They provide slippers which i liked.

The breakfast options is pretty limited which meant I ended up not eating breakfast here. Despite the bed being comfy, I think they need to invest into new sheets as the bedsheets were dirty & stained. I ended up staying in 2 different rooms - ones of the rooms had a shower which was good, but the other room had a dribble of water. The corridors in the hotel need a lick of paint and a fix up, it seemed a bit eery when walking to the room.","Staying overnight has been delightful, and I find myself wishing for an extended stay. The room‚Äôs allure is undeniable, boasting pool access and the most heavenly bed and pillows. Convenience characterizes the location, and the hotel‚Äôs excellence is further elevated by its exceptional staff. The staff definitely make the experience a 10/10. A special mention goes to Novia at the Front Desk, whose assistance in booking and ensuring a seamless arrival was truly remarkable. She embodies excellence.","Had to give 2 stars because the room was old, the sheets were dirty and we both got bitten by bed bugs. There was beeping sound that could be heard from inside the room all day & night. Had to wear headphones to sleep because it‚Äôs constant beeping, the staff said it was the pool sensor so it cannot be turned off. It keeps me up all night, thank God we only stay for one night.
The service was standard but the receptionist asked me to pay for the room while checking in which I had paid in advance, after another check then confirmed that I was already paid via transfer.
The plus point of this hotel: the provide breakfast and the location was right in Seminyak, and close to Canggu also. There are lots of convenience stores and restaurants nearby but it quite hard to order online cars because of the high traffic.","I stayed from January 12-14, 2024, in 622, in my opinion the atmosphere is very calm, my room is cleaned every day and always changed towels. the security officers are very friendly to every guest and help smooth the car parking area. I had ordered food using online services and I asked to be given to the hotel lobby officer, it turned out that the officers from the hotel were very good, they helped deliver my food to the front door of the room without me asking for help from them. honestly it really helped me. next time I will definitely stay here again.","I often (3-4 times) stay here. Always had bad experiences. AC was leaking, there was no iron to borrow, the hairdryer was broken, and sometimes we got a refrigerator and sometimes we were not. There was no telephone in the room, so if you needed help, you had to ask through WhatsApp and get it from the receptionist directly yourself (they were always that they hadn't staff enough to serve).

The most ridiculous is the security was bad, unfriendly, and not ready if I came by car and didn't have space to park, I had to park next to the building (which is closed by chain).

The good things about this hotel were the price and the location was good. Close to the beach and some cafes."

The restaurant is very nice and comfy and the staff are great! We totally recommend!,"It looks like a fine dining place so we were not sure to go inside as we didn't wear something fancy. The interior is quite unique with water fountain and real plants. But it feels a bit too dark for me. The food is nice. All the pizzas and pasta and pork belly that we ordered are good, though the price is on the higher side.
Unlike other Italian resto, they didn't give us antipasti bread as we wait for our food, which with that price point, it's a bit uncommon. Also we have problem with payment, since they said they didnt get the transfer from qris and asking us to pay twice. If you know the wifi is bad and always created issues with payment, you should not  use qris for it!
Due to the service and issue, our experience was unpleasant.","This restaurant is a MUST visit if you‚Äôre staying in Seminyak.

I highly recommend this restaurant if you come to Seminyak in Bali.","Sardines offers amazing cuisine that perfectly complements my palate, especially as a lover of sardines and tuna. I enjoyed the delightful smoked Negroni during my visit. The service was attentive and friendly, and I really like the cozy ambiance with its traditional hut-like decor. It‚Äôs an experience not to ne missed","Lovely service from the team, so friendly and helpful. Food was also great, I had the sardines, and from the grill prawns and octopus. Octopus was very tender, lovely, could have been a bit hotter and cooked a little more, still nice. Told the staff and they immediately rectified so all great on that front.Ambience with dark lighting, DJ and rice fields with laser lights gave a lovely vibe. The local team really were super lovely and attentive, only slight disappointment was a slightly loud overbearing American hostess who was a bit patronising to the local team, heard her criticizing them to other guests which is just a bit distasteful and uncalled for.

The food was great, especially the pasta and ribs. The wait staff also brought out a dessert and sang Happy Birthday which was a beautiful surprise.
My only note would be that the large outdoor area with fairy lights that you see beautiful photos of, is the ‚Äòsmoking area‚Äô and the ‚Äònon smoking area‚Äô is closer to the kitchen, so keep in mind when booking your table. Would recommend to all my friends and family!","Had the most amazing meal in Bali here! We ordered prawns (which were amazingly plump and tasty), pork belly (which had the most delicious sauce. It was so good we had to order a 2nd serving), steak (cooked to perfection). The staff were super friendly and the atmosphere is really nice too. Would highly highly recommend people to come to Uma Garden to give it a try!","Wonderful experience.
Excellent service and amazing atmosphere. The jazz music added the extra romance in the atmosphere.

We had 5 dishes amongst the 2 of us which added to about $100SGD, which is very affordable.

The beef tartare was amazing and the roasted pork belly was definitely a hit.

Unfortunately my ravioli was alittle under seasoned.

Definitely will come back to try."

We stayed a few days in the Royal Villa, we enjoyed the floating breakfast with unmatched service by the hotel staff. They are always professional, respectful and kind. Would highly recommend.","My partner and I stayed at Monolocale in one of the private pool villas for 9 nights for my birthday and had the absolute best holiday. From the moment we arrived, all the staff were so welcoming and accommodating going above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable. They made the effort to remember our names and greeted us each day which made us feel very welcomed. On the day of my birthday (we didn‚Äôt tell them it was my birthday also) they surprised me at breakfast with pancakes and a candle and sung happy birthday to me and also left a slice of cake in the room fridge for me. Our stay also included 1x floating breakfast, 1x afternoon tea and 1x lunch each which was a really nice addition throughout our stay. The included breakfast options were also very tasty with big servings with fresh bread + fruit.

The location is fantastic, close enough to Seminyak with all the popular foodie restaurants but also tucked away enough to not hear the hustle and bustle of the streets which makes the relaxing at the resort a breeze. The rooms are very beautifully designed and the bed/pillows provided are very comfy. My partner and I spent a lot of time relaxing in the pool which I would say was a highlight of our trip.

We both have stayed in many different accommodations across Bali over the years but Monolocale is the only place my partner and I have both agreed we would come back to purely from such a great experience we have had. We can not recommend this place enough, you will not regret it!"

I really enjoyed the whole experience.","I recently had the pleasure of dining at The Grumpy Butcher, and let me tell you, it was an unforgettable culinary experience! From the moment you walk in, you're greeted by a sleek and modern atmosphere with panoramic windows that offer stunning views of the surrounding nature.

Despite its name, The Grumpy Butcher is anything but grumpy when it comes to serving up delicious BBQ dishes. The menu boasts a variety of mouthwatering options, all cooked and smoked over coffee wood. The brisket, pork ribs, porterhouse steak, and striploin steak were all bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. I couldn't get enough of the smoky depth in every bite!

Not only does The Grumpy Butcher excel in grilled meats, but they also offer a selection of seafood options like salmon, octopus, and king prawns, all expertly grilled to perfection. And let's not forget about their handmade sausages, skewered chicken and beef, and a variety of delicious sides like macaroni cheese and steak chips.

Overall, my experience at The Grumpy Butcher was top-notch. The food was exceptional, the atmosphere was inviting, and the service was impeccable. If you're a fan of BBQ and grilled meats, this place is a must-visit. I'll definitely be returning to satisfy my cravings for their delectable dishes!

We ordered the Burrata, Grain-fed tenderloin, grilled prawns, as well as 4 starters (Mac and cheese - we recommend this, coleslaw, fries and mashed potato). The burrata was so creamy and was an amazing appetizer. The beef and prawns were so well grilled!

We were served by Maria, along with some other service staff who were more than willing to assist. Appreciate the attentiveness to things like getting me a chair for my bag!

Highly recommend this place for a satisfying and chill dinner, I will be back!","One of the best meals we have ever had, the staff were so attentive and the steaks and sides were outstanding, for what you get the price is exceptional. We will be making another visit before we leave! Recommend the rump wagu, cooked to perfection.

From the moment we arrived in the taxi, the staff opened the doors and bought us inside, the best customer service!

But if you‚Äôre a steak lover and a foodie definitely come!","Had a dinner date here after reading the reviews and it was incredible! Exceptional customer services. Kudos to all the staff.

The only downsides are the uncomfortable toilet and the overall atmosphere.","I ordered a 50k menu, but it was out of stock, so I changed the menu, but after 2 hours they forgot. Eventually, the changed menu was out of stock and was replaced with a 25k menu. All I got was a little squid and potatoes. I couldn't believe it. I can't believe my fried squid has been replaced by some squid and fries!

My son had the sausage pasta, the sausage was just OK but not very flavorful.  I had the seafood pasta and it was good but not great.  It came with half a crab which I thought would be good but the crab was pretty small so not shell than meat and some parts of the shell had broken off so it was not easy to eat the pasta without having to be careful.

The menu is quite large with plenty of entrees , western and italian mains along with a large range of pizzas.
My wife tried the chicken schnitzel and I went for the meat lovers pizza.
My wife enjoyed her schnitzel very much as it was accompanied with veges and mashed potato.
My pizza was well cooked just how I like it but it lacked spices as I could only identify ham and flat bacon .
I found at times it was hard to get the staffs attention and had to go to the counter to pay my bill .

I got a family pizza and it was excellent price vs quality vs quantity. Did I say it was really big.

Food was great, bad waitress service and attitude (except the manager which recommends us the food)

The lady manager(?) recommend us their most recommended pizza (forgot the name, but there‚Äôs a photo).

Welcome bread was great, soft bread with acidic olive oil and some round bread with tomato sauce and cheese(?). Then come the pizza which is tasty, tuna tartare taste good as well. Overall nice food.

The negatives:
- after we finished our food, waitress rapidly took our plates, and unnecessarily trying to clean our tables while we‚Äôre still sitting there. A bit of a clean up is okay but she‚Äôs trying to clean everything in front of us while me and my wife were still talking. Pretty sure this is a restaurant with a candles, not a petrol station.
- some water splashing from above, probably water leakage from the ceiling which is normal, but when I report it to head waiter while I‚Äôm paying, he ignores me and rushes back, even though there‚Äôs only 1 other table besides us.
- some ‚Äúhygiene‚Äù issue needs to be addressed as well. A huge roach appeared from the wall beside where my wife were sitting.","Amazing super authentic Italian food. Perfect Al dente pasta.

Cannot fault the quality of the food, notably catering for dietary needs (gluten free and vegan in particular). The waiters/waitresses were incredibly attentive, accomodating and kind throughout the dinner service. We were offered bread to start and also a complimentary shot of limoncello. The vegan ravioli was one of the best I have had.

However, my experience was somewhat marred by witnessing the manager speak harshly to a staff member who accidentally dropped a fork followed by clicking of fingers to get a staff members attention . Mistakes happen - in the scheme of things going on in the world right now, this response just wasn‚Äôt needed. My heart just sunk for the poor girl.

Showing kindness to staff members would greatly enhance the overall dining experience for this brilliant restaurant. Would happily dine again and would highly recommend this spot for a cosy, hearty dinner."
