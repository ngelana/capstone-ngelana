Karangasem, Kabupaten Karangasem, Bali 80811, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=16847683644429532112,CLOSED_TEMPORARILY,+62 812-4674-7157,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.4,614,,"Our family really enjoyed this place. For my daughter it was the highlight of the day. And even for me it was super fun.

I thought this is a small place but they have so many three houses and a lot higher than you can imagine. We didn't dare go to the highest one since we were too scared of the height. The rope bridges were also super exciting to cross. The longest one we didn't try because my daughter who is 8yrs thought its too scary for her.

Really liked the nature aspect and the views also

Only minus I would say is that they don't have a proper western style seated clean toilet.","We thought this was just a tourist trap with a few stairs and chairs, but we were wrong. This place is amazing! So much to explore and do. Be sure to go to the highest point of the structure since the view is breathtaking. The bridges sometimes creek due to the bamboo constructions, but it is very safe. Most importantly, take the long bridge to the other side of the pond to relax in the hammocks and chill at a height of 20m!",Nice place to relax and enjoy fresh air. Be reminded to use comfortable shoes. There are some dogs but don't worry because they are very cute and tame. There is a small food stall there where you can buy simple food.,"There's so many photo spot for the tourist. And many deck & bridge on every different height that you can climb. But for me it a little bit scary, because less safety tool and I think they're not maintain the place regularly. I saw some parts were a little black and I'm so afraid of rotting","Very rustic, but safe and lots of fun, adventurous and relaxing while enjoying the view.  For some even a bit scary and challenging!  I would recommend it for a fun 1-2 hours!"
