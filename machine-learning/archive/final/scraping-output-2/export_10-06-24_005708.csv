Beautiful view with great food. The vegan options are very much appreciated. Additionally, the staff are wonderful. Super friendly and helpful. Went there this morning and going back for dinner.
Update: we went back for dinner and it was delicious. Thoughtfully created and presented.","Last week i went to Cliffhanger twice a week for breakfast, i just realized my first visit there was 3 months ago. Good quality food & peaceful beachfront view, what else could i want more? Love the King & Queen breakfast package as you see in the photos. The other 2 are avocado buritos & avocado salmon. I'll keep coming back for sure! üòÅ","Adorable casual vibe however the quality of the food is wow. One of my favorite restaurants in the area. Great view of the sunset. Funny enough they make an incredible schnitzel, I believe the cook might be German. Also the special they had for prawns and salmons was creatively places with spaghetti with bits of zucchini. I loved the calamari. Staff were friendly and helpful.","The schnitzel never disappoints. Good quality stuff. Staff service is awesome. Pet friendly. Right facing the ocean and great sunset. Highly recommended.
Prices match the portion.","A Delightful Experience at Cliff-Hanger
I absolutely love Cliff-Hanger in Tabanan! The breathtaking beach view adds magic to the dining experience, making it one of my favorite spots. The food is not just excellent; it's outstanding with generous portions that truly satisfy. The prices are entirely worth it for the quality and quantity you get. The staff are incredibly friendly, enhancing the overall warmth of the place. If you're seeking a fantastic dining experience with a view, delicious food, and friendly service, Cliff-Hanger is a must-visit!"

So relaxing and not many people here during the day - basically had the place to ourselves.",A trendy restaurant/cafe/pool bar offering live music and a mix of western and Indonesian food. There was live music the evening I was there. I liked the atmosphere and the drinks but I didn't care so much for the food. The views of the surrounding area are great.

In the evening, they have live music. Not sure everyday or only on the weekend.",Open beachfront great grilled fish and shellfish.  Very reasonably priced! Have singer guitarist with good voice.,Good view. Wide vehicle parking if it's not the season for religious ceremonies. The beach is black sand. The road to this place is paved  and it's charged IDR 5.000 for admission. The days of the foot here average spicy and slightly salty especially for grilled fish. But I like it. Don't forget to order lobster here because the special of the space is lobster. This place is suitable for dating especially for the local.
