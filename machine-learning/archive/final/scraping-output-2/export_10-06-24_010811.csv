Best hotel breakfast ever, enormous choice, good coffee.
Restaurants good, but could do with a rotating daily special, if you are staying for a week like we did a bit of extra variety would not go amiss.
Pools are great, especially the private pool if you want a quieter time.
Room cleaning and servicing really good.
All round great atmosphere and service.  Would definitely come back when the opportunity arises.
Thanks for a great time.","Stayed at Indigo Hotel for a week, check in to check out, the experience was great. The staff at breakfast dining area was par excellence very friendly & professional, taking good care of all guests. Loved the range of fruits and variety, however some of special order has scope for improvement, though nothing major issues. House keeping deserves an acknowledgment, they were great keeping room clean, a little attention to plumbing, fixtures and probably towels ready for the change will further add value. Last, we had dinner at hotel restaurant, and it was great, would recommend.
I would like to acknowledge Ms Ayu (apologies for not getting last name). She was very helpful learning how to move around the area etc and where could we travel.
Thanks again team Indigo.","We have just spent 10 days here and the experience from beginning to end has been amazing, the staff ALL of them from , reception, bar, restaurant, pool, housekeeping and gardeners make this an awesome resort with their smiles and greetings.Had the most comfortable bed ever, great shower, spotless clean room, every couple of days we got a little food surprise in our room. The food is amazing, we are vegan and vegetarian and the chefs were so accommodating. The buffet breakfast is THE BEST they have sooo many choices at different stations for every taste and nationality.","Stayed here for 5 days. From the time I arrived at 1:30am to check-in, it was a great experience all the way through. The staff is attentive and very kind, always happy to help. The hotel is an amazing oasis of tranquility that makes relaxing so easy and welcomed! There is so much to do in the area and the breakfast at the hotel is top notch. The rooms are comfortable and spacious. I have no complaints. I plan to be back with my family in the future.","This is a wonderful location in Bali, and an excellent hotel! Easy access to the beach, and a nice hideaway... also nearby great food and bars. I want to thank the wonderful staff in the Coffee Shop and at the Tree Bar/Restaurant. The nicest, most welcoming people, and I can't thank them enough for their amazing service and kindness."

Everything is just perfect for a beach holiday, it's about 5 min walk to the Seminyak beach but the hotel offers buggy service to the beach as well as Seminyak square area.

The pool and deck area is big enough with many pool chairs.

The breakfast was excellent offering many options as I was on vegetarian in my last day, I had no problem to keep stomach happy from the variety of dishes.

I will definitely come back to this hotel in my next visit, it made things easier and stress-free.","The room with access to the pool is spacious.  Cleaning is good.  Due to the constant humming from the generator, it is impossible to sleep at night, and during the day there are constant screams of children ignoring the kids club area.
The hotel is for families or for large noisy groups, if you want to relax as a couple or alone - I do not recommend it.  Take earplugs with you.

During check-in, they did not explain anything about where the restaurant is, breakfast, or what services are available.  I had to wander around the area and look for everything myself.

Breakfast is chaotic, road noise and a complete lack of service.  I had to be reminded 3 times for my coffee.

The only thing that makes me happy here is the SPA. Great massage and friendly staff. Thank you very much.

With such competition among hotels in Bali, this is a complete failure and irresponsibility.  Being an elite member of Marriott hotels and having extensive experience traveling around the world, this hotel is not worth the money and 5 stars.","Amazing experience!! Initially we stayed at other hotel where is located at near around potato head beach club but it was so terrible- mould smell, and dusty so we pulled an all the night. We decided to move to courtyard. In general, the room condition was perfectly clean and cosy - even all pillows have aroma fragrance ü•∞ - it helped me to sleep so well! - highly recommend!!","My family and I stayed 7 nights at Courtyard Seminyak. This was our second holiday here. I can highly recommend this hotel. Everything including the rooms, pool and pool bar, the amazing breakfasts at Seminyak Kitchen and first class service was faultless! A special thank you to the warm and wonderful Eka who made us feel like VIP‚Äôs. We will not forget your outstanding hospitality! Many thanks, see you next time!","My wife and I had an amazing three-night stay at this hotel. Right from the start, the staff upgraded our room to a beautiful garden view, which was a nice surprise. üòä The room was clean, cozy, and smelled really good. The refreshing scent added to the comfort of our stay

The hotel had awesome facilities like a gym, table tennis, pool bar, and swimming pool. We especially loved the pool bar's deal of buy one, get one free on cocktails. üçπ The breakfast buffet had a great variety of delicious options. üëçüèª

All the staff were friendly and attentive. A big shoutout to Dino from housekeeping, who made my wife's day by creating a cute towel elephant decoration in our room. Overall, this hotel definitely deserves a 5-star rating for their excellent service and well-trained team. üëçüèª"

Broken soap dispenser pictures missing or stolen off walls (room photos paint such a nice picture.....not so.....don't believe the ad pictures about this place).
Breakfast area dingy with dirty tables and floors. Manned by two young males more intent on playing with their phones than clearing and cleaning used tables etc. Dirty disgusting area which doubled as a junk and cleaning equipment storage. Food cold and looks like yesterdays. Wish we hadn't added breakfast as there are plenty of places out on the streets. The pool isn't even worth a mention.

Receptionist, right. It doesn't Metter what person could say at the reception: I am her brother/husband/son or friend, she left her phone and I am here to bring it back. You must ask the guest.

But just because it is cheap does not make it worth it.

DO NOT LISTEN TO THE 5 star reviews the are not being honest with you.","The staff is very rude, especially the uncle with glasses that works reception in the evenings. Do yourself a favor and don't ruin your holiday by booking this hotel. You will not be able to sleep due to poor sound insulation. There are many other options in the area in the same price range."

The food serving time is very fast,there is free entertainment, dance at the night can enjoy while eating.","I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at this Indonesian restaurant in Bali. The taste of the food was exceptional, offering a delightful burst of flavors. The restaurant's ambiance created a fantastic vibe, and the staff were exceptionally friendly, enhancing the overall atmosphere. However, I was slightly disappointed as some dishes weren't served warm, and not all menu options were available. Despite these minor setbacks, the positive aspects made it a memorable visit.",I‚Äôm in shock at how many high reviews they have because it‚Äôs definitely not worth more than 1 star. even the Indonesian food was average. food was bland. McDonald‚Äôs is better than this. Atmosphere was okay with the dancing. $8 tax. you should definitely eat somewhere else.,"We came here in a group of 10 for dinner. The atmosphere was awesome. It was open, spacious and windy. The service was extremely good and the waitress recommended a lot of good food for us to try.

We ordered pizza, tomyum, chicken satay, pork satay. All of them were amazing. The pizza was thin and crusty. The portion size was good as well. We all felt very satisfied and delighted after the meal.

This is a very good place to chill with friends. There are also performances while we ate and they were very entertaining.

Highly recommended restaurant to try out when you come here in Bali. Will definitely come here again when I come back to Bali","We went here to eat the famous Nasi Campur Bali for lunch. The restaurant was not too full, so I could enjoy the traditional ambiance and the nice weather. The Nasi Campur was not too spicy and a bit bland for Indonesian food. Maybe they tone down the spices because many tourists eat here. A bit too pricey for a plate of nasi campur. It was still delicious and can be one of my go-to restaurants if I want to enjoy not-too-spicy and fancy Nasi Campur."

The hotel's proximity to the beach is beatable, allowing for easy access to breathtaking sunsets and refreshing swims. What truly sets this hotel apart is its incredibly warm and welcoming staff. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with genuine smiles and helpful assistance, making me feel like a valued guest. The atmosphere at Harris Hotel is so inviting that it truly feels like a home away from home. Whether it was enjoying delicious meals at the on-site restaurant or relaxing by the pool, every moment was filled with comfort and joy. I cannot recommend Harris Hotel enough for anyone looking for a delightful stay in Seminyak.","The hotel's location is fantastic, situated in the heart of Seminyak, providing easy access to the vibrant local scene.

The staff at Hotel Harris Seminyak were consistently friendly and attentive, making me feel welcomed throughout my stay. The rooms were clean, well-maintained, and offered a comfortable retreat after a day of exploring the island.

One highlight was the hotel's pool area, which provided a relaxing oasis. The on-site restaurant served delicious meals, offering a mix of local and international cuisine, satisfying various tastes.

However, one aspect that could be improved is the hotel's use of single-use cosmetics. In an era where sustainability is paramount, a shift towards eco-friendly and refillable options would greatly enhance the hotel's commitment to environmental responsibility.

While the hotel provides a peaceful atmosphere, it's worth noting that some parts might benefit from a bit of refurbishment to enhance the overall aesthetic.","We had a wonderful stay at Harris Hotel on our last night in Bali. The room was incredibly spacious, well equipped and clean and the location for exploring the city is perfect. The hotel itself is very modern and the service is great. A special thank you to Arif at the reception, who was incredibly nice and made our stay even more enjoyable. If we ever come back to Seminyak I would not hesitate to book here again.","Its a decent accommodation with very good value for money. Its situated closer to the main center (Seminyak Square & beach). If you are the kind where you are on an exploratory path leaving in the morning & returning in the evening / night & need a decent place to rest, this suits you well. We stayed with the family & it aptly served our purpose. They also have 2 times shuttle to the beach & Seminyak square. The breakfast was decent with live counters. Sometimes, the veg options gets challenging & you can request them for veg preparation eg: Veg Nasi Goreng (Fried Rice), which will be prepared fresh. Staff were courteous. They also have their own Pizza place in the same building which was a convenience with the kids. You can walk to the main street, have a great time & walk back if your energy & fitness levels are good. Overall, a good value proposition place.

Better veg options will surely boost the experience to cater to the vegetarian crowd or else you are down to just fruits, vegetables, salad, bread jam & desserts which has been an universal truth in most of the places.

Overall, a good value proposition place - decent accommodation, breakfast & proximity to the center.","We stayed here as a last moment change due to bad experience at other accommodation.
All staff from security, reception to other staff at the hotel 10/10.
The rooms and hotel a little run down and could do with an upgrade, but in all this is a good place to stay. Stayed with my wife and two kids."

Although the rooms were small they were clean, staff were very friendly, and went out of their way to ensure we had a great stay! Our first night we had an issue with our aircon, they immediately sent the electrician to fix the problem and when we felt it still wasn't cold enough they swapped our rooms immediately. They handle every situation so well and so professionally. I stayed at a few other places around Bali for the same price and this was by far the best value for money, and the best breakfasts out of all the places we stayed.

I would definitely stay here again.","The rooms were smaller than expected with nowhere to put our suitcases out of the way.  Also we would recommend asking for a quiet room, away from the road and not above the restaurant as music was quite loud in our room. The bed was comfortable though. We would highly recommend their restaurant. Possibly the best food we had on our holiday.","The Hotel is actually very nice, the staff is very friendly and Care about the customers.

This is obviously an automated response, as I have spoken to the manager about it","Love my peppermint tea and buckwheat waffles served in beautiful cup and plate. Service wise, lady staff who took our order was helpful and friendly, but not the other guy staff, find him not very responsive, when my Japanese friend asked him if there were nuts in the smoothie bowl, he said something (as if he is too lazy to speak up) and pointed to the menu.

Food is nice and my tea and husband's long black (according to him) were good. More to the pricey side for the food, just the waffles, it's already 90K."

I don't like the way a waiter asking me for drink, giving me the change and staring at me as if I'm a dumb. I like the drag queens and their performance are awesome! Free entrance is very interesting. Small space but nice. Still great for dancing and enjoying the music.","The drag show was fantastic! Drinks were reasonable.  Keep in mind that this is an open bar, so it can get hot and humid.",Great drag queens but steer absolutely clear of any cocktails. Was violently ill after a Long Island iced tea that tasted like gasoline.

The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the food was fresh and delicious. The rooms were beautifully decorated, spacious, and very clean and so were all facilities, and the pool and restaurant were amazing and perfectly positioned to watch the sunsets. The staff even left me a surprise birthday cake in my room. I highly recommend the Pelangi Bali Hotel.","A long time visitor to Bali, but first time at Pelangi - silly me... Firstly, location, location, location - right on the beach in Seminyak. Easy distance to shops and restaurants. Secondly, and more importantly, the staff were exceptional. I stayed over Nyepi, and there was always friendly and helpful service, even though many of them were unable to be with their own families for this sacred celebration. Finally, I had a great room, with a full sized bath, and a view towards the pool and the ocean beyond.

Oh, and the restaurant was great for breakfast and dinner, with the amazing ocean view, plus room service was great and quick when needed.

Before I left, after a 10 night stay, I rebooked for 7 months time, and am so looking forward to returning. Thank you for a memorable stay.","Although the hotel is quite old and a little tired looking, for a beachfront hotel in Seminyak, it is excellent value.  The rooms were clean, comfortable and spacious and the bathroom had a massive rainforest shower. The pool is large, has plenty of lounge chairs and a well stocked swim up bar.

I highly recommend the hotel Spa.  The 90 minute hot stone massage was perfection and guests get an additional 30% off all spa services - so you bet I was there every day.

Located right on the beach the hotel is within walking distance of Canggu and everything that Seminyak has to offer and is a short taxi ride to Kuta / Legion.",Great service from all hotel staff who were very helpful and friendly. Pool was great and had beach side views. Breakfast was also very nice everyday. I was disappointed about the cleanliness of the rooms which could be improved.,"Stayed for couple of days after staying in Ubud for 3 days. Had exactly opposite experience here in Pelangi as compared to Ubud.

I reached around 1:30 pm for check-in. Even though there were couple of staffs at entrance, no welcoming. They did not bother to ask if they need to pick up the luggage - my driver delivered it.

Reg check-in - they were so particular that they didn't want to give the room even a minute before 2pm, stated a reason room is under cleaning.

Overall ambience of reception was pretty dull and stuffy. Corridors were really run down.

Room was decent, they provided 2 beds as requested. Washroom was decent but water was flowing continuously in the western flush. Informed but no action taken.

Aircon did not work even at 18 degrees, we complained post which it was rectified. Still 18 degrees felt like 24/25 degree - feedback was given.

Breakfast - pretty ordinary, nothing great. We mentioned vegetarian during booking and check-in - could not find anything good though. Staff tried to help us with a vegetarian noodles but the 1st smell made us not too eat.

Day 2 - suddenly water started leaking from Aircon. We complained and they told it was fixed but I'm 5 mins again same problem. Informed front desk during check out.

Overall not a good experience staying at Pelangi"

I've eaten here more than once now and it's great every time. The pics are of the garlic bread, wagyu beef Ragu with rigatoni and the wild habit pizza.","The steak was great, bang for the buck! We enjoyed our stay. From the juice to the salad, it was awesome. We were just randomly checking a good restaurant around Seminyak that serves steak and we found this one with good reviews so we decided to dine in here. Special shout out to Ita for doing an excellent job. For always checking up on us if we need anything. :)","Came here because of the good reviews and it did not disappoint! We got the wagyu rigatoni, a margarita pizza, a tea, and a beer for just over 300k and it was well worth. The pasta was perfectly cooked and flavourful, but the real highlight was the pizza. The sourdough base was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside, marinara was bursting with tomato flavour, cheese was stretchy, basil was fragrant - genuinely one of the best pizzas I‚Äôve ever had. The beer was a perfect match for the meal. They also had a wide range of other alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks to choose from. Do reserve a table in advance as they get quite busy!

Have a good motorcycle parking space, but not many car parking space because the car will be park on the access road to the hotel.

Room wise the size is decent. Need improvement on cleaning the bedside tables and table because the material is textured wood, so a bit dusty and keeping dirt.

It would have been great to have a fridge to use to keep your drinks and food cold. I left pizza out for 15mins and it was covered with ants.

We stayed in a standard room and were so surprised at how big it was. The outdoor shower and bathroom were actually amazing. Breakfast was great. There are only a few main meal items to choose from, but we were always so full. You would get a bread basket each, juice and hot beverage of choice, and a fruit bowl. And on top of that your main meal. The pool was great and it was never busy. Highly recommended üëå
Can not wait to go back.","Incredible.
Stayed here with my son and my mum‚Ä¶ unfortunately only for 3 nights. I wish we stayed here for our entire trip.
It is so quiet you‚Äôd swear you were far from the hub, but within a 5-10 minute walk to the main drags. Shops and restaurants just outside the facility‚Ä¶.
The food (breakfast) is a set menu, I‚Äôm a buffet girl personally but given how delicious and the quality of this menu I was not fazed. We are foodies and the food here blew us away. Absolutely phenomenal.
The rooms are so clean, smell amazing, serviced once in the morning and once in the evening at sundown. The attention to detail and want to cater for your every need is impressive. The decor is quirky and simple with gorgeous hand painted art and the beds, so comfortable.
I had a complimentary massage given by the hotel and it was hands down the best I‚Äôve ever had. Diah has magical hands. I highly recommend. Sadly I didn‚Äôt get time to have another treatment‚Ä¶
The staff go above and beyond, they meet any request and the attention and assistance I received with my 1.5 year old son was remarkable. The staff were so attentive with my boy allowing me to actually be able to relax by the pool and have a spa treatment without getting up to tend to him every 30 seconds. I‚Äôd honestly feel safe leaving him with them they were that good.
I recommend this beautiful quiet resort to anyone, couples, friends or families.","We spend two nights here and were great. We stayed in a double bedroom pool villa. The bedroom was quiet, comfy, beautifully decorated and clean. The pool was awesome to refresh, as the main one in the hotel.

The staff was really nice, the breakfast really good and we even had a romantic dinner, and it was really good experience.

15 min walk to the beach, a great choice!","I had stayed here from April 13th for 5 nights, amazing property, spacious room clubbed with the  great location and great staff. Right from booking i had asked few questions over email and had received prompt reply, check in went incredibly smooth. I liked the online checkin flow.
Staff here are really good and they always carry a smiling face and this itself makes conversation easy.
I had faced issue with AC water leak but it was rectified immediately.
Location is the big advantage, its in the main area, lots of shopping places and eateries nearby.
Walking distance to the Seminiyak beach.
I would recommend this place and given a chance would love to stay again here.
Simple and sublte things like Welcome home written on the bed and when staff say the place as home, somehow we had found home in a different country.
One suggestion : Include some indian food in your menu.

Thank you Blue karma team for making our stay amazing."
