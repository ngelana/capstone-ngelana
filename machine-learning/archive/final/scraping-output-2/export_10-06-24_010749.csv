When you enter Ceningan and make a left after the bridge, you end up here.","No shops, cafes or life. Just a big empty building. They really should think on infrastructure unities.",You‚Äôll get to view the straits between both island and the opening to the sea. Mangrove forest nearby.

The warm welcome made us feel right at home. The simple yet charming cottages were a delight, and the breathtaking pool view was truly unforgettable. The owner and their family were incredibly kind and accommodating. The wife's cooking was a highlight, with each meal being absolutely delicious. We can highly recommend this place if you are looking for a peaceful and quiet time. Can't wait to return!","My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights and it was absolutely wonderful. Joe and his family are so incredibly kind, warm and welcoming and the place itself is absolutely stunning. It‚Äôs within a good distance for shops (not that there are many on the island), the beach and the beach clubs and you‚Äôre able to hire a scooter or a taxi too.

Thanks so much Joe!","The photos simply do not do this place justice! What a treat this was! Stayed here for a week with a friend. We were looking for a quiet, comfortable place and this one delivered beyond our expectations.

The property is beautiful, well taken care of, clean and very nicely designed, inside and outside the rooms. Everything is spacious, the decor is lovely, the beds are supremely comfortable, the rooms smell fantastic, and the landscaping is excellent.

The hosts are excellent. Kind, welcoming, attentive and friendly. You can tell they understand good hospitality.

You do probably need a scooter to get around the island a bit, but it is well worth it for the high vantage point looking over Nusa Penida. Will stay again for sure!","We booked it via air BNB, it should be an amazing beginning of our holidays. However, when we arrived and they just cancelled booking without any reason. Staff was trying to help us but he even don‚Äôt know the wifi password. For thanking his help, we ordered some drinks and waiting outside of villa just in case he was too busy to do any services.
Local people are very kindhearted and help us to move to other place. Still highly recommended it but maybe no more staying here.",Really nice place and sweet family. Beds are super comfy and the cottages have nice wooden interior with clean bathrooms. No risk of mold since it's all new construction. Pool and view are amazing.

While we were waiting for the boat, we heard loud music and parrots screaming/chirping.  When we looked, we found two different species of parrots sitting chained on poles in a corner of the PapaRocky Restaurant, with loud speakers playing loud music next to them.  There was no guest in the restaurant at that time. I contacted the staff, who told me that they had been in the restaurant for three months.  I cannot rate the restaurant with its food and service!  The assessment is based solely on the conditions in which the animals are kept.  No tourist in the world can want that!!!  I implore the owner to change this situation and either return the animals to their natural environment or organize species-appropriate keeping!","Paparocky Restaurant & Beach Club is a popular spot in Nusa Penida, Bali, known for its stunning ocean views, delicious food, and vibrant nightlife. Located on the beachfront, the restaurant offers a relaxed atmosphere with friendly staff and a variety of seating options, including tables and chairs, beanbags, and swings.

The menu features a diverse range of dishes, catering to both Western and Indonesian palates. Guests can indulge in fresh seafood, succulent grilled meats, and flavorful vegetarian options. The restaurant also boasts an extensive cocktail list, perfect for enjoying while watching the sunset over the ocean.",nice place for partyüëåüèª,,

The room was amazing and the bathroom just stunning. The infinity pool overlooking the forest was great - especially if you‚Äôre looking for a more quiet place outside of the main buzz.

The staff was very friendly and helped us organize a taxi. We rented scooters to get around the island.

There is lots of centipedes (also in the room
and bathroom) but we were facing the same across other accommodations around the island so just be aware.

Would definitely recommend to stay there!","Quiet, away from the noise but still 7 mn from the beach by scooter. Cview can host up to 12 guests.",Beautiful boutique hotel. One 4 bedroom villa and 2 bungalows share a fabulous infinity pool.,So chill out there no one to bother.,What a great place

Owner is very nice, the prices are very reasonable.
Had no problems bringing the wooden artwork back through customs in Australia, all inspected and no issues.
If you are looking for something different from the usual tourist stuff, then take the few minutes to drive to the other side of the island to this gallery.",Lovely old man that runs the place. Great art and carvings at very reasonable prices.,"Stunning gallery with authentic local artwork and some antics at very reasonable prices. The owner doesnt speak much english but we still managed to interact and understand a bit of the work he does with his brothers and his son. Very satisfying to know that your money supports true local artists, and very refreshing to find a shop that is actually worth wandering in!
Suksmaüôè","Beautiful little art gallery run by a family of wood carvers and a painter (three brothers and one of their sons). Original works of art carved from recycled wooden canoes, tree knots and roots. Antique carvings from older homes and colourful oil paintings on canvas. All pieces are priced reasonably for their handcrafted, one-of-a-kind designs. This is a must-see for art collectors and travelers looking to support local Lembongan artisans. Well worth the walk or short drive from Jungutbatu Village.",
