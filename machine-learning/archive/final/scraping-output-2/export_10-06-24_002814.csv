This resort is located in a beautiful quiet are of Bali and it‚Äôs great to get away and just be in nature.

We also really enjoyed the facilities the resort had to offer such as the Spa, the cafe and the activities you can plan right from the resort.

This resort offers activities like guided tours, jungle walks and you can even have afternoon tea! ü´ñ

But I think our favorite part was just how friendly the team and the hospitality is, no matter what you need they are there to make sure you have the best possible time. ‚ù§Ô∏è

We really enjoyed our time here and can‚Äôt wait to come back again soon!","Great location for a quiet stay. We stayed in a private pool villa. The villa was elevated, the pool small but perfect for a cool down. There's nothing around but the restaurant provides all meals, alcohol and snacks. The beds were a bit hard for me, but that's just my preference. The staff were awesome","KusFarm is more than a resort. It is one of the most beautiful resorts we have ever been to. It's heaven on earth. We felt like in a movie. Perfect environment for rest and relaxation. Their environment and culture will literally absorb you. Perfect hospitality! We were very sorry that our vacation ended, but we believe that we will return there one day. Don‚Äôt miss the Yoga class! ‚ù§Ô∏è","KUSFARM is the best hotel, the staff is very friendly and always they have a smile face. 100% recommend, the spot is like the pictures and better.

Thank you. For sure I come back.","It was a wonderful moments for us at Kusfarm. The Bungalow with its little private pool was amazing. The complex itself is very cool, with the river access, another pool and the yoga area in the middle of the Jungle.

We were also very happy to share a moment to learn how to make offerings with Ayu. It was lovely to spend this time with her !"

The food is tasty,  even though I think it needs more kicks in it. For example more variant in the greens/ side salad. For me, personally, mixing only lettuce and cucumber in the salad  is not appetizing. üòÑ

The staff are friendly and informative, even for a local guest.
I noticed the cafe staff found a bit of a difficulties in explaining the menu.
Since most of the guests are foreigners, I think more english training is necessary for them.","Lovely cafe where you can sit and relax. Enjoy the soft music, koi‚Äôs and water falling.

Had a stay at the Kusfarm Bali so explored a lot of their menu. I can recommend their Tempeh Broccoli Bowl, Big portion and very tasty.

Only thing to mention is please make this restaurant Smoke Free, everytime the disgusting smell of sigarettes while eating.

The chicken teryaki was nice as well, order it with a starter because its salad and chicken and may not be enough.

Beef Rendang is very spicey, but also of high quality. Smaller portion as well.

Overall the portions are bit smaller, but the more space you have for a dessert

Breakfast is very nice as well, go discover that one yourself if you stay at the farm.

Prices are good with a variation from 30k to 120k.",This Spaghetti Carbonara is delicious and creamy! Definitely coming back for more!,"It's tasteful, the vegetables are fresh ‚ú®",A glass of banana chocolate smoothies in the morning. I love itüå∏üòç
