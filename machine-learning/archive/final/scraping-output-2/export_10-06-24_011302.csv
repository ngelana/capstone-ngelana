In this island you can find various exotic animals which are preserved. You can also see python and take photos with it. Big reptiles and bats .
Very old more than 700 years old big turtle is what ia best thing you can see here. They have preserved these animals in very good way .","Definitely i reached this place by accident. But everything is wonderful. The view, the cliff, is amazing. Can't reach the beach because it is located at the bottom, and the wafe is rough","This is a viewpoint with an option to hike more down but not a beach in sight, on the road next to the small temple you can drive on a rocky road over the several cliffs which gives you some nice scenery and view point over each side",Amazing view. So much beauty
