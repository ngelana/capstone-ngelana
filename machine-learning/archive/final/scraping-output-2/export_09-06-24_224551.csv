ChIJuywvxL_30S0RjGxyb36Skw8,Trunyan Hill,-8.2491562,115.4292009,"QC2H+8MP, Songan B, Kintamani, Bangli Regency, Bali 80652, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=1122401803878689932,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.6,232,,"We went here after sunrise. You had to hike up about 700 meter altitude. It's a nice view from above but unfortunately a lot of plastic garbage on the side of the tracks and at the camping places. So sad to see that nobody cares to clean and do something about it. It's going to be ruined soon or later if people in the village or the visitor didn't do something about it. Although Still, they charge you for entrance fee. The price for locals is 10k and 25k for foreigners. From the pictures you didn't see any garbage as I was trying to capture just the good sides of the place.

If you ever plan to hike Trunyan Hill these days, please bring dog food with you. There was a mommy dog who just gave birth to 3 puppies and she hid her babies in a small cave on the right side of the track about 200 metres before the summit.","Found this hike when searching for hike around Batur on google. The Indonesian review said it was less touristy and that is exactly true. We only saw one other foreigner on the hike and looks like she has done this before. Wonderful view of lush mountains and of Mt and lake Batur as you climb.

1. To get there, after arriving at Kintamani main intersection follow directions to Trunyan hill start point. The road along southeastern side of the lake is not well maintained and can have puddles at some parts in rainy season. We hired a car to get us there as we were going to Bedugul afterwards. There are just local villages along the way, so make you bring water.

2. When arrived at Trunyan hill hike starting point around 8am, we saw a lot of motorcycles and some young ppl who already came down. Probably having gone up early to watch sunrise. There is a metal sign says “Trunyan hill hike”.

3. As we climbed, by the way, no one was asking for money as ticket, we saw more young ppl coming down and a couple of local women carrying heavy bags with just flip flops on their feet. It was steep and we were concerned with coming down later.

4. Took us about 1.5 hr to reach the ridge. We were a bit slow, pausing to rest quite a few times and take photos. At the ridge, there is a simple stand for water and local snacks and ticket booth for the hike further up along the ridge. The guy wanted to charge my friend and I IDR 50000 instead of 10000 for each of us. I said we are locals, too. How else would we have found this hike? He didn’t insist on overcharging us than the locals. I do wonder why there should be a charge at all.

5. The hike along the ridge award you with even better view of Mt and lake Batur! We just walk along ridge for a little bit as we are constrained with time and we were already happy with the views we already got.

6. We found some sticks to help our descent as it can be slippery with the steep path.

I recommend this hike to get off the touristy beaten path.",Trail was not very well maintained. Trash was scattered along the path. It's so sad to see that tourists are not protecting nature. Trail is also very dangerous during the rain. We sadly couldn't complete this hike due to bad weather. Trail became slippery and a mud river. We had to dodge left and right in order to get back to the trailhead. Fell a few times. Just be aware due to safety concerns. Would've preferred proper resting/stopping facilities in case of poor weather.,"Got there last weekend.
Despite of the bad weather, the view still amazing.
For sure will come back again in dry season.

It took us about 2.5H to the camp site from the basecamp in Desa Trunyan.
From the campsite to the top was about 30 minutes.
So in total, if you want to do it in one day (no camping so your belonging will much lighter too), I think you can do it for 2.5H.
But for beginner (who doesnt do workout or active) maybe it will took you 3-4H.

But it’s really worth it.
You need to visit it!!!","Beautiful hills.. nice views, you can see the lake and batur volcano so clearly from this hills.. starting point from Temple Pancering Jagat, need around 3 hours hike to the peak,, but last time we tried to continue hike to the Mt. Abang.. the trekking path so challenging!!! But worth it!!"
