I could hear each word started from 6:30 am. And there is a mosque near so be ready also wake up at 4 am from praying sound. I couldn't relax and sleep well. Anything else is not great but suitable. Just now I was checking out and of course I was charged for juice extra for breakfast, but the funniest thing that the woman who works in the kitchen was trying to charge 20 k for orange juice however I paid 15 k yesterday and in menu it's 15 k ,so she said it's fresh so it's 20 k.

Disgusting response from staff.
Why have a bath in a room if you can't full it?
Some people holiday for many reasons, honeymoon for one or maybe as in this case my wife was pregnant and we booked this place so she could get some comfort in a nice hot bath.","We had an awesome time at West Break, it‚Äôs beautiful and calm and spacious. Everything is clean and the staff is super nice and happy to help with all kinds of requests. Boy and Eco took us surfing at the point and balian beach and really helped us improve our skills.

They have had long years experience in surf coaching and they really go the extra mile to make their students feel safe in the water, help you with video feedbacks to improve, they are super fun and patient in the water, also cheer with us when we make progress!

we stayed for 5 days (wish we had stayed longer..) and on the weekend there was a party with friends and family, not only did we we got invited to the party, the whole gang are so welcoming and invited us to dance, eat and drink with them! we had a blast!

also the hotel is one of the nicest we stayed in! beautiful garden and pool, also the chill lounge is very comfy with a nice couch and I could even do my yoga routines here. and they offer the best massages! The staff is beyond nice and sweet, Boy‚Äòs wife Linda is a great cook and served us fresh seafood and fish! The rooms have very comfy beds, hot showers and everything you need. we loved it!

we can‚Äòt be more grateful for this experience with west break crew and family!! this is where you are not a tourist anymore, you are welcomed into their family and taught how to surf on the waves they grew up with, you sit with them enjoying a good family dinner. and dont you worry about the transfer from/to your next destination, they will take care of everything.

don‚Äòt hesitate to come here and meet this wonderful corner of Bali and these heartwarming people!"

I got stuck where the waves break and couldn‚Äòt get out anymore. No one checked in on me, they just went out further to take their own waves, I felt like I almost drowned. Ever since I am afraid to go surfing, I really can‚Äôt recommend to any person that is not a surf dude who doesn‚Äôt care about anyone else.

Full Review
4 of our group stay in 2 air-conditioning room on the top. The rooms are fine, but the bed looks old. The bathroom are outside and they have sink to wash our eating utensils. They also provide a bathtub outside.
My friend stay in 1 wooden room. It's pretty cute, the bathroom attached to the room and its outside kinda bathroom. The picture show the room from the outside. The bathroom picture is provided in this page by other people (not in this comment).
Me and the other 9 are staying at 5 rooms on the three stories building, no AC but it's quite cold at night. I provide the picture of my room. We stay during Nyepi day and the rain pouring all day. It leaks in many spot, and there are no staff at the moment so I have to dry my room by myself. But as you see from the picture, the view is really nice, the price is super cheap. For that kinda price hotel, I would give 5 stars if it's not raining. But I feel like 3 star because of the leaking. So in average I give 4 instead.
They give a delicious pancakes with honey, and the restaurant is by the beach. I really having a good time here.
I will suggest the owner maybe to change the bed in the air conditioning room, maybe nicer color, that blue bed just seem not appealing and old. Provide better stove, and probably a table on the non-AC room. Because I put all my stuff on the floor and the floor got wet because of the rain, luckily it haven't reach my stuff. If there is a table, I'll be less worried. Thank you.",had a amazing stay at Anara! the hostess is really friendly and the location is awesome.
