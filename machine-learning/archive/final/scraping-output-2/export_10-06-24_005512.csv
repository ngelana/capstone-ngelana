My friends & family & I are so thankful we ended up here after having to leave our previous hotel. I can’t say enough good things - the rooms are great, the pools are great, and the food is great. The breakfast buffet has thousands of options, and the dinner menu is great. The rooms aren’t anything crazy, but they are clean, spacious, and have a nice balcony. What really sets this hotel apart is the staff. Every single employee, from the check in staff to the cleaners to the cooks are so pleasant. We were a party of 6, and they knew us all by name, knew our coffee orders and knew our room numbers. They are incredibly polite and go above and beyond to help with anything. The shuttle to Ubud is a great touch, as is the complimentary water. We were due to leave this hotel to head further north, but decided to extend our stay by two nights due to the amazing experience. After hundreds of hotel stays, this is for sure a top-10 worldwide. Special thanks to Gayatri at the breakfast buffet for her kindness and attention.","I had a fantastic 4 night stay here. Beautiful location and property. The breakfast is 10/10. The restaurant and bar foods are also very good. The rooms clean and great size, loved having a balcony.
The level of hospitality offered by staff is incredible. They were all so personable and remembered my name, how I liked my coffee, my room was restocked with extra coffee and towel animals with cute little messages. The staff really did make my experience here.

The hotel itself isn’t in walking distance to center of Ubud but the shuttle service is so nice. You get dropped off and picked up at the same location which has a very nice supermarket, it’s perfect for grabbing anything you may need for back at the hotel.
However; the pools, restaurant, and bar are really nice at Sthala, perfect if you don't feel like going anywhere a day. There are also two cafes, one across the street I didn’t get to try but I did walk to SCENT coffee down the street and got a beautiful cocktail and a snack one evening.
Thank you for the wonderful stay!","I had the pleasure of staying that hotel  for two nights, The hotel provided a stunning ambiance and the breakfast was absolutely good. What made the experience even more exceptional was the incredibly friendly and helpful staff. They went above and beyond to ensure my stay was perfect. Overall, it was an unforgettable experience that exceeded all my expectations.
sasha","Stayed here for three nights. I had no issue other than the towels are too smelly of bleach, pillows are rather hard (if your preference is soft) and breakfast is rather dull despite a range of choices. The machined coffee is strong so watch out. Staffs were great; they are very welcoming.","I wish this hotel was my home. We stayed here for a too short time of 2 nights and we had a great time. We especially loved the staff, everyone was so kind to us and helpful. We also loved the pools, the food, the decor, the room and the mocktails. We loved it all and would 100% come back. Ubud as a town is also a nice and interesting place to discover. 10/10"

The hospitality was outstanding; before we had even been taken to our room a friendly staff member brought us complementary limeade! The location was stunning and the whole place had so many interesting pockets to explore: multiple pools overlooking a river, beautiful carvings and extra touches like a pool table and small gym setup. Our room was very clean and the staff were never intrusive. Bad reviews mentioning lots of bugs are overblown and seem to miss the fact that the villa is situated over a river; just bring some bug spray and you’ll be fine. Everyone who worked there went above and beyond. I could go on and on! Would highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Ubud.","Theme Park Castle Gone Wrong…

A lovely swimming pool and river view. I enjoyed the  outdoor lounge as the veranda chairs were interesting (in the castle theme park aesthetic) but not comfortable to sit on. I thought the mermaid shower with the stone used as a tap was charming. My daughter enjoyed two of what she described as ""best in Asia"" massages at the pool however the poor massage therapist kept getting interrupted by guests dining at the pool asking for cutlery or water which then ruined the experience. A very strange set up. This venue which is run by a family that might of travelled but have zero experience in running an establishment.
The effort was put into the original ""design"" and
then stopped right there. A strong impression that they have lost interest in being in the hospitality industry.

88 stairs at uneven levels to get up and down to your unit - so this is not ideal for persons suffering with any knee issues. The property is very rundown - when we first arrived we thought we had the wrong venue. Weeds, plastic bottles, smelly hot dogs (my heart broke) that belong in Alaska chained with no water bowls, a strange smell and junk lying around the entrance floor.

The area seemed dodgy - a building site with windy, dangerous pothole roads. We then arrived at the ""theme park"" library area where we ""met"" the owner for a two second glance. He had been pontificating in an American accent about how hated a guest speaker had been at some convention. We then noticed the odd Al screen that replicated what looked like the owner - the creepiest thing we have ever seen!

The young girl working at reception was friendly and took us on the grand tour of a property that has seen better days. Such a huge pity, the river view gives this venue an edge and some serious design work was put into the creation of the ""castle"" however it is now sadly very run down. Our unit was tiny, no space to open our suitcase. Bed linen torn and run down. The bathroom at first looked beautiful but turned out to be a very strange experience. The bath plug leaks so you need to keep water running. No hot water - it was a lukewarm to cold experience. The window looking into the bathroom we later discovered to our disgust allowed the staff standing outside to see the shape of your naked body. The skylight roof
was covered in green mould. The complimentary toothbrush bristles break free into your mouth and the boxes were covered in a thick layer of dust.

You hear the person sneeze in adjacent rooms and our balcony was in arm length to the next unit. No privacy at all. The “gym” is in reception - looks more like it has been put in place for family use when nobody is at the “resort”.

The food app that runs the venue is clever however the food itself was a huge disapointment. Even the fruit salad disappointed - warm fruit served in bowls with hairline cracks, that are chipped. Our 4 day stay left me feeling unsettled - the energy is seriously off and the property is very neglected.",We had a good time here. Rooms are a little dated but served us well. Definitely a very quirky place. Aircon worked well and was definitely needed in the heat. A lot of steps so wouldn’t suit anyone not very mobile,"We stayed hardly there 2 nights. When we arriaved to hotel, they gave us a room made by wooden which was very narrow and dirty and full of insects. Bed was upstairs. Not userfriendly. So we did not want to stay there and talked with them, they changed our room with the better one. But still there were lots of problems, bathroom was open window so there was no clean towels (very bad shampoo together with dush gel), also bedlinens were very dirty, no hairdrier. Surroundings of hotel was terrible, dark and nothing. Like middle of nowhere. Very far away to city center. We even could not reach easily to the market. So I never suggest you this place. You should look for central hotels not Avalon.","Avalon castle was the best stay I ever had. Staff and managers were so polite and humble even  I was given upgraded room as complimentary. Stay was impeccable. It makes you feel you’re living in a real castle. Highly recommended, if you wanted to make your vacations more intriguing and terrific in bali this is the best property you can stay in."

Free entry. Very friendly and knowledgeable guide. The free tasting boards of tea and coffee were so good we bought many of them afterwards in the shop. The Luwak coffee is the smoothest coffee I have ever tasted and I am not the biggest coffee fan but I bought some to take home. You can buy a cup of the Luwak coffee for 50k rp and it is worth it! This place was recommended from our driver and we are so glad we went. I would consider this a must do in Ubud!,"Beautiful place! Actually we went to the kintamani plantation the day before, but we decided to try this place out.

The coffee was really good! They had many pets and there was also a tour of their family home, as this seems to be a family business. I highly recommend this if you want to try luwak but don't want to travel to kintamani. This is well within Ubud area. The coffee testing is free, but luwak is 50k per person. We also like the variety of teas as they offer sugar free options.

Do prepare mosquito repellents!","Negari Luwak Coffee offers a fantastic English tour that's well-explained. The variety of options to try makes the experience enjoyable, and the overall tour is genuinely interesting. Highly recommended for coffee enthusiasts!","The main focus is on Kopi luwak coffee, but it does have a variety of coffee, tea, and cocoa. They have a very interesting tour that shows the process of making the luwak coffee. Well worth a visit!","Rahayu was a brilliant guide from start to finish! She was very friendly and spoke excellent English, we thought she was from the U.K. at one point. The coffee and tea was very good and we were happy with the experience.

The civet cats weren’t under good conditions, with most of them locked in tiny cages. So this is an improvement they should definitely make. However the experience was a nice one and I would recommend."

I am in love with the coffee, unfortunately i didn’t stay near scent so i didn’t have the chance to try the whole menu.

I later found out because Mr Wayan does not post a review of you so they are not published.  So we stuck it out for about 3 weeks so as to not lose all the 'non refundable' payment.  Now I know why it is non refundable,

As others have said, the place is noisy and poorly maintained and the pandemic excuse has expired.  Thinking it would be a popular place, I booked early but we did not see many people.  Some turned up and left after a few hours- -- yes - it was not like the photos at all.

Swing: broken, heart thing: overgrown with weeds: net over river: unusable,  Pagoda: roof gone, bathroom: dirty and smelly. Many amenities on airbnb: BBQ, laundry, iron, oven, the list goes on are nowhere to be found.

There really is nowhere decent to eat in the area - street warungs only. But riding for 15 - 20 minutes we found some nice places: Joglo Krasan and Warung Wasan were a couple of favourites.  Cooking in the kitchen was a challenge unless you choose to pack your own utensils and saucepans.

Breakfast was OK and the girls who served us were very nice but they just work there and they work at another location so you are pretty much on your own.  Another guy seemed to sweep the path and make the beds of departed  and (no doubt) disgruntled guests.  Things did get done - but only after asking.  Gas bottle ran out, water bottle (no dispenser - broken) empty.  And do ask to get the sheets and towels changed when required as that is not done.  Additionally, the pool was so green a couple of weeks in that I asked and it did get some chemicals thrown in but *staff*, please open your eyes.

Any positive reviews on google seem to be from the previous owner.  I even found a dusty drinks menu in the filthy store room.  A memory from yesteryear.","A nice place to stay but it looks very abandoned. Plenty of insects that include big spiders that look frightening. The shower is accessible by the insects as the trunks behind each bungalow grew under the roof so they easily get inside. The beds have little insects also that like to bite humans.
This place is in a deep need to be disinsected before accepting people.
Overall we got one night free out of the four nights we stayed which was lovely, but couldn't cover the discomfort due to the insects.","The place is hidden. Access road is small but you can come by car. It's literally by the river, so the view is amazing. The room itself is tiny but comfy. They have swing too, but during the pandemic it's not operating. When I came, the room was kind of dirty. The staff' response was quick- She cleaned immediately. They only have 4 rooms, so you don't have to worry about the noises next door. However, across the river, there's a bridge road, so it's still noisy (we can see and hear from the room, even when the door is closed). Just like any other tropical places in rainy season, there's a lot of mosquitos. So you need to get ready with your own insect repellent spray or lotion. For what it's worth, this place offers great view, has comfy bed and also provides breakfast.","We arrived to a noise part of ubud(noise from the road and car horns), which was meant to be quiet. The room was nothing like the photos and was really run down. The room was invested with bugs and had ants everywhere. Careful of the door to the room because they lock but have a gap about 10cm wide. We decided to leave the hotel and not even stay for 1 night. I urge anyone not to come !","It's a jungle resort, in the midst of a jungle, when you are in harmony with the nature around you, you won't be affected by the natural beings around you
Book your travel during the stay with them, you will get great rates.

Even the AirBnB owner's restaurant is spectacular with huge portion sizes of food

If you behave like a decent human being, owner is very generous with discounts in rates, whether you get any reductions be nice to the staff.

There is alfamart nearby to buy things you need to make it yourself if you wish to

The VW day tour to coffee plantation, nearby areas are excellent too

When you check in,  check your rooms, eat outside the room in the pantry to avoid ants

They are great kind people with a fun jungle resort feel"

And CVS is near the property on walking street.
But, It's too far from central ubud. It takes about 40-60mins by a car.
There were terrible things I felt during staying here.
1. No answers even though I contacted the property manager and owner for several times a day. > I couldn't get any service such as additional towels as it was impossible to contact with the manager. He didn't get my call and messages. meanwhile, the owner came to her property and asked me whether I know where the manager is. At that time, I asked her additional towels, and she told me she will bring them to me soon. BUT, she didn't come again.
The owner and manager are terrible. I'm sure you will not get any service you need during stay.
2. There were 3 roaches in Room No.4. As you know, if you were to find 3 roaches in your room, it could have a huge amount of roaches in your room. From this happening, I couldn't sleep for even one minute.
3.I got infected by parasite while using the pool. I watched various black things that kept moving like larva in the pool. I threw up 5 times, had diarrhea over 5 times and felt cramping in stomach and tingling sense on both arm, leg and hand. I still have stomach cramps and also spent over 400 dollars to treat.
I know this accommodation is good for staying for over 5 family or friend members.
BUT, I'm sure your journey in bali must be happy. Do not ruin your travel. Reconsider staying here.",Calming . The pool is incredible. Close to the city centre.  Too much insects.. apart from that very good .
