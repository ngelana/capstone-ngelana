As you walk into the hotel an oasis of serenity & tranquility welcomes you. The lobby, villas, restaurant, pool areas - everything looks stunning.    The staff is lovely and the breakfast wonderful. We also went to the main restaurant a few times, including for the BBQ night, and we loved it. We would highly recommend!","Was Paradise for us.
Its been 12 years since we were at The Ubud Village Resort & Spa & it is still beautiful. The villas are divine with their private pool, indoor & outdoor shower, outdoor bath with a pond each side with fish.  Large curving gorgeous pool outside with a bar at one end for either a cocktail or a latte. Shuttle bus to downtown Ubud only 2ks away. Everyone who works there are so friendly. Always with a lovely smile including Piki. Breakfast menu has small changes each day which is nice. Excellent dinner menu.
Massages are divine (had two). We will be returning next year.","My wife and I came here for the first few days of our honeymoon, and we wish we had stayed longer.
Our room was lovely, felt very secluded, and everything was finished to a high standard.
The staff were incredibly friendly and provided a great service.
Location is a little bit outside of ubud, so you will need to arrange taxis in the evening if you want to go out for dinner. There is a free shuttle during the daytime","Everything was amazing. The hotel is the cleanest, most beautiful and friendly place. The staff are so welcoming. I am speechless at how good this place is and could not recommend it higher. It gives you the luxury, space nd privacy that you would expect from a much more expensive hotel.",One of the best hotels we‚Äôve ever been to. And we‚Äôve seen a lot of them. You have your own house with pool and outdoor shower etc. Great people and service all over the hotel. And it‚Äôs located good but not perfect to get into Ubud. But a hotel shuttle helps for getting to the center. We would come back anytime for another timeout here!!

We were here for a 2 night stay and had to leave early morning before sunrise for our pre-wedding shoot so it was really nice to have our breakfast set prepared for our collection at 3am.

There is a design flaw with the bath area because
1. the bathtub does not have a overflow drain;
2. there isn't a floor trap near the bathtub.

So be careful when you are trying to enjoy a hot bath.

The staff's warm and welcoming hospitality creates a positive and inviting atmosphere. There will always be someone by the door welcoming you back to your stay. I would definitely return.","Cleanliness, breakfast, kindness of the staff. They pay attention to everything, meet all your requests. Wonderful hotel, I can only recommend it.
The two cats deserve a special award","My 4-day stay was splendid. I specifically requested a cooler room with good A/C and they delivered. The room was very clean and comfortable and the shower and bath tub were clean and modern. They provide 6 bottles of water per day which comes in handy and they do housekeeping twice per day. They provide a shuttle that can take to into town and also pick you up, it was so easy to schedule and they were pretty quick in their availability. The hotel food options were actually pretty good, lots of sushi then eggs, bacon, sausage western type breakfast options. The staff were very kind and attentive. The public pool area was shaded and a nice break from direct sunlight. Overall I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay. Highly recommend!","My family had a splendid three nights stay at Sabana.
Of the three hotels I stayed in Bali, this is the best! The hotel is well kept, room is clean and bug free (I got bitten badly by mosquitoes in an upscale hotel in Kuta which kept me up all night) and the bed is so comfortable!
The staff at Sabana are the ones who made the difference! Service was excellent and I watched them clean the rooms and surroundings ‚Äî they really take pride in their work and ensure that all everything is clean and comfortable for the guests.
The complimentary shuttle around Ubud is really useful for getting around! It dropped us anywhere around central Ubud and really convenient in getting us around. The staff driver was also able to wait for a while if we are just getting something from the nearby supermarket. Once, the shuttle car was in use by other guests and the staff offered to drop me by scooter! Was a fun experience!
The food served from the in house restaurant was most excellent! We had two dinners there and the food was delicious and price was reasonable! They were also very accommodating to requests for food changes as my kids were picky eaters.
Most importantly, I feel safe in the hotel. It really feels like coming home!","Fantastic location, attentive service, friendly staff, however the way they handled things when I discovered a giant cockroach in my room was inappropriate.

I stayed at Sabana for three nights. On my second night, I discovered a thumb size, flying cockroach in my room. The staff came to catch a immediately, however, it left me feeling very uncomfortable and disgusted as it was crawling all over. I texted the reception manager asking to change rooms, however received no response that night. I approached her the next morning, telling her about the incident again and was told there is no room available. I followed up with another text message asking to have some kind of compensation for my experience and was told she can only offer a one hour massage. When I declined the offer and ask to have one night waved as I will be switching hotels if they cannot change my room, they told me that they actually miraculously found a room on the second floor and moved me over. I had to ask 4 times before my request to change rooms could be done, when in reality it should have been offered to me in the first place when it happened. Everything else about the stay was fantastic, including the breakfast in room service, quick attentive staff. However, I really hope they can improve the way they handle incidents like this in the future."

The turmeric juice with coconut milk is my favorite order, can't believe it tastes so good. You can also opt for soy milk.

I am on gluten-free diet so my lunch was temper mushrooms rendang. I love the beetroot cake (not sweet).

Very nice ambience and quiet.

You can enjoy healthy bowls, amazing sandwiches and green juices! And like many places in Bali, you can get in with your shoes off and enjoy the soothing atmosphere!","This was one of my favourite dining experiences in Bali. Amongst a very tastefully low lot interior we experienced some very attractive and equally delicious food

My favourite was the Mumbai burger. The garlic naan worked very well as a burger, the vege patty was deliciously complex and went very well with the chutney. Highly recommend

The Penang curry was perfectly cooked, the vegetables were so tasty in their own right. Would recommend

The caramel apple cake was nice, the soft fruity parts setting it apart from your usual cake

If you can't already tell, I'm very impressed by this vegan restaurant"

The rooms themselves are very spacious and this is the comfiest bed we‚Äôd stayed in in 6 weeks of holiday/7 different accommodations. The room is cleaned and made up every morning by staff.

Its in Balinese style with a nice and quite atmosphere.  The staff is very friendly and showed me everything. The rooms are very clean and well maintained. Luxury bathroom.

I would definitely recommend to discover the Ubud area.","I enjoyed the aesthetics of Hotel Weda Cita and found the room to be pleasing. However, the cleanliness of the sheets declined after the first day, and I was disappointed when they were only turned over instead of being replaced on day 2. The restaurant's quality is decent but not exceptional. The redeeming factor is the helpful service from the front desk staff. Considering the price, it's acceptable, but there are definite areas for improvement.
The location is also good.","It is beyond me how this resort is only classed as 3 stars they deserve a 4 or 5.  The service was outstanding, nothing too much trouble at all.  A boutique and intimate hotel away from the hustle and bustle snd horrendous car fumes of ubud centre. They offer a shuttle in and out so we found it easy to get around.

To resort owners : please try to put an exhaust fan in the toilet.

- Woke up 2 different nights in a row at 5 and 6am because of heavy working noises caused by cleaning personnel and mechanics outside the room door - had to get up to tell them to stop the noises
- Building and rooms are very old and also dirty, did not feel comfortable in there (especially in bath room), although bed sheets were always clean
- Breakfast was not good, after the first one we skipped the already paid other ones and went to Sage across the street
- Staff at the reception not friendly, not even during check-in - interesting how that is even possible in Bali
- There is no Spa

I gave that feedback also in person to the reception. Better choose a newer, more modern accommodation in Ubud.","Loved this place, it‚Äôs super quiet so not the place if you‚Äôre after a social vibe. Its only 36 rooms apparently over 1.2 Hectares so it‚Äôs bloody huge and it feels like you‚Äôre living in a jungle. There‚Äôs two pools, and the food at the restaurant is great too.

They also have their own ‚ÄúCoworking‚Äù space that‚Äôs usually completely empty, so great place for working, I think it‚Äôs more a converted restaurant area but there‚Äôs power + desks.","Hi peeps,

So this review is based on my personal experience with this hotel. No doubt this hotel infrastructure is very old and also beautiful because you see the river flowing from your room. The pool side has all the amenities, but since this hotel is too old now, these amenities are not getting used.

There are some cons to this place, but I found that it is 33 years old, and since then, it has required repairs.

1. Mosquitoes in the room because the room backside, where the bathroom is situated, is open.

2. Open bathroom and noise from different rooms; the shower is open, and the voice from the side room is clear to you.

3. There is no bar or food near the pool, and there are no other amenities (that do not work) at the pool.

The best part about this place is the staff and the huge area, which is calm and peaceful.",Great location nestled in the hills of Ubud Bali. Was the perfect place to relax and unwind after staying in Kuta. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Food was good but it's not far to some great food in town centre.

Had a lovely experience and the food was deliciousüíù","Absolutely incredible food, that was so good.
I took 2 different meals, 1 avocado smoothie and 1 jamu which is so good I had to share it with an unknown person next to me, I couldn't believe my taste buds.
All for 105k IDR, I strongly recommend it","Wow wow WOW!!! Don‚Äôt miss out on this hidden gem! It is very cozy and serves the best Balinese food I‚Äôve ever tried! Get their award winning dish, Nasi Campur! The owner Ibu is such a sweet lady and makes everything fresh from scratch ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôå"

The staff has always been there for help. The owner stays at the property and she gave us advice of where to visit and also dine in ubud. We also rented scooter from the property, which was also in a very good condition and reasonably priced.
Would love to come back again.","The property is excellent. Placed at perfect location in Ubud. The owner is so humble and friendly. Breakfast is limited but nice and the beat part is the rooms (1 bedroom wooden cottage) and the ambience of the property is amazing.
I would recommend anyone to stay at this place. Totally worth it.",We rented a 1 bedroom villa for 3N that was superb a common pool nearby but only few people in the villa the pool felt like a private pool. Breakfast option needs to be improved drastically. The location is also good.. the best part are the owners soo polite and welcoming.,"Staff were friendly and accommodating, the bungalow was very clean. The bathroom was romantic to shower in open air (but of course be aware you might get bitten by mosquitoes). And the bed comes with a very effective mosquito net for a peaceful night‚Äôs sleep. Breakfast was decent too!","The room was very big, hotel in ubud center, breakfast was good. Cleaning is normal. Crew is very kindly polite people. We have baby and we have suffered 3 good days.

Insects were there in the washroom  because there washroom is open to the garden.  No roof , no door open bathrooms. Instead of refund they demanded us to pay fully. Beware! Not suggested.","Beautiful Villa!üòä
We were in a villa with a shared pool. But the property was very well maintained. Services were great!
Very tidy rooms.
Great staff!
We had to leave early in the morning and they packed us breakfast.
They come in every evening to light up the mosquito coil and give us the mosquito lotion. So there were no mosquitoes in the room.

The only ick was, there was a power outage on the last day of our stay from 5:30 in the morning and it was not fixed for at least 3 hours. There was no water to flush at this point of time.

Other than this, everything was beyond great!‚ù§Ô∏è","It is a really nice hotel with awesome stuff.

The most thing I enjoyed is the cozy, authentic atmosphere in swimming pool area. I really enjoyed spending time there. The stuff is really helpful and kind. The breakfast was enough. I would highly recommend to stay here",Wow such an amazing place. Staff are so helpful...nothing is too much trouble! Close to centre of Ubud by walking through monkey Forest. Just such a relaxing stay. Thank youüôè,"Unfortunately the property did not live up to the expectations and the photos shown are definitely not the reality. We stayed there for 2 weeks as a family of 5.
First of, the WiFi was not good at all. It kept disconnecting constantly and when it did connect it was quite slow. Even after many complaints the issue was not resolved.
The place was spacious, and suitable for a family of 4-6 people, but the furniture was very old, eaten away by termites and mostly worn and shabby. Bed sheets and pillows had a bad moldy smell when we arrived and we asked to change them immediately.
The kitchen was also spacious with many cupboards (again, worn and need adjustments), but with no cooking utensils at all. They only supplied cups, glasses and eating utensils.
Many areas within the property were moldy and unclean, especially inside the villa entrance and around the bathroom showers outside.
We also had to pay for the electricity we utilized which was strange and not reflective of the hospitality of a ‚Äò4-star villa‚Äô as they claim.
The staff on site were friendly and tried to help as much as possible.. which is one of the only plus points We can give here.
All in all, it was a disappointment as we honestly expected the villa to be well equipped, clean, and comfortable. It was anything but. Not recommended."

Very dim lighting in the rooms, so it feels quiet dark in the night.
Only 1 AC in 2 story villa which is not sufficient to cool bali‚Äôs hot weather.
The exhaust in bathroom is missing.
They don‚Äôt refill the tea/coffee packets.
Very limited breakfast options and very little quantity.
You have to ask for water bottle, no mirror in the room, only in bathroom.
No restro in hotel for lunch/dinner.","Terrible staff, can‚Äôt speak English and not helpful.
No aircon, some rooms have a 2kw system for a two story villa which is fk all.

Worst experience in Bali so far",We had a wonderful stay here. The staff were very friendly and helpful and spoke great English. They helped with arranging transport and laundry. The pool was great and my kids loved watching the rabbits roam freely. Lovely location as set back from the road. Easy walking distance to restaurants and shops.

With the exception of construction that was going on at the hotel, sometimes into the evening (angle grinder and drilling, black tap/shower water), whaling babies (who goes on holiday with a newborn?), or obnoxiously loud and drunk Russians staying there, my overall stay was pleasant, private, and accommodating. Rooms are cleaned daily, and appliances all worked, with a decent TV and media stick for Netflix. Great view from my balcony. Staff were awesome. Recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a nice place to stay. Just check that they have completed their renovations before checking in.","Very nice place ! I stayed there 5 nights and really enjoyed my stay. Comfy bed, cleaning was good, the view from the second floor was amazing !
Close to Ubud center but no noise around apart from birds singing, it is lovely üòä","This place is perfect! The room is spacious, clean and comfortable. Hot water, AC, kettle, mini fridge & a TV with Netflix/Prime/Youtube so you can feel truly at home. So close to everything yet so serene and quiet with gorgeous views over the working rice fields & jungle, not to mention a clean and refreshing pool! You can even get breakfast delivered to your balcony to soak up the view or they offer a floating breakfast which is super trendy. The staff go above and beyond to help with a smile. I cannot recommend this place enough!","My favourite stay in Ubud. The price is very reasonable and the standard is good. Nice interior, beautiful bed, bathtub. Feels like a decent western hotel and the rooms are large. Outdoors area is good with a nice pool and a couple of sunbeds.

But I have to say the best part about this place is the guys who run it. They're very friendly and professional, and the owner is so sweet. He'll tell you great stories about Balinese culture and religion - which makes your stay extra special :)",100% value for money.

I definitely recommend lasagna Ragu.","Food is amazing but the service is non existent. No one checks on you. No one notices you. We constantly had to wave or get up to get plates or a spoon or to order another drink. If you‚Äôre okay with that level of service, the food is good. But it‚Äôs on a busy road and there‚Äôs a million bugs. I‚Äôd order this for take out. Not to dine in.","I'm Italian and love this restaurant!
It reminds me of those small ""osterie"": rustic, unpretentious but delicious family run restaurants that are all over Italy.
The food here has exactly the same authentic homemade magic ‚ú®
Delicious in its simplicity.
I had tagliatelle and they were perfect, soft but still slightly chewy (like fresh pasta should be) and the sauce was amazing, with very authentic Italian taste: the sweetness of the tomatoes and the saltiness of the cheese. That's it. üîù
The staff is super kind and professional.
They have a space with ac and an outdoor space on the back of the building, so you don't hear the noise of the road at all. Another highlight is the amazing showcase with fresh cakes and pasta üëå: also typical of Italian family run restaurants, where you can get inspired and choose your dessert.
Highly recommended!","The food was tastefully done, and served well. Portion sizes are good. And the beverages were also well made. The place wasn‚Äôt too busy, and the service was good. Pizza being missing on the menu of an Italian restaurant, came as a surprise.","Ciao Nonna Bali deserves every bit of its 5-star rating! From the moment I stepped in, I was enveloped in a warm and inviting ambiance. The culinary experience was a journey through Italian flavors that delighted my taste buds. The attention to detail in every dish, coupled with exceptional service, made this dining experience truly memorable. A must-visit for anyone seeking authentic Italian cuisine in Bali!"

We had the chips and salsa and they are yummy. Though you only get a few chips there could be more. The salsa that it came with was mild but they bring another salsa which I thought was a refill and it was much spicier. We also had the fajitas and a wet burrito. The burrito could have had more meat and the mix could have been placed better for better bites.
All in all worth a try.","I recently dined at the Mexican restaurant in Ubud, and it was an absolute delight! This restaurant is undoubtedly the best choice for Mexican cuisine in the area. The tacitos were bursting with flavor and had the perfect balance of spices. The nachos were a crunchy and cheesy delight, and I couldn't get enough of them. But the real star of the show was their jalapeno poppers; they were the best I've ever had, perfectly crispy on the outside and wonderfully spicy on the inside. The overall experience was amazing, and I can't wait to go back for more delicious Mexican delights!","We have always had an amazing experience here in the 3 times we have visited.

We enjoyed eating breakfast on our balcony everyday and just sitting back and enjoying the view.  We didn‚Äôt use the free daily Ubud shuttle, but it is available. Overall, I can‚Äôt say enough about Alam Jiwa and really loved our stay.","The Alam Jiwa hotel is potentially one of the most magical hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed in. Those are the very friendly staff, its lovely peaceful location, and its spectacular views.

Upon arrival, a friendly receptionist efficiently checked us in, explaining our stay and the local area. Since we arrived after dark, the full beauty of the surroundings wasn't apparent until sunrise the next morning ‚Äì and what an amazing sight it was!

We stayed in the ‚ÄòGanesha‚Äô room, a second-level haven featuring a beautiful terrace, a spacious bedroom, and an outdoor bathroom with the most stunning shower. It was truly magical to have my morning shower overlooking the rice fields, surrounded by nature.

The extremely comfortable room was decorated in a traditional style that I loved. My favorite spot was the beautiful terrace, perfect for watching the surrounding nature come alive.

While there's no restaurant on-site, Alam Jiwa offers breakfast. You can enjoy it at the reception area, by the poolside, or on your private terrace. The breakfast spread was fantastic and fresh, featuring fruit, fresh breads, and a choice of cooked dishes. The coffee was amazing too.

As mentioned above, the staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful, and really made the stay that extra special.

Alam Jiwa's location was very peaceful, with minimal traffic noise, making it an easy place to explore on foot. We enjoyed the area's culinary scene, and La Cantine and Galle Club were both exceptional.

Overall, Alam Jiwa was my favorite hotel in Bali. The hospitality, the setting, and the area were all exemplary, and my husband and I will look back on our stay with a huge fondness. If you‚Äôre planning on staying in Ubud, I wholeheartedly recommend you stay at Alam Jiwa, it was truly amazing.","Good service with friendly staff.
