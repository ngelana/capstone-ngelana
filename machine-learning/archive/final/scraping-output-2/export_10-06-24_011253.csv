The pool is nice and the staff were really helpful. They have restaurant opening whole day and scooter rental.
They also offer the possibility to book different activities.
Location is so far from the main beaches to see, but still a good trip with motorbike around the roads and jungle views.",Property is very nice and well equipped. We stayed in Triangle house which was very nice and spacious. Food was also very nice and tasty. People working there were very friendly and polite. This place is kids friendly.,"Beautiful property, managed by a family. They're very polite, friendly and helpful. People who are looking for a great villa with excellent view can definitely come here. The sunrise is breathtaking from here.","This property is very good. Rooms are clean and location and views are awesome. Staffs are very friendly and helpful. But 2 things that kept us from giving 5 star. one is water, water that they provide was very salty. we can‚Äôt even able to bath with that water and other thing is their complementary breakfast menu which is very limited. other than that this one is very good.","Amazing staff, great clean and new place.
The towels and lined smelled really good. Nice little view. The place on google maps lead you somewhere else but there is a road that isn‚Äôt on maps yet where you can use a motorbike or car.

The place is on the East coast of Nusa Penida so you won‚Äôt be able to see the sunset but you can see the sunrise. A little far from main attractions but good for those looking to explore the less touristic areas. Easy with motorbike.

There is good breakfast, although no big options for dinner."

I loved my stay at You and We House. Made is so kind and funny, really made my day since arrival. The place is located far from the crowds which can be disadvantage if you don‚Äôt drive, however you can definitely rest there. Surrounded by beautiful unexplored nature, great escape from Bali to catch a breath. The rooms are clean, swimming pool with the best view. I would definitely come back, see you!","8.4
‚ÄúGreat sunrise view from the room‚Äù
Cozy wooden house with nice swimming pool and sea view. You even can see sunrise from your bed. The water in the shower is quite salty as it‚Äôs not easy to get fresh water here of being so close to the sea. They have to buy fresh water that they reserve in a big tank around the property. There are not that many attractions around the accommodation but it is a lovely place to chill out and relax as it is far away from noise. The staff are very friendly.","This is a very nice and cozy hotel, there is a beautiful and clean pool and great view. But the service is average. At first our room didn‚Äôt even have soap and shampoo. It also didn‚Äôt have hair drier. The location is soo far to main points to visit. The breakfast is soo poor and for food there are just 2 options. But the staff are so friendly and nice and all the hotel were so clean. Also the rental motors in hotel were so bad and without break.","A beautiful Hostel and a nice place to stay. The rooms are clean, the personal is polite and very friendly. We enjoy our stay here very well! We like the breakfast with view to the sea! Thank you very much! ü§ó","This is the best place to stay in Nusa Penida.
A family of 5 owns this place and everyone is so friendly and polite. They will always try their best to serve their guests. We had a stay there for almost 4 days and those were the best 4 days in Indonesia for me.
I would highly recommend this place. The rooms are very clean, classy and comfy with great room service. The view from the villas is best as you can see the infinity pool with noisy waves."

Beautiful pool. Very reasonably food prices. Very yummy NasiGoreng at 45k. Our stay was made very comfortable by CATRA. Thank you Horizon Nusa PENIDA.","Rooms are small but enough. I felt like I am at home by sharing WC and kitchen actually. It‚Äôs really honestly feeling üòä and common areas are just 5stars hotel. It‚Äôs worth more than the price we paid for sure. Stuff are so friendly and helpful .Location is also good by sea . Pool and sunrise amazing. Don‚Äôt be lazy, just wake up at 6 to watch sun rise here!!!!","Isolated kind of place, 40mins from Harbour, but it's good. Worth it .","We spent 2 night there and when we left we really felt like we were leaving our home. Everything was really perfect. The guesthouse is really well situated, everything is clean and spacious. The breakfast is amazing... you can go to the restaurant just next to the guesthouse, the cooker and the host are both working there too. The staff is just incredibly gently and friendly... we really miss this place ! If we are coming back in Nusa Penida we will definitely come again !","Beautiful, clean, modern furnished homestay. The family that owns the house is very nice and welcomes you very warmly. The breakfast is delicious and the pool is also very nice and clean."
