The first thing that impressed me was the stunning view of the volcano from the terrace.
Interior also captivated me. Cozy chairs , pleasant decor shades create a special atmosphere in this place.

As for the menu, it seemed diverse to me.
We ordered breakfast, coffee, and dessert. The food wasn't bad. But such an ordinary breakfast, costs more than in other places. Remember that here you will have to overpay for the view.

Overall, this place is a real find for lovers of beautiful views, cozy atmosphere, and delicious coffee. I recommend visiting if you are in this area.","The food is delicious but a little slow. Delicious cakes, good coffee and smoothies. The table is a bit small, not enough for ordering many dishes. The waiter provides good service and gives advice. The cafe is beautiful, clean, comfortable, and has a good view.",We came here on a cloudy day so the mountain was covered in mist so it was kind of disappointing. However you cannot deny how beautiful the view is from this cafe. The food is also good and worth trying. Servers were very kind and helpful. Highly recommend their mi goreng!,"Tbh this place is so pretty but quite crowded because of the small room with many waiter/waitress + I went there at lunch time. Besides they sell the good view, also offer the tasty food and drink. I loved how the waiter and waitress really get attention to our request.

The minus only the flies everywhere, the candle on the table really useless.

The fresh air outside really made this place didn‚Äôt need an air conditioner.
The bathroom is clean and fragrant.","Its one of many cafes which is having a beautiful scenary of mount batur in kintamani..we can do selfie with mount batur as the background..we order fried banana with sesame and surprisingly its delicious..but to bad for our drink which are coffee (its not processing in the coffee machine,it just manually brewed) and hot tea which is not hot at all"

These are great hosts with big and pure hearts!
Clean, comfortable room, with an amazing view! Comfortable bed, lots of pillows, snow-white linen - it‚Äôs so cute and cozy!
And this delicious breakfast is a compliment from the hostess, I will never forget!
God bless your family and thank you very much for your hospitality!
I definitely recommend it!","Worth the money. You can just stay in the hotel and soak up the magical views! Homemade fried banana fritters served by the amicable host to your room. Plus coffee too. Enjoy the breakfast while viewing at the majestic mountains and clouds in front of you. It was magical, almost like in heaven. The downside --- there were quite a numbers of flies, well, because the hotel is surrounded in nature. I don't mind the flies though, considering the magical view. The room is clean and tidy. Basic amenities available.","I have to find another place to stay considering the location of the cabin was too challenging for me and my sister in law to walk down.

I love the beautiful pictures presented at the booking site.   When we arrived we did not expect that we had to walk down so steep into the cabin.

It is Not a hotel like it was described at the listing  , it is a glamping site with only 2 cabins.",I loved staying here. I‚Äôve been in Bali almost a month and wanted somewhere remote to work and rest in peace and quiet. This was the perfect spot. The cabins and views are exactly like the pictures shown online and the Wi-Fi is good. I especially loved the fried bananas and coffee brought to me by the host every morning. It was a really nice touch. Would totally send friends here.,"All perfect üíØ Service and view are awesome!
We'll add just some minor details to the room, like tv and a mini fridge.
We'll come back again for sure"
