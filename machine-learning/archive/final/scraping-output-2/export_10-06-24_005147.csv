Taste of the meat is so so, i love the ambience that overview the rice field. If i would coming back again, i will probably order the pork skin only. Overall good place, thank you","The babi skin is nice, the rest are average. View is great. Our food were served quickly, but after seeing the reviews I think that our food was served quick because it was quite sepi when we dined in. There are a lot of things that the restaurant can improve like the liver (it was very tough), the quality of the food, and the service (it seems that from other reviews of this restaurant the service is quite slow so I guess they could improve on that). Overall the babi skin here is the highlight of the restaurant and the rest are average. Hope this restaurant can improve.","I come at 09.30am today, and order hot orange juice, ice orange juice and Babi Guling. The view is good, clean place, but sorry we do not get tissue in the table.

About babi guling, the skin is very crispy, i order additional skin crispy haha.. so yummy!!",Babi guling to its perfection! It was my first time; not my cup of tea but the pork skin was really crispy coupled together with sambal spices and rice.

Especially sauté! We ordered jn advance and enjoyed it a lot,"THEIR VEGAN TERANG BULAN IS FREAKIN AMAZING!!! I highly recommend it if you're craving for terang bulan but you're a vegan! Seriously it tastes like non-vegan anyways. Even the texture is also totally nailed it. I'm so grateful of them to make this really great. They don't even add baking soda. How cool! It's 100% plant-based, no egg no dairy. And ofc healthier without baking soda.

The owner is really kind, I got free nasi jinggo after we had a pretty long convo. And their nasi jinggo also tastes great! I'm sure I'll be back to try other menus.

It's a homemade vegan eatery with various of local cuisine and affordable price. 100% plant-based, no MSG, allium free.",WOW. You have to try the crunchy mushroom dish- It’s been hard for me to find great vegan food that actually has Balinese flavour and spice and THIS was perfect. The satay skewers are amazing too. 5 stars!,"Love the Nabati Geprek so much, the vibe is really chill! the price is moderate for restaurant. Love it, will visit here again when passing by",Perfect place to eat Balinese a la vegan. Liked the marinated soy and seaweed rice with the green orange juice
