Sukasada, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81161, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=7402539535037104033,OPERATIONAL,+62 819-1306-8984,,"restaurant, food",5,42,,"I would give more stars if I could!

This experience was incredibly rejuvenating. The lodge has a homely and warm feel! The hosts are incredibly talented and professional, thinking of all sorts of little things throughout my stay that improved it! From bringing out a throw blanket when I was reading in the evening to surprising me with gluten free crepes it was these small touches that made my stay!

I loved every single mouthful of the delicious meals and desserts. The massage I ordered was high quality! My room was relaxing and had everything I needed!

Truly deserves these 5 stars and I can see why other gave them too!

The gardens and grounds as well as the interior of the shared spaces are so creatively designed, colourful and fun! What a lovely change from the busyness and the black/white/beige only designs in Pererenan 😎😊😂!","This place is a gem! Got there accidentally after a golf at Handara, and it was love from the first sight!
The view and the vibe of the place is incredible, I was ready to move there from Canggu straight away. Every detail of the place is super cozy and well maintained. Owners are sweethearts, but food! Food is something you can’t find even at the fanciest restaurants of South bali.
Didn’t have the opportunity to stay overnight, but def will, as it’s a jacuzzi overlooking the lake at one of the room.
Highly recommend !!!","Lovely place and host , located on top of the hill facing the lake. The house is fully furnish and all equipped with all you need.

Stephanie, Ludo and their daughter Manon cook fantastic meal and desert at very reasonable price.

Highly recommended, will definitely come back","Our stay at Ludo and Stephanie's Airbnb was amazing! We initially booked for 1 day but ended up extending it for 2.

Ludo and Stephanie, along with their daughter, their staff, made us feel right at home. Ludo's stories and travel tips were a highlight, and it's exactly what you want from an Airbnb experience. Stephanie’s cooking was incredible — I always looked forward to breakfast!

The rooms were always clean and smelled lovely. The lodge had this European feel with a touch of Balinese culture outside – it was a unique experience. The weather was just right, cold outside but cozy inside. Waking up to the view of the lake was something I wish I could stay longer for.

Overall, it was a fantastic stay – can't recommend it enough! 5 stars all the way! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟","We were so happy with our stay! Stephanie, Ludo, and their daughter were more than accommodating and so nice to talk to. All the food was delicious!! They gave us tons of recommendations on what to do, even for our next destination. It was a great area for getting away from the busyness of other parts of Bali. They connected us with a scooter rental that had someone come drop it off for us, and connected us to someone that gave us a private tour to swim with the dolphins in Lovina. Definitely recommend!!"
