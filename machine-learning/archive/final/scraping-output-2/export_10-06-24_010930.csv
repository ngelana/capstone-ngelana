The rooms are exceptional- beds were so comfortable and when they say private pool they mean it, this place boasts tranquility and privacy and it does not disappoint. The staff were so attentive and kind. The plants were perfectly manicured. We even saw monkeys from our private pool. The shower and sink placement outside were amazing. Beware that it is a journey to get to the resort from the harbor, so plan to come here as a retreat and don‚Äôt plan to walk to other restaurants and you can only scooter if you are pretty experienced. It‚Äôs truly a luxury retreat resort.

One recommendation I would make is to offer more options on the restaurant menu. They did offer some buffets which were a good touch.

I have celiac and I was kind of relying on the hotel restaurant to cater to gluten free options, which they did for the most part. However, there was a great deal of confusion in how the menu was labeled gluten free and I‚Äôm lucky the staff knew to advise otherwise so I wouldn‚Äôt get sick. I would expect the menu to be labeled correctly and for the food to be a little better for a five star resort. But I must say all of the staff were incredible and so so helpful.","The staff were amazing, and all the food I had was excellent. Honestly, I'm not a fan of hotels that serve buffet-style breakfast because I don't eat much, and I prefer higher-quality food. That's why I loved that this resort served better quality main meals. Additionally, each room having its own pool was a fantastic feature, so I didn't have to go to the main pool. During my stay, I was there to celebrate my birthday, and many staff members surprised me without prior notice, which made me extremely happy. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there, so if you ever have the chance to visit or stay overnight in Nusa Penida, I highly recommend staying there.",I had an amazing stay!! Everything was perfect. My wonderful guide Janta made sure my friend and I had the best day and showed us all the beautiful places on the island! Would love to come back soon.,"Place was gorgeous. What was advertised was different to the villa we got, wasn‚Äôt the view we saw advertised. But everything was great. Peaceful and quiet. Villas seems close but it‚Äôs actually very well built with tress surrounding it which makes it peaceful and private. Air con is the best. But you would need to hire scooter whilst staying there because it‚Äôs up the top of mountain and walking is a bit hard. There‚Äôs hidden places to eat and shops but if you don‚Äôt know the area you would only eat at their restaurant with not much varieties on menu but don‚Äôt get me  wrong menu is good but like I said need a scooter to get around so you don‚Äôt get stuck just eating at Villa. Other I wise I would certainly recommend this place to anyone. Everything was great. The front reception workers were so friendly and helpful. Even restaurant workers were great. I would definitely stay again but would definitely hire a scooter for my whole stay.","Had a wonderful experience at this place. Unfortunately, my wife was sick for all our time at Nusa Penida, but the hotel staff made just everything to make her stay as comfortable as possible. We were really impressed by the support that everyone gave us, and other hotel facilities were same as nice. The villas are nice and comfortable, the breakfast is also great. Definitely recommend and will return in case we visit Nusa Penida once again!"

Clean rooms, super comfortable bed. Good size and clean pool. We enjoyed a nice peaceful 2 night stay. I wish we could've stayed longer. 10min away from the harbor. Only 5min away from Amarta Penida restaurant. Mini marts 7min away. Hotel offers bike rental and taxi service.","Beautiful location, a little out of the way, but honestly so relaxing and quiet.
AC works great. Only thing we didn‚Äôt love was the pillows being rock solid (I‚Äôm a soft pillow girl). The road here is pretty rough, but still accessible. The pool is beautiful and staff are lovely & welcoming & give good recommendations!","We had great days there ! Calm place and personal here for you if you need anything, I recommend 100% !","Beautiful rooms, nice pool and calm area!","We had a pleasent stay during low season. With low season discount via Booking it was a very good offer. Nice pool, nice Cottage, friendly staff.
Road or better gravel road is to the cottage is very challenging with the scooter."

Very clean and spacious rooms. There are only a few bungalows so it was very quiet and calm. Alan is the best host and made me feel at home. Staying in this cottage and discovering Nusa Penida was definitely the highlight of my Bali trip.,"Nice place with four detached rooms with double bed, bedside tables and lamps, dresser, and semi-outdoor bathroom area. Clean with a nice clean pool and breakfast service. Staff are very friendly. Is located in the middle of nowhere so needs an expensive taxi or car hire to reach, not much around it, so if you like secluded that's good but if you're a tourist it's hard to reach. I don't mind house geckos but there are a lot here and they poop on the floor a lot which is annoying. Found three scorpions in the room which was very cool but I'd rather they were outside üòÇ Also found a brahminy blind snake in the room which was awesome! Don't know how he got in through, so put him outside in the flowerbed.","Stayed here oktober 2023. Allan was a great host and helped our group out with everything. Scooterrental, ride back to the harbour, local tips etc.
We had 3 out of the 4 houses, and everything in all houses where great. Clean, big, good airco, good matrass and safe.
Can only recommand!","Rooms are amazingly spacious, very cool with the AC and the bathroom is huge. Shower is good. They help with a taxi from the port also. Laundry and motorbike rental is offered here (we used both and were pleased with what we received). The pool is very clean and is just generally nice. This place is a bit out of the way from things and the initial road to get here is very dodgy, if you are not confident on a bike then this place probably is not for you. However, the staff are so helpful and friendly and the place is just amazing.","This place has our heart. We stayed at some beautiful properties on our trip to Bali but this small cottage has our heart. The cottage is smal, precise and has everything you need on this wonderful island. Allan was amazing, very helpful, very hospitable and always keen to help. I would totally recommend this place."

Food was delicious, atmosphere and view is beautiful, service is on point. Better than 95% of the restaurants in my homeland Switzerland.
We had appetizers, drinks, main dishes, dessert and coffee/tea","This was the main restaurant that we ate in. They had a three different buffets the week we were there and we enjoyed them all. The breakfast was my favorite meal there. The detox smoothie bowl was amazing and so was the French toast.
We did lunch in our room one day and that was great as well.
The staff is absolutely the BEST service ever. They are always on top of everything and remember what you like when you have been there couple days. Excellent service.","Great place for breakfast, we haven‚Äôt stayed here but have found ourselves back for breakfast each morning. Stunning views and great staff:) would recommend.","The place is lovely, the staff is really friendly and caring. The manager also took time to welcome us and talk a little bit with us. The food was really good and for great prices. We would think since it‚Äôs a 5 stars hotel that the restaurant would be more on the high end but it‚Äôs really affordable! Thanks for having us‚ò∫Ô∏è","Amazing Restaurant, Management and chef‚Äôs Adli is wonderful

The view is incredible

Scooter is highly recommended just take care on the last few roads which are dirt & a little bumpy. Nice views across the banana plantations.

Great value for money & nice location close to Crystal Bay, plenty of food options within a 5-10 min scooter ride üõµ","Perfect stay üëå helpful and friendly host, clean room, good air-conditioned, good bed, awesome view. Early breakfast before snorkeling tour was no problem. The nearest beach is minutes away on a scooter. The host can tell you where to go. Definitely check the beach out, it's awesome.","We stayed here for 3 nights and the bungalows are very nice. Everything was clean, and the view was beautiful. The owner was very welcoming and helped whenever we had questions. The only downside is that there is not much around, and you need a scooter, car, or taxi.","As an really experienced traveler who has stayed at +200 places I can say: Best place in Nusa Penida for a great price. Besides the price, something which is priceless is the host - Wayan is such a helpful and nice person. Beautiful oceanview & super quiet location. So welcoming and kind!
