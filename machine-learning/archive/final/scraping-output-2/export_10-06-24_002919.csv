Tampaksiring, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80552, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=832657813025100541,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 8493080,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.5,294,,"First Impressions of Hoshinoya Bali

This was my first stay at a Hoshinoya property, and I chose Hoshinoya Bali for its location in Ubud. The resort is undeniably well-managed, and for those seeking a luxurious pool villa experience amidst the Ubud forest, it could be perfect.

A Note on Ambiance:

While I yearned for a more immersive forest view directly from my room, the lush greenery is truly evident in the dining and spa areas. This creates a tranquil environment, perhaps more suited for families with children who might not necessarily require a constant visual connection to nature.

Forest Lovers Take Note:

If a constant visual connection to the forest is a top priority for your stay, you might want to explore other Ubud hotels. You can see the forest only in dining or spa areas.

Breakfast and Service:

The breakfast selection, while good, wasn't particularly impressive. I cannot say the food was delicious. However, the staff were absolutely delightful - friendly, kind, and attentive.","I'm not recommended for walk in tourist to go there, you shall booking first because their exclusive hotel system. I just visit as my hotelier friend is recommended to me, but unfortunately hotel room is full. Thanks for front office staff that didn't come outside to security office, just to say hello to me in person as guest. Good level hospitality services you have. Probably they don't have lobby / front office building to let walk in guest to come in.","This resort is amazing! The design is absolutely beautiful. The food, both Japanese and Balinese, were our favorite meals of the whole trip. We highly recommend the Ayam Batutu. The gazebos overhanging the jungle valleys are an incredible way to watch the sunrise. The whole place is just gorgeous, and the staff do a great job making your stay a special experience. We stayed for two nights on a longer anniversary trip. We highly recommend!","Good and nice hotel.  However, are there any resort in Bali not be described by this two super generic words? Hoshinoya has all the good things a resort supposed to have: warm smile, super service attitude, good food and nice villa.  If I am paying for a lesser hotel chain I would be chilled, but for a $500+/night hotel I think it is fair to expect more.  The resort is a bit “homemade” and as someone who profession is closely related to cost control I couldn’t help but to think….”what a good business!”.  The location is, no offense, in the middle of nowhere (which is true that it offer some peace of mind) that I wonder how much they rent/buy from the local government.  The only road to the hotel is badly managed.  The site of the resort is really small and limited compare to most of the resort I stayed.  Security could be a concern for some people.  You cannot actually lock the main entrance of your villa, and the shared swimming pool could be accessed by other guests.

Of course there is good things about the hotel.  First the food is good.  Japanese sashimi is recommended as they are in good quality.  They also offer sufftles bus to the town center of nearby small town (Ubud) where you can do some sightseeing (not easy for smaller kids but there is supermarket and other place for dinning). Special credit to the driver who manage to solve a little problem by his smart.  The “birdcage” there are quite interesting to seat in and enjoy the view of the forest.  Just don’t expect that is a primitive jungle.

I would still recommend this place if they are not as expensive.  For me they are a bit overpriced.  For same money you can have more option in Bali and anywhere else in the world.",Its not your usual Hoshinoya in Japan - its definitely more run down and the rooms are showing their age and things aren't working reflecting poor management and housekeeping. There are better and newer properties in Bali so perhaps one to avoid.

Komang is so talented at what she does, and incredibly skilled at passing on her knowledge, the class was taught in English and we found it to be so informative and thorough, we started from the start and learnt all the steps for weaving. Overall would highly recommend visiting Komang for a class on the weekend to learn more about this art, and to connect which such a wonderful woman and her family - book a few days ahead to make sure you aren't disappointed, and I would definitely recommend a longer session if you have the time! Communication is super easy over WhatsApp and very fast. So glad we attended, it was truly a highlight of our time in Bali and it was such a special memory for my mother and I. I can't wait to visit again","Wonderful morning of backstrap weaving taught in English. Bali tradition, passed down from Grandmother to daughter/granddaughter.
