Great view of the ocean. But I hope they can upgrade the restrooms, it's rather gross with a shared gutter to pee instead of a real toilet in each cubicle. And we are expected to pay too! Sheesh!","Only 'big' restaurant around this area. Ample of seatings available. Came for dinner and we are the only customer around at that point. However the service is extremely slow. We waited for more than an hour for the food.
Seafood is very average. Only the satay is quite decent. Many parking's available.","We go there often. Reasons being : the food is always fresh and varied for a very reasonable price and we have never had any problems with quality. Also the staff are very welcoming and helpful. This place is excellent for a snack stop, or for a nice relaxing lunch or dinner. Well done to the very intuitive manager, the friendly staff and the talented chefs.","Beautiful views, wonderful service, & delicious food! This is great place to stop for a meal or just enjoy a cup of coffee & the views! They are open 24 hours. During the day there are stunning views of the ocean. They have a large menu that includes local seafood, traditional Indonesian food as well as some Western choices.","nice restaurant
