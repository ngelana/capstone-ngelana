This place is so relaxing, tranquil yet has an effortlessly cool vibe. Love it all! The staff are the friendliest and make your stay perfect. Owner is clearly very involved and introduced himself which was so great to see. Perfect place for sunsets swims and cocktails by the infinity pool, in the heart of Ulu. Massages and food are also great. Can‚Äôt wait to return!","It‚Äôs our first stay in Bali island and we booked for 3 night, we felt more than satisfying there!
The hotel is very beautiful itself, especially the view is spectacularly stunning, perfect for the Sunset if you don‚Äôt wanna go out ,there are 3 pools you can totally enjoy!
Amazing hospitality, very friendly staff ,they can literally offer anything you need .

Highly recommend!","The best hotel I have ever been to! The location and style of the hotel is amazing, and so relaxing. But the best part are the staff, they are so friendly and helpful, really exceptional service. We can‚Äôt wait to come back for a third time üíñüíõ","I, Buffy Chen, checked in on April 14th and checked out on April 15th. I stayed in the [passion suite] suite of Gravity Boutique Hotel. I checked in on April 14th and went to the sister building next to me in the afternoon to take pictures. After taking pictures for a while, a boy suddenly came over. Asked where we lived, we went back to the building next door, but we came to take pictures, and then he left, and then a short and fat girl came over. Later we found out that her name was [intan] and asked us again, and we were told that we lived in the building next door. , (the same group and I believe the same boss)
I was afraid that she would think we were trespassing and came in to take pictures, so I explained again and showed her our room card.
Then she said that we couldn't take pictures with the camera. Her attitude felt like she was looking for trouble. If she couldn't take pictures with the camera, why didn't she tell us when she checked in? What's more, she stopped us after taking pictures for a while. We couldn't understand why we couldn't take pictures with the camera. That day There was no one in the swimming pool and no other tourists at all when the photo was taken, but she stopped her forcefully and we had no choice but to cooperate and leave.

When I returned to the main building of the accommodation, I asked the receptionist (same position) who was also at the counter. She said that it was definitely possible to take pictures with a camera. She also contacted our tour guide and asked her to ask the manager of the hotel if it could be used. Regarding the rule of taking photos with the camera, the supervisor replied that it was okay that night, as long as it did not interfere with other people or commercial photography (such as wedding photography), it would be fine. The tour guide also told Ning that if she meets that [intan] again tomorrow, she can give her the supervisor's reply. Look (with pictures)

What I want to say here is that we are in the same group, and no one cares about the building we live in no matter how I use the camera to take pictures. If it is a company regulation, then both buildings should follow the same rules, and there are so many waiters in the hotel and no one stops me. The one [intan] has an opinion about is obviously her personal opinion.

Later, when we had breakfast the next day, we met again. This time, she was the one at the counter of the building where we stayed, but I didn‚Äôt take it seriously. I thought she had been informed that she would not stop me from taking photos, but I was wrong!
As soon as my husband picked up the camera, she immediately ran over and stopped us again in a serious and serious manner (it showed that she had been paying attention to me) and once again strongly emphasized that we could not take pictures with the camera. It was really baffling! ! !
An Internet beauty hotel repeatedly stopped people from taking photos, let alone a hotel that cost a lot of money.

Then I sent the guide to my supervisor and showed her reply. She still had a tough attitude and refused to take pictures of me. I really had to suspect that she was targeting Asians. I had to doubt this because she was later photographed with Europeans and Americans. They were talking, laughing, and had a warm attitude, which was completely different from their attitude towards us! (As shown in the picture)
We couldn't communicate rationally with her, and I was so angry that I said I wanted to file a complaint against her. I took a photo of her name tag, but she hurriedly covered it with her hands (pictured)
It‚Äôs really weird!
If being magnanimous is strictly in compliance with the company's regulations, she can stand her ground, so why should she be afraid of me taking pictures of her name tag? But it's no use hiding it, I've already seen her name

This ridiculous woman completely messed up my mood for the past two days. I was so angry that I couldn't eat breakfast that day.

I love Bali so much, and the people in Bali are all kind and polite, but this woman is really a spoiled rat!","We loved our time here at Gravity and can‚Äôt wait to come back! We stayed in the Raja suite that was stunning/spacious and had the most beautiful view. The vibe was relaxing and easy, it felt like you were in your own gorgeous home. The pool is stunning ü§© Everyone from the lovely girls on reception, to the boys at the bar (Ari, Alit) and Jey!! were so fantastic, kind and helpful. Would highly recommend!"

Beautiful pool, clean rooms, and a fantastic eatery by the pool with great coffee, juices, smoothies, mockails, and a plethora of vegan and vegetarian dishes. Everything about our experience at Le Bamboo was priceless. Truly the lap of luxury in Uluwatu!!",Gorgeous place!! The bungalows are unreal. Staff are helpful and friendly. Incredibly clean. Lovely pool area. Very quiet but in a good location.,"Amazing hotel: quiete lodges blent into nature, huge infinity pool overlooking the ocean (probably the best place for sunset) and great food, all of it catered by the nicest staff",wonderful place. great view. an amazing experience. we felt close to nature. the restaurant has very tasty vegan food.,"It looks amazing on the pictures, and disappointing when you are there. we book 3 bedroom villa for a week. The pool looks great until my son feel ill on the first night. he vomited and fever. couldnt eat for 2 days and stayed in bed. My husband complained, and they finally cleaned the pool on the 4th day. There is construction, right a cross the villa, very noisy and dusty. Absolutely very annoying as they charged for higher $1400 aud for 6 days, bloody expensive. Definitely we wont recommend this villa. Noone has been in the pool since day 1."

We were welcomed by the most amazing staff who made you feel like family! The hotel itself is stunning. Grounds & rooms are VERY well kept & clean as well. We had breakfast at the hotel both mornings & the food was delicious! They communicated through WhatsApp prior to our arrival & helped us set up a pick up from the airport as well as a scooter rental & recommendations for restaurants & beaches in the area. 100% recommend this hotel for your stay in Uluwatu!,"This place was an absolute hidden gem! The staff were so welcoming, friendly and helpful, the accommodation was clean and the views were beautiful üòç.

The (free!) breakfast here surpassed all our expectations and I would wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to say it was the best breakfast of our three week trip to Bali (the pictures we took did not do it justice - we were too excited to get tucked in!). It was actually restaurant quality and I would pay to eat here if I wasn‚Äôt staying at the resort!

All in all, 10/10 for us.","Fantastic Friendly staff, in a secluded location, however, by no means far from the beach or night life. Brilliant motorbike or scooter rider away from everything.","We stayed the first three days there to get used to the Bali weather and chill after the long flight.
The people were super nice, everything was great and clean. Pool was super nice to chill in. Overall 10/10 perfect location in Bali.","The perfect romantic gateway. We had such an amazing time there. Each villa comes with a comfy bedroom, privater terrace with pool and also an open air bathroom. If you find a large gecko in your room they can catch it in a friendly way and takes out of the room. If you stay there choose a romantic floating breakfast as well."

Here you feel loved and helped to have a sweet holiday.
Peace and positive vibes. Amazing view from the swimming pool to the mountain and ocean; where you swim waiting for your breakfast /or dinner","We were given an upgrade to gravity villas from le bamboo due to a faulty air-con in our room (which was excellent otherwise) and they made us feel like royalty. From our arrival at Le bamboo, the whole check in experience was seamless and friendly and the resort itself (all villas) was clean, green and reminiscent of the Greek islands. As always, the friendliness of the Balinese people shines and the staff here are no exception. We only identified the issue with the air con after returning from dinner and if it was an inconvenience for them, you would not have known it. They seemed only too happy to accommodate us, and the new room was akin to being in the penthouse! It was enormous, with great views and excellent amenities. We slept very well. And breakfast (all included) the next morning was as good as you'll get anywhere. A bit off the beaten track, (5 min gojec into Uluwatu) this is a peaceful retreat away from it all. ....thank you for having us","Highly recommend Gravity Suites to anyone seeking a memorable stay in Bali. It truly offers an unforgettable experience with its stunning views, comfortable accommodations, and outstanding service. I cannot wait to return for another amazing"

We booked the largest villa on site with private pool, etc. which advised it slept 6 people with 2 sofa beds. Please dont book and bring 6 people as the sofa beds don't exist and it only sleeps 4. The staff did not try and help the situation and shrugged. It was very dirty and falling apart, but a massive and lovely villa. We tried to have a few friends over one afternoon, for drinks and the lady running the place would not let them into the villa. Said they were not allowed unless they were staying with us. I thought this was ridiculous and our friends had travelled 20 mins to come hang out and were not even allowed up our stairs. Each time we would leave the villa the staff would come in and pull out the plugs to the refrigerators which had food and drinks in there, this happened each day we stayed. Its really sad because the place was quiet and had a lot of potential but our stay was really tinted by the attitude of the staff and misleading listing of the villa itself.","Is a cool place, we stay in the garden view room, I love the outdoor bathroom but is very small. The view in the morning is very contemplative. If you want to see the sunrise you need to go up to the yoga Shala or to the Pool.
The room have humidity so they need to be open for let the air go trough it. They‚Äôre some mosquitos but not so much.
We stay there still in pandemic situation, we was the only ones in the rooms, it doesn‚Äôt look that they give so much manteinance but is also comprensible because they don‚Äôt have so much people. If you will book there, confirmed that your room is good manteinance and do it days before.",The place is good enough although a bit overpriced for the quality of the rooms but the very strategic location makes up for it. The pool was nice. The place lacked a bit of Bali touch in my opinion. The scooter rental was expensive compared to the other places we stayed at.,"Wa had a reservation at this hotel, but at the end  we didn't stay at the hotel, the service was really bad,  because we waited an hour before someone came to welcome us. The hotel was really dirty, the pool was a shame. The hotel looks completely abandoned ... It was really CREEPY !","One of the worst hotels in Bali. Really bad attitude from all the staff, dirty rooms and deplorable bathroom. Nice views but totally NOT worth it. The receptionist was very rude, the staff did not help us with the luggage even when asked to. To sum up, there are much better options in Bali and not recomendable at all."

There is dinner served every night besides Saturday, which brings everyone together and helps to get to know the other guest here. Food is great and portions generous. The surf lessons have been fun with great instructors. I really appreciate the honesty system for drinks, you take drinks out of the fridge and put them on a list to be charged at the end of your stay. The whole property is very well looked after and clean and all the staff members are lovely! The new pool is awesome! Only downside is that prices for drinks and the local drivers are a bit too expensive compared to going prices in the area. Also the scooters they rent out aren't in great shape and always come with an empty fuel tank. Overall I definitely recommend staying here and had such a great time!","I spent one week here and had the best time! The staff is really lovely, everybody is friendly and helpful. You normally have breakfast and dinner together with the other guests (if you wish) which gives the whole camp this Kamafari family feeling ‚ù§

Getting vegetarian meals at the camp is not a problem, even vegan is mostly feasible. There's also plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants close by that you reach best with a scooter (can be rented at the camp, about 3‚Ç¨/day).

I had never surfed before and took only 3 lessons but thanks to the instructors and the good conditions for beginners I stood on the board on day one and was able to catch some waves. Even though I'm not the sportiest it was really fun!

We stayed at one of the Ocean View Rooms with AC and a separate bathroom. All was very clean and tidy and in good condition.

Thanks for the great holiday, I'll definitely come back! üåä","My boyfriend and I had a really nice 4 day stay at Kamafari surf camp. The surf instructors are super friendly, expert and patient. We were both beginners but we managed to improve and catch some waves in a very short period of time. Also the staff at the camp was very helpful and the food included in the price was basic but good. We really had a very good time!! Totally recommended.","Not exactly like the website... However, if you are in the market of Surf Camps in Bali you will not be disappointed. The rooms are nice and comfortable... the shared bathroom is a nice touch. The food is good and worth the price. The staff is great... on on levels of the operation. The surf instructors are the highlight of the whole experience you will improve working with them. If you pass on Kamafari you will have decided to pass on a great ride... Surf‚Äôs UP!","What an epic experience! It's the vibe and the atmosphere, inclusive of being able to relax and have your own space with a stunning view of the trees and ocean in front of the social/ eating area and bedrooms. Everything is available from beginner to intermediate surfboards (for the more experienced surfers take your pick of surfboards closely located at shops nearby), scooters and quality food. Will hope to be back as soon as possible! Thank you guys and girls for your kind and friendly attitude including your secret and informative tips with regards to surf spots and places to go."
