I spent time here around 2 hours till the restaurant closed. Love the cakes, the carrot and the burnt cheesecake. The potato wedges are 10/10. The pizza was 7/10.

The Sandwich is amazing, cooked to my liking, the sauce between the bread is also delicious! Be the lime strawberry tea taste decent too and the lemon peach tea taste... Almost chemically? I don't know how to describe it, it taste like weird combination or it's the peach that taste REALLY weird and super sour?
The service is good but I don't know how to effectively call any help/waitress, and i spent like 15minutes to attract any attention to my table because i sat quite far from the bar. I just don't want to shout to the waitress while others are enjoying their time :(  Maybe call button will be a good solution. there are outdoor area you can explore but because it was too humid, we need ac, so we sit inside.

1. Initially we called for a reservation for 2 persons, and it was immediately rejected and we were asked to come directly. We explained that we had been there last week ago and did not get a table on the 2nd floor (because my husband smokes), they said please come and they guaranteed that we would definitely get a place. As a result, when we arrived at the restaurant, we almost didn't get the table we wanted on the 2nd floor, fortunately there were customers who finished eating and left immediately, so we occupied their table.
2. We ordered Cesare salad, prawn n avocado salad, chicken stripes & chips as a starters, then chicken cordon bleu and chicken parmigiana as main courses, as well as renon sunset, banana & strawberry shake, and mineral water for our drinks.
We asked for the Cesare salad, prawn n avocado salad, chicken chips and the whole drinks to be brought out first. The main course chicken cordon bleu and chicken parmigiana were brought out after we finished eating the starters menu. But what happened... they brought out all the menus simultaneously and made our table full of food like there was going to be a festival.
Honestly, it was embarrassing! It looks like we hadn't eaten in weeks.
It's a good thing we ordered our dessert and coffee last, otherwise it's unimaginable.

FOOD :
The food should to be good, but .. Our food, especially for the main course (chicken cordon bleu and chicken parmigiana) got cold and very inedible as the flour became hard and too tenacious to eat.
Fortunately, the saut√©ed vegetables and mash potato were still good to eat even when cold.

Last but not least..
1. Teach your staff to never underestimate a reservation request even if it's for 2 persons!
2. Teach your waiter/s how to handle customer requests, if a customer request is not understandable, teach them TO ENQUIRE AGAIN AND DON'T MAKE PERSONAL ASSUMPTIONS.

Perhaps we were wrong in thinking that the staff at White Canny were just like at any other similar restaurant we've been to, able to understand and comprehend what we were being instructed. Looks like our expectations were too high. Honestly, we were completely flabbergasted when the waitress pulled out all our orders, and since we were too lazy to comment anymore, we let it go and made a note for ourselves.

One of the fantastic things about White Canny is that the ambience of the restaurant is hommy and charming, with a little touch of European restaurant atmosphere.
The service was also good and friendly, but unfortunately they couldn't execute the customer's instructions better and never underestimate a reservation request even only for 2 person!","The staff is very friendly and attentive, they always make sure that we are comfortable and have everything we need. All the foods are very great and tasty.. also the cafe has a comfortable seating area, perfect for enjoying a quiet moment or catching up with family.","Here for team dinner,we made reservation.

That said, service could be more attentive at times and it feels as though portions are slowly shrinking with inflation.
The food is all very tasty but we have found that occasionally some dishes are better spicy, even for locals like us. Perhaps customers could be asked if they prefer spicy or not because many people won‚Äôt expect a grilled chicken banh mi to have raw chili inside.

Recommended place.","All food not fresh, i gave to my dog that come with us. he also dont eat it! and what was worse was, i hv to asked for payment to be edited and only 10% off from all food we almost dont eat !","Visited for lunch at this open-air spot in Bali, but the experience left much to be desired. Despite the pleasant atmosphere, the price doesn't align with the portion size. The dishes were disappointingly lackluster, particularly the grilled prawn and clams, which lacked flavor compared to Jimbaran. The only highlight was the sauteed water spinach.

To top it off, I discovered a fly in my tofu, completely ruining my appetite. While the manager offered apologies and a complimentary fruit platter, it doesn't make up for the hygiene lapse. Removing the fried tofu and tempeh from the bill felt like a necessity rather than a goodwill gesture.

In conclusion, I strongly advise against this place. The cost doesn't justify the portions, and the taste falls short of expectations. Hygiene concerns further mar the overall dining experience.",Very refreshing non alcoholic drinks we got and were so good. Good selection of traditional food aswell. We had a good time here

Paid around 330K for two people.",It's been a while not coming to BrownFox but this cafe is very consistent. They make really good waffle. They expanding with now Bruno. I haven't try Bruno but it seems legit. I recommend brownfox for their waffle. Keep it up the good service and products.,"Great place for your waffle fix! Went there for lunch with my family, we ordered Crispy Fish Pesto Pasta, BBQ Chicken Baked Rice and Maple Butter Waffle for dessert. We were completely satisfied with all of it! This place is famous for its waffles and pancakes but they also have quite an extensive food menu, and the meals we had were delicious too! I especially loved the pesto pasta and of course the waffle. The waffle was deliciously crispy outside and soft inside, and boy, it was big! Really worth the price! The place is nice and spacious too. Highly recommended!","Affordable price, good taste, and good service. Seats are pretty cozy, most of them, not all.

Not so extensive menu, but apparently now they do sell pizza. Quite a comfort food, the pasta os basically my go-to meal here. I've tried their waffle but didn't suit my palate, I find other place offers better waffle. WiFi is alright.
Car parking is limited.
Payment using credit and debit card, QR, and cash
Overall, a good dining experience.

PS: toilet can be dirty at times.","Most reccomended menu is the Waffle. I think if you're visiting here for the first time. I would recommend the Waffle. If you don't want too sweet, I will reccomend a chocolate waffle. Because salted caramel is a bit sweet for me. For nasi goreng, I think the tomato sauce is a bit too much. But maybe it's just a preference. And I think the rice was too wet. It seems it is the same rice for baked rice. It's different from the usual nasi goreng. The lychee tea was great."

Now there's more menus to choose! By opening at 7 am in the morning really helps to get comfort food early in the morning. My favorite always Kaya Toast Butter, Kopi C & Lo Ma Gai. Other foods also good here. The tea is what I'm aiming for my next visit. The music also enough to fill the room not too loud.",Nasi goreng hongkong was SOOOO GOOOODDD!!  i asked them to make it spicy. And definitely will be my favorite menu.,"A decent kopitiam place, drinks were really okay not bad but not good. The coffee milk tea was honestly could be better but i only taste the watery coffee for some reason.

Dimsum was okay, toast was okay.
I'm really not that impressed by this place it just feels okay and decent or should i say ""meh"" is the right word.

Service was great. Lots of menu sold out too, ac wasn't cold enough.

Kinda disappointed since i have high hopes for this place."

When we came here first time, we love their Rustica Pizza. The second time we came, we didn't eat their pizza but eat only pasta.

I recommended you to go at least once and try their food. Very friendly staff, it is a five star for me üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü","My only complaint is I wish the chicken caesar salad had a ranch dressing. They give you thousand island dressing for a caesar salad üò≠

Pizza is very good for Bali. But do not order it for takeaway on Grab, because by the time it arrives, it‚Äôs cold and soft and doesn‚Äôt taste good. I ordered the same pizza for dining in, and it was very good pizza, hot and crispy out of the oven. I will come back again.

One bite. Everyone knows the rules.","So far the best pasta I've ever eaten. The pasta is al dente with perfectly balance seasoning, creamy and sauce. Super delicious! Credit the chef !

Definitely will come back again and again to try other dish to satisfy my Italian cuisine.

The staff also very friendly and the services are excellent.

The price is quite affordable  compare to the quality of the food you get with generous portion

Adding this place to my favorite Italian restaurant in Bali!!","We've been to Mamma Mia Ubud before, so it's not our first Mamma Mia experience. This time we ordered pizza and spaghetti carbonara. Overall the taste is good, although I wish the Carbonara could be more rich with cream. But that's just personal preference.
Service are friendly and nice.

So if you are around at Renon and looking for a good Italian food, you can try it."

The biryani is well-seasoned made with whole spices and long grain rice. I had the salmon and the chicken leg, both held up well after 30 minutes on the scooter. Ate both boxes for lunch which was too much but very satisfying.

It‚Äôs a spartan room with about 6-8 tables and cashless payment only. Service was friendly but it looks like they do more takeaway since tables weren‚Äôt cleared quickly.

But the food taste is broken just like the name, everything is very sweet especially ""carbo topokki"".

For drinks, we ordered mango ade and strawberry ade. Both are delicious but unfortunately the portions are small.

The decor is inviting and the staff friendly. However, one notable issue was the frequent unavailability of items on the menu, which can be disappointing for customers. I'd suggest they work on improving their menu availability to ensure a more satisfying experience for visitors. Implementing a limited menu during peak hours could be a great solution to streamline operations and enhance customer satisfaction. Despite this, the cafe does have potential and I'd definitely return if the menu situation improves.","Selesa Backyard is a nice place with a cozy ambiance, perfect for getting some work done. The food is affordable, and I especially love their French fries. Coffee is also in a good price, but the taste is not really for me.
I do wish they would vary the music selection more, as it's predominantly Indonesian songs. Personally, I find it a bit challenging to concentrate and be productive when most of the staff are playing with their phones at a loud volume.

It would be great if they could use earphones/lower their phone's sound to create a more comfortable atmosphere for guests.","I ordered BBQ chicken steak, but the chicken didn't have any taste, I also ordered the Snack bucket and it was delicious, I liked the fries, my friend ordered Black pepper beef rice but according to my friend the tasted it feels very ordinary, nothing special or even lacking. And for sweet iced tea, it tastes very bland","Selesa Backyard looked as beautiful inside as it did on the outside. It was relatively quiet with several small tables away from each other so it was simply implausible to feel cramped. There was also a backyard (as the name suggested) with two swings children can play on. It was a semi outdoor restaurant so no AC, but it was breezy inside so the heat wasn‚Äôt a problem. The Gurame was nice but the chicken wings were the blandest wings I have ever tasted. I opted for the Original Flavour (they also had BBQ chicken wings) but I expected it to taste more than bland flour.

Pretty place, meh food. Wouldn‚Äôt revisit.","One of these new, clean, stylish cafes well managed by youngsters of the last generation (barely 20 plus). Nice backyard for families with small children, good for selfies and other idiotic Instagram stuff. The food is modern but simple more like an addition. The coffee is excellent and the waiter/owner girls are happy and helpful. I come again!"
