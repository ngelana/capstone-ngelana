The room/ loft I’ve originally booked wasn’t living up my expectations so I asked to change and they did! The room was nice and as well as the huge bed. KTS Hotel is set in the middle of a jungle so if you are not a fan of animals and nature in general, it’s not a place for you.
There were 2 big pools, great number of facilities and lovely staff!

The rooms could use some more cleaning tho!","Our stay at Katak Tepi Sawah Resort in Canggu was a fantastic experience. The resort is tucked away beneath a busy street. Being shielded from the busy street gives the impression that this is a secluded spot in the midst of nature. Everywhere you look you find a lot of detail, true bali style. This resort is truly a paradise!

https://youtu.be/tLvWPxGD1sQ?si=LLUvzC57B-IXrAx8

The hospitality is exceptionally good. We were welcomed with a smile, a cold towel and a welcome drink. The hostesses, Mira and Tina, are kind and professional. Both speak good English and are incredibly helpful. The room attendant (we don’t know his name) is very friendly and takes cleaning very seriously! The rooms were thoroughly cleaned by him every day.

The food is of an exceptionally high standard. The chef is an incredibly friendly man with tremendous talent for Balinese cuisine. It’s hard to find better gado-gado or nasi-goreng. We also loved the breakfast. The chef also conducts a cooking class. Don’t miss it! It’s very educational if you’re interested in cooking Balinese dishes at home.

We had a couple of amazing massages! The staff at the spa is very professional.

The excellent service might be due to all the staff being trained by the owner himself at the TIPS hospitality school.

Finally, our villa. We stayed for four nights in ""The Edge."" It was a delightful experience because, as mentioned above, it was very clean. Additionally, there is good air conditioning and a large swimming pool in this villa. The beds are very comfortable. Everything is beautifull and there is a lot of detail. A true balinese experience. The only downside is that we coule not get the locks on the doors to work. Also, the safe was not working. However, this was not a problem for us because the entire staff is very trustworthy and we felt very safe!

Next time when we visit bali we want to stay longer!","Thankyou for everyone at KTS,
Driver , Mirah and Hanii. Super friendly and accomidating. Only had the opportunity to stay here 1 night. Beautiful jungle vibes and nature. I stayed in the loft . If you love a gree house this is the room for you.

Thankyou ill be back 😘😘","Cosy place with friendly staff, good yoga classes. The frog theme is awesome. They provide transportation to the city, it's worth the drive for a calmer atmosphere at the hotel.","These villas provide an oasis of calm and serenity with beautiful views of nature while also providing services to help relax and reset. There are sounds of nature all around. Free wifi throughout the villa allows you to stay connected to the outside world and look up ways to explore more of Bali.
The vegetation surrounding and within the villas provide shade and coolness on the warm and sunny days.
There are two pools provided to guests and a whole villa that comes with its own private pool. There is a gym and steam room as well as a spa on site with a variety of packages and services. My partner and I did the Golden Package in the spa and were so relaxed that it was hard not to fall asleep during the 4 hour pamper session.
Ashtanga yoga in the morning is a great way to start the day. The beginner session gets you sweaty to warm up while slowing down and building strength and allowing your body to stretch out and become more flexible. The session is about an hour with 3 minute meditations at the beginning and end. The session may leave you feeling a bit sore in areas you may not have worked in a while. After doing this beginner class 3 days in a row, there was no soreness in the muscles even though the most I had done a yoga session up to this point was about 30 minutes.
All the food is tasty, especially the Nasi Goreng.
All the staff are friendly and polite. They take time to learn your name and will ask you about your sleep, programs you have for the day, and if they can clean your room. They make sure to look out for you. We left our keys in the door before we went on a day trip, and they made sure we knew and had a laugh about it when we returned. The staff also adds little memorable touches like setting your table before each course of your meal and putting your napkin in your lap as well as addressing you by name when they see you.
The only downside to this villa is the distance from the beach and other places to explore in Canggu. There isn't much besides little shops to buy some essentials and snacks in walking distance. The staff is happy to accommodate driving you to canggu. If you're keen to hop on a scooter or drive one this is also an option that might be quicker."

It is located in a quiet neighborhood so it's perfect for those who would like a peaceful retreat.

The villa was really spacious. Each has its own private pool, kitchen, dining room, and living room. It was very comfortable staying there and I felt so much at home. I didn't feel the need to go out that much :)

The team of staff were very helpful. They would help you prepare breakfast and even get you amenities that you need. Just kindly ask :)

Another point that made my stay super awesome was the owner, Andre. He was really kind, informative, and friendly.

Thanks for the amazing stay and experience!
Much love from Jakarta :)","The best place we had a chance to stay at in Bali.

Large tables, quiet on weekdays. Owners are very nice.

They do have dogs that will bork at you upon arrival. Just your typical Bali dogs.","The service was good but we have to say we are very disappointed in the food quality and size. Paying 15000 for one potato for example is not justified. We had Mie Goreng, Nasi Goreng, soup and dessert and were disappointed.","Was pretty concerned about the cleanliness and the dogs based on the previous reviews, but when I went, it was clean and no dogs in sight. It was completely empty though, and I thought they were closed. Got takeaway for ribs and pork sate.

Ribs 8/10 - was really good, and the prices are a bit better than most other places. Tasted a bit like American bbq ribs. Will DEF get these again

Pork sate 3/10 - flavor was ok, but it was TOUGH and CHEWY. I think the meat was really old. It was like chewing rubber. Would never get this again.

Overall will definitely order ribs here again, and probably quite often. The taste is better than most of the other ones I've had in Bali. Please do something about the pork sate, its one of the worst I've had in terms of chewiness!","The ribs that we ordered was delicious, friendly staff, but maybe don't put lot of sugar in the drink because it was too sweet.","The food there is really good rib is the best

Rooms were cleaned every day and swimming pool and Alfresco Area immaculate. We also enjoyed the fact that we had a little kitchen in every room to prepare some breakfast. I enjoyed being in a peaceful area.,"I see Esmee and Courtney have written a very bad review 4 months ago purposely to hurt someone's business and reputation.

I have Stayed at Arta Jaya multiple times over the past 5 years and it has always been clean and friendly. The owner Ketut has always looked after me and my family, his staff, the girls in the office, always greeted me with a smile and anything i asked for or needed help with was never an effort for them.

Last time I stayed there after covid I booked out every room as my mum who has cancer hadn't seen her granddaughter in a very long time due to covid would not stay anywhere else due to how comfortable and clean it is....My mother has OCD when it comes to cleanliness.

People can write bad reviews, then why would you stay there long-term, especially as I am sure you got a very good covid deal to rent out the whole place for 1 year and then stab your host in the back. Bali is a tropical island with allot of rain and humidity it would be tough to find a place without a puddle or a bit of mould that can be cleaned off. Scheming and plotting for 1 year and gather a few photos to discourage others and try and shame a proud business owner is disgraceful

Arta Jaya I have found to be the cleanest, friendliest and most well maintained guesthouses in Bali...even the swimming pool.

My advice is, if you didn't like it, stay 1 day not 1 year and take a good look at how you live...It took them weeks to clean after you left.",Mouldy and damp rooms and very noisy place because there is a the owner's warehouse/ workshop right next to the guest house. Roofs are leaking. There were worms in the pool and there are people walking around the guest house all the time even though we rented it for long term.,Be warned ! Owner is a nightmare to rent from long term. My friend stayed here for a yearly rental. The room had mould issues and she was not treated with respect and there is noise all day from owner warehouse and noise at night from the staff drinking alcohol late.
