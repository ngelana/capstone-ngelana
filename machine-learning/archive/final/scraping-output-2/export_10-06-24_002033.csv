I was the only person there, it was so peaceful!
You will first see the big statue of Brahma which is spectacular and huge!
There will be some slippery stairs to go to the waterfall which is stunning and you will also find the pool with holy water. Please dress properly to respect the culture. Women cannot go if during their period. No pay fee but donations are
welcome.","Absolute paradise.
This hidden gem lies abit remote hidden in the jungle.
Many steps going down to the waterfalls.
The waterfall is very impressive and very beautiful.
Water is nice and refreshing for a swim","Jagasatru wayetfall is small but it is a beautiful spot to linger. From the scooter parking, you walk down about 100 big steps to get to the holy pool, for which sarong etc is required (see photo). The waterfall is a few steps more, entirely separate, and has a small, knee deep pool to splash in. Entrance cost by donation. Tiny snack warung by the entrance with great view of Padang Bai shore. The people working there were welcoming. They clean up the rubbish and even have walking sticks for visitors to use, something I'venot seen anywhere else. So nice to not be hassled. The 2.5km access road is paved, except for the final hundred metres. It is in very good conditon but is steep in parts, with some tight bends - easy at slow speeds.","Nice hidden natural waterfall with healing water pool and fire good statue - Ketut’s managing so well! Hope it stays as it is and won’t be turned to a tourist trap!
Also if you are open, Ketut show you traditional cooking. Just ask him at the small warung. He is also open to drive you here, if needed on fb lagoonsdriver","If you re staying in Ahmed or near Candidasa beach, definitely worth coming here. The road is tricky and very narrow, so drive safely. But once you arrive, you will find an amazing waterfall, special place to bath with holy water, coffee with a view of the ocean and the jungle. Also good place to take unique instagram photos, not many tourists around since it is so remote. Your own private pool in the jungle basically."
