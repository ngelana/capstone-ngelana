It’s the best restaurant I’ve been to in Bali. Believe me, I’ve been to a lot of amazing places here. Everything was down to a T. Get the set menu. Every dish was superb. Bursting with flavours. The service was amazing, the girls are really welcoming and kind. To top it off, the setting was perfect. 10/10 deffinatly returning","I saw this place on a TikTok review and was skeptical about it. But after trying this place, this place is beyond and more.

The food was amazing, the service was top notch, the price was not even that expensive. The sashimis were so fresh. The scallop melts into your mouth. All of the tastes were balanced, almost like its catered to your taste buds

Honestly, one of the best experience I have while visiting Bali. Everyone should definitely visit this place at least once in their lifetime.

No bad review and I don't get how people could leave a bad review.

kudos to the chefs","I stumbled upon this hidden gem on Google, a restaurant located in a residential area. It was a bit surprising because initially, I thought it was a standalone restaurant, but it turned out to be situated in a house. The host and chef were very friendly. Despite the simplicity of the restaurant, it was comfortable and charming. Simple yet delightful.

We ordered steak, mushroom soup, and spaghetti. Everything we ordered had an authentic and delicious taste. The chef personally came to greet us, and the hospitality was remarkable. We even received a very generous bonus portion.

Moreover, the prices were very reasonable.

Overall, we were very satisfied with the food and service here. Highly recommended for those who want to try dining in a unique and unconventional setting outside a traditional restaurant.","Loved that place, felt so far from the noise and stress of the Denpasar City. Had the menu and liked it all. Came for steak but the rest was also very good. Did think they should ask up front how you would like the steak done, it came raw, which was fine with me, but the small Gass burner is not a quality solution if well done is preferred. Service was excellent and you see the Chef check and talk to each customer. Was very personal all of it. Probably you should reserve up front, I was lucky to get a Table. Did get an extra desert, but that's not my motivation to recommend this place. :-)","One of the best evenings in Bali and definitely the most delicious steak I've ever had.

You don't just get a Michelin level taste, you get a gastronomic experience. The concept of the restaurant is based on the privacy of the tables, you don't see other guests, you enjoy the evening and the owner treats you to a first class steak and other dishes ❤️ I will remember this evening for the rest of my life, thank you!"

A real bohemian style to the place.
Well equipped room with an extra day bed and a super cold fridge. Nice cold air conditioning made it very comfortable.
Helpful friendly staff.
You do need transport at this location though.
I was also a little confused about how they call themselves a bed and breakfast, but they don't serve food. You can however cook your own in the guest kitchen.
Nice little swimming pool but didn't quite look inviting enough for me to get in.","The place in general is quite good, in a good spot close to many markets and shops. If you have a bike (a must) just minutes away from the different points of interest. It also has a pool but is never clean. During the day and night it could be a little bit noisy because of the motorcycles, cars and trucks passing by. The only problem is that because is quite and old house, you will find many bugs (ants, termites, cockroaches). And one thing that needs to be cleaned urgent are the water tanks. Even though they are not for drink, the sink and shower , in the water, they come out with little bugs, so be aware.","It's not so bad, but seems they tried to deceive review readers by making multiple Google map location.
- The location is not for tourist, should not open a hotel business around here.
- The bed's sheet smells like dog's sweat.
- The customer management is not professional enough
- Please leash and don't unstrain your dog !

Everything else is fine and good for me.
- A water dispenser is good
- A refrigerator is good
- WiFi is good
- Room style is good
- Responsibility and treatment are seems good",We were surprised how big was the room it had an upstairs bedroom with AC  downstairs bathroom small kitchen and sofa. The place itself looks artistic. Ladies working at the hotel were really lovely and helpful.,"Very unique hotel, beautiful, very nice staff, helpful. We rented a motorbike from them at a good price. We enjoyed our stay there. The place was like a small appartement with a couch, a fridge, desk... And they let us use their kitchen to cook so it was definitely a nice place to stay for us. There is an issue with some mice that visited us but they fixed it straight away. It’s an open wooden house so of course there are « visitors ». Don’t forget to put all the food in the fridge"

The villa was really cozy and pretty. The facilities were impressive, with cool swimming pool outside. However there are several aspects that can be improved. Maybe wardrobe closet & mirror can be added to each room upstairs. The rooms also needed some hangers to dry the towels and clothes. The living room area needed some air conditioning or at least a ceiling fan.

It has 4 rooms and private swimming pool. Friendly staff and easy to find in gmaps.,"Nice place. 4 big rooms with 4 queen size beds. WiFi provided. Only thing is living room no air conditioning. Upstairs master bedroom no sink. Downstairs master bedroom has sewage smell if diffuser turned off. If those are rectified, it would be a perfect five.","TThe place is HUGE and the facilities are pretty much great for an AirBnB. However, as our group consisted of 4 ladies, we were more than concerned when we realized that there's a bunch of young lads (locals) hanging out in the open air living room (of sorts) right in front of our villa (within the villa compound). They looked like the friends of the guy who greeted us when we arrived. These guys were rather noisy though and that noise lasted late into the night.","Good bed, cleaning well done every day.
