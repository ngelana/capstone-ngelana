I really appreciate this place's dedication to the environment and its truly amazing how they'd built these structures out of bamboo. For dinner there are some light vegetarian snacks available, but we ordered food and the drop off was super easy. The breakfast in the morning was amazing too, and brought right to our room. The staff also helped us coordinate a ride to get to our next location.

Definitely recommend if you are looking to take a relaxing break and unplug for a couple of days","Cottage all built in bamboo, it's magnificent!
The place is a bit difficult to access because the road is quite bumpy.  There are a few small houses scattered around the grounds, all of them very pretty.
I rented the ""Love"" cottage, with a heart-shaped bathtub overlooking the river... So romantic !
On 2 levels: 1 living room downstairs with terrace and view on the river and the forest + open bathroom, and 1 bedroom above with a superb and overhanging balcony.  The bed with mosquito net is comfortable.
Very decent breakfast, I took the local breakfast option.
I had a great time in this simple place surrounded by greenery.","We booked a family room for two nights, but unfortunately it was not very clean. There were no facilities available and the restaurant was closed, making it impossible to get food. The wall socket was too deep to plug anything in, the toilet dark and unclean, and several other amenities missing. It's clear that Bamboo Houses needs some serious care and maintenance; despite its beautiful appearance from a drone shot, this place feels abandoned.","The one serious problem here is its location. NOISE, 24hrs
Traffic noise being trucks, bikes, horns etc all night from the main road is unbearable loud.
We could not stay the 2 days we booked.
Left after 1st night.
Terrible terrible terrible.
People need to be told the truth of the non stop noise here.","This truly is a secluded eco villa, far from the hustle and bustle of a touristy neighbourhood. Other than the constant gushing sound of a neighbourly waterfall, it’s very quiet and relaxing. Morning breakfast in the balcony was a nice touch.

The place doesn’t get a perfect 5 out of 5 score because the customer service, how the staff greeted and communicated with us, left much to be desired.

There is a restaurant looking dining hall next to reception, but they don’t sell or serve any food. Be prepared to order via Gojek food or you’ll have to go bed hungry."
