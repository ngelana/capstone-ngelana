There is a waste / trash problem that needs to be maintained here,"It's been a while since the last time here. Now the river side looks so amazing with greenery grass and wonderful trees all the way the river side. Really cozy spot for chilling and enjoy afternoon moment with family and friends. A cheap picnic solution on the downtown of Denpasar. There's also many street vendors around the canals, so don't worry if you forget to bring on the foods. It feels like in Seoul's river somehow, not much but it bring the hype on. And don't forget the fishing rod if you have. Seems like there so many fish in all around the river.","I recently visited Taman Pancing and was immediately struck by the stunning natural beauty of the garden. The lush greenery and vibrant flora create a peaceful and serene atmosphere that is perfect for taking a relaxing stroll or just enjoying the view. The garden is well-maintained and the pathways are easy to navigate, which makes it an excellent place to spend a few hours in nature.

One of the highlights of my visit was the panoramic view of the surrounding area that Taman Pancing offers. From certain viewpoints within the garden, I was able to see the rolling hills and lush tropical forests that Bali is so famous for. It was truly a breathtaking experience that I will never forget.

Overall, I highly recommend a visit to Taman Pancing for anyone who wants to experience the natural beauty of Bali. The garden is easily accessible and offers a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. Whether you are a nature lover or just looking for a quiet spot to relax, Taman Pancing is a must-visit destination that won't disappoint.","Gotta pizza and pasta dish from an absolutely fantastic crew sat by the river to eat , again local area near where I live but genuine great service and food will be back walking distance from home","Luscious green grass with dirty river. Good for picnics or fishing or drowning,  whatever"

The ambience in the night is awesome and the for me who is vegetarian, it‚Äôs an advantage that they give free vegetarian dinner every night. Bang for the price.

""Bumbu"" according to Ibu Lara made Timbugan one of the best secret to be share with all tourists from and to the Bandara or Airport. Located in a main road to and from airport and this is why I would recommend Timbugan for your First  and last meals on Bali. Back to sambal... Their sambal mata is the one special here. From fresh ingredients to simply special coconut oil made the aroma bring out  typically Balinese palate playing in your every bite. No way to comment about their food. All are well cooked, served and presented. Most of my clients asked about their ice tea... Teh Melati is another special drink that you can enjoy here where the smell bring back your childhood memories. Can accommodate many customers at one time.

Historically known as a dish exclusively reserved for royalty, it was once served only to members of the royal family.
As soon as you open the nasi, the captivating fragrance tantalizes your senses, promising a meal fit for kings and queens. The rice, perfectly grilled and infused with succulent shrimp, exudes a smoky aroma that enhances its already luxurious taste.
Served alongside the rice is a refreshing local long bean karabu, adding a crunchy and tangy contrast to the dish.
Additionally, the grilled red baramundi or locally known as a
kakap merah provides a savory and tender complement to the ensemble. Each bite is a harmonious blend of textures and flavors, truly befitting its royal heritage.
A culinary gem not to be missed, Grill Rice at  Bali Timbungan offers a taste of royalty for all who visit.

The service is good and friendly",Best place to spend time with friends! Amazing entertainment and great service.,Angga the best server that i found club at Bali. Really recommended place to hang out. Cheers...,This place is terrible. Been waiting very long time to get any food and drink. Then the staff was standing right in front of us blocking the view the whole night. In the end the staff told us we have 200.000 IDR left to spend for the minimum spend. We said it's okay we don't need it. Then we left and in the parking area they told us we still owe them extra 600.000 IDR. We asked the bill and they charged us extra food and drinks we did not order at all. Not recommended

Kak Zai who assisted us, really friendly and great, helped us with the order and everything.
Will definitely come back.",Food was great. There are many soup options available as well as the meat snd veggies. Would definitely come back!,"This was our second visit to Chongqing Liuyishou hotpot during our stay in Bali. We came back for the beautifully prepared food but mostly for the attentive service.

Every request was catered for with a smile and nothing was too much. We have forgotten the waiters name but they took such great care of us we had to ask for a picture.

If you are a Hotpot fan this place needs to be on your list with a huge menu of wonderfully prepared meats, vegetables, noodles and tofu varieties.

PS. In the back area (outside) there is a family of very friendly cats üêà‚Äç‚¨õ who love to get pats ü•∞","Great Hotpot in Bali, chicken soup is great taste, will comeback on my next trip"

Very local so there might be some difficulty communicating but there is an English menu. Very affordable and one of the best meals I‚Äôve had in Bali :)))

Really recommend ikan pakar (bbq fish), seafood nasi goreng, merdeka crab!","I don't know why the taste of the food is so BAD, I don't recommend you eat here, the taste of the crab is very BITTER, even though I bought it at quite an expensive price!! PLEASE FIX IT, I WILL NOT EAT HERE AGAIN, I am so disappointed!! THE FOOD HERE IS NOTHING DELICIOUS. It's a shame that the feelings on social media and the original are the opposite!!! I bought a lot of menus here and they don't all taste good, it's better for you to just close than to disgrace the name of your restaurant","The highlight of our dish was the merdeka crab! But everything was very delicious and very affordable. The place felt very authentic as well. There were indonesian customers sitting next to us, and if the locals are dining there you know it‚Äôs a good sign.",We selected the fresh crabs and fish. The crabs had a special promo of buy 2 n 1 free. Cook in two styles. Thumb up!

I ordered half supreme yangneom chicken and it came out in big portion that enough for two people. The chicken has sweet-and-spicy taste, drizzle it with sweet mayo and it became creamy, ah what a heavenly taste! Their other dishes like Kimbap, Ramyeon, Sundubu Jigae and Toppoki are also worth to try. The restaurant located at 2nd floor, above their Korean mart.","Some foods are too spicy for me.
But I love the kimchi and fried chicken bowl.
It is located on the 2nd floor of a Korean convenience store.
The price is a bit high. For me, the chicken bowl by far is the dish that is enough to be shared with others. Other items on the menu are not really shareable (not too big of a portion), but it really depends on how much a person can eat! :)","Located on Jalan Sunset Road, K-Bunsik is a hidden gem in Bali. With a convenient store on the first floor and a cozy restaurant on the second, their take-away service impressed me. I ordered Tteokpokki and Naeng Myeon, which were ready in just 17 minutes. The flavors were extraordinary, and the service was excellent. K-Bunsik is a must-visit for anyone craving delicious Korean cuisine in Bali. Highly recommended! Disclaimer: This review reflects my personal experience and opinion at the time of my visit. Restaurant experiences may vary, so I encourage you to visit K-Bunsik and judge for yourself.","I like the gimbab, the taste is yummy and fresh, the bimbimbap also good. The restaurant locate in second floor, the first floor is korean store that sale korean stuff and food. No problem if you drive car or motorcycle, the parking space is quite wide.","authentic korean food
Nice place..comfort
Nice service and the food taste good"
