So better late than never. Made and Ayu offered me an amazingly kind-hearted and safe place to stay. This was such a relief to me, especially after the problematic experiences travelling on Bali as a female solo backpacker. I absolutely recommend to stay with this beautiful family!","A wonderful visit from start to finish. We did not want to leave. This homestay is a pure slice of Bali. We will have the memories with us always and are determined to return. The accommodations were exactly as described, the meals outstanding and the hosts warm and welcoming.","My girlfriend Marina and I had an amazing time staying with this lovely family in the peaceful village of Cepaka. Even though we arrived in the middle of the night, we got welcomed by Made and his sweet wife Ayu. They had upgraded our room, so we could stay in their beautiful Villa, because their homestay was fully booked - without any additional charge. The room had a lovely view, it was clean and had nice bathroom. An extra plus was the very fast and stable Wi-Fi.
We got to meet Made and Ayu's daughters Oka, Niki and Niti, who were so helpful and lovely. If we had any questions, they would gladly answer them.
Every night we had amazing traditionel Balinese food which Ayu and her daughters prepared for us.
All in all we can only recommend staying with Made Rai and his friendly family.","Amazing! They are so kind, helped us directly to carry our backpack, they cooked for us the dinner and it was delicious, big portion for a small price. We came for one night and I wish I could stay longer if my flight wasn't tomorrow. Best sleep in Bali, bed confortable, quiet, air conditioning... Recommand x1000!
Chris and Sarah","Great, wonderful, fantastic experience! Here you'll be hosted by a sweet family in clean and cozy room. The mother prepares food for guests. We took fried rice for lunch and crispy chicken with veges and rice which we ate at romantic table with candlelights in their garden. Tasty tasty tasty!
They all speak English perfectly, they help with your itinerary, you can borrow a map and guidebook. The are so warm and helpful people so you want to come back again soon.

I recommend going to Batu Balong beach for surfing lesson as well."

Beautiful garden on the territory - everything green.
The location is far from busy roads so it's always quite and guests can truly rest.
We enjoyed breakfasts and coffee sitting by the rice fields.
Very clean! And nicely decorated room with an open shower (can see stars at night), but they also have a mosquito net over the bed so nothing disturbs your sleep.
Also they have a high speed wifi for those who needs to work.
Thank you and hope to stay there again.",Lovely and peaceful place ! We arrived in Bali around 11pm and one cousin of Made waiting for us at the airport. Room comfortable and very good breakfast. My only regret is to stay just there for one night. Thanks again for your hospitality Made !,"Go here go here go here! This will be the best hidden gem in Bali. I was blown away by the kindness of Balinese people but Made and Wayan top that. They are I think the nicest people on Bali. The bungalow is great, the location is great. They helped us with getting around, they helped us with getting to a doctor and days after we left they even checked up on us if we were ok. Never in a holiday I met kind people like this. Go here go here go here :)!","Best home stay in Indonesia! Made and his family will make you feel like you are home. Good wifi, fantastic breakfast and dinner. They rent motorbikes or do tours...I regret only having spent there 3 nights, and I hope I can come back in the future. It¬¥s only 15 minutes by motorbike from Canggu.","Ok so I was dropped off in Canguu and the owner Madie came and collected me on his scooter - was so very sweet of him, really friendly family and so very kind. He gave me a folder or information on places to visit which was really helpful and did offer to arrange a trip if I wanted, with one of his friends. Breakfast was fresh every morning and very yummy. I did have a go on the scooter and unfortunately I was not confident at all so couldn't rent one off of them. I didn't want to endanger anyone or break the bike so decided against it. I did use gojek instead to get to Canguu as the centre is quite far away from here and there is nowhere to eat dinner. I also was put into one of the bungalows which was great because it was really beautiful, I slept really well at night it was peaceful and calm. The shower was good in pressure, even if a little chilly, as unfortunately it rained when I stayed so it was cold and having an outdoor bathroom made it quite cold, Madie did inform me the water is supposed to be hot but we figured later it was broken. I think as a solo traveller it was good, if you're a couple this would be perfect. Also if you have the confidence to ride a scooter no probs. I would recommend staying here purely because the family is so kind and genuinely lovely. :)"

There is three private bungalows with beautiful bathrooms (my personal love), most likely in the future they will have their own kitchens inside. Stayed here for a month. I am recommended.

The owners are very responsive, always ready to help, every day they check whether everything is fine, cleaning once a week. There is a well on the territory and the water is very good.

Notice: near the territory there is a local temple and a couple of times a month you will hear beautiful sounds at the evenings. Lots of dogs around.
The entrance to the territory is always open, there are no doors.",,,,
