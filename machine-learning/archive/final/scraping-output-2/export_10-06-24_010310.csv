I loved everything about this place from the design and the architecture to the very friendly and helpful staff to the food that was fresh and delicious.
The prices are a bit high but you can relax on a sunbed and use the pool for free so I'd say that is definitely worth it.","Perfect place to spend the day, chill by the pool and have some snacks. Quiet, relaxing atmosphere, great to get some work done or just sunbathe. Towels are free to use, and for now there is no minimum amount to spend. Also great place for families, child friendly pool and some sand toys. Lovely rice field view and really attentive staff.","Had a really great time here!

The staff were very nice, services were so good, the place and the ambiance were perfect. F&B were well served. Everything was enjoyable and definitely will come here again!

The only missing here was a sign, we went pass it and had to returned back because there‚Äôs no sign of this place.","My current fave pool club in Canggu.
It's the extension of Tickled Pink which I already loved.

A perfect hang-out for a lazy day by the pool, not so crowded - a very nice scene with good food and drinks. I would love if they could play just a little more music in the outdoor area.

I hope the place will stay clean and pretty.","We come here all the time for a swim drinks and snacks. Never been disappointed. Had breakfast for the first time this morning. Fantastic.
Friendly staff, great family atmosphere food was amazing highly recommended."

Had the egg benedict and was delighted to get a pink hollandaise sauce on top of the dish üòÜ Great spot to chill with plenty of parking space",Very nice restaurant & cafe with pretty good drinks and food. But the inside is a little humid hot. Overall good vibes with R&B music.,"Only a short 5minute gojek from Pererenan is this gem brimming with potential to explode as a future destination. Currently offering 2 restaurants, one with predominantly western cuisine the other traditional Balinese, this is by no means the finished product. Access to the pool area and sunbeds below is already available though this will extend into another pool once construction (which had no impact on our time here at all) is completed at which point there will also be a day club and hotel. What makes this place unique, is that it is surrounded by a designated green zone. Meaning the serene rice terraces that surround the venue cannot be developed...an opportunity lost in the likes of Canggu perhaps.

We went to tickled pink right on midday looking for a late breakfast. As is typical of Bali, the staff are just friendly: a trait I can never get enough of. The space is wide open and modern with animated prints which match the sculptures and decor. We ordered the Power bowl, (though I'll be going back for the scrambled croissant) And it was impressive. A mixture of light salad and cooked to perfection crunchy greens with added avocado and poached egg. Full of flavours and a nutritional boost. The fresh coconut we had to accompany it was chilled and the peanut butter smoothie a winner. We were one of only a few tables there, which will change. It just meant that on this occasion, in its infancy, we got to enjoy it mostly to ourselves (06.12.23)We also bought ourselves some gifts in the retail store at the front which has some really cool stuff. I'll probably make this a permanent destination on any further visits to Bali and I look forward to seeing how the operation evolves. Thank you for your professionalism and warmth","This is such a hidden gem. In the middle of rice fields, quiet, away from all the Canggu noise. It has a pool with nice sunbeds, outside area and inside if you dont like a heat. Food is amazing, big portions, A LOT OF CHOICE and amazing coffee! We had savory breakfast, some smoothies, coffee and acai bowl for ""dessert"" (I didnt like the caramel on top, but this is just my personal preference). Would highly recommend! Also a great place to work :) 10/10","Breakfast with the view of paddy field.
They also has pool for you to enjoy.
So far since they just open, there is no min spend on the day bed.
Tickled pink has combined open air area with artworks such as painting, statue.
Food was okay.
Price wise same with others.."

Unfortunately only a view if you sit on second floor and outside.

Friendly staff , place is new and only opened recently , not so busy yet as the area is under development.","The venue is superb, beautiful interior design. We thought it will be expensive but it's not that much compared to other Japanese themed resto in Denpasar.
We love the seaweed salad.
The sushi is as expected for the price. Only thing is that deep fried sushi with raw fish inside is such a shame. Good quality raw fish taste is drowned by overwhelming deep fried taste. In my opinion it's unnecessary.","When I went there during lunch time, not so many people inside, prolly around 3-4 tables only. It didn‚Äôt take long time to wait for the food after I ordered mine. I ordered 2 sushi and 1 potato salad. Not the best one, but ok for sushi around Munggu (I did have high expectation due to its design that is so Japanese).
The bad thing was, my cold ocha came when I finished all of my food. I think they forgot my drink, as it didn‚Äôt take much time to serve the ‚Äúready to drink‚Äù ocha. The waitress was not standby onbthe 2nd floor and I have to go down to ask for my drink.
Hope my next visit will be better, maybe I will order other menus.",Great Japanese restaurant with tasty fresh sushi and other dishes. Very good quality for the price you pay! Definitely recommend!,"Food is decent.  But the service tonight was so terrible.  New staff, don't speak English whatsoever, doesn't even make an effort.  Look at each other like a typical Balinese Indonesian style - may I repeat your order?  And still make a mistake.  Never going there again after this visit.  Terrible."
