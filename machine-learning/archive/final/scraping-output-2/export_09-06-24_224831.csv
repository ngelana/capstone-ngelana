A lovely little resort next to the beach, nice a quiet. Good sized and clean rooms. Restaurant menu is a bit limited, but the quality of the food served is good. Staff were exceptional, made us feel very welcome.","Located close to the West Bali National Park, it is peaceful and quiet on the edge of a clean beach, very good for all activities. Around us we can also see Balinese starlings (Bali's mascot).",Great place in Bali😊,,

Very modern building with two rooms, both having a view on the sea. Huge and deep pool and a big garden. The place is very secluded so it is more for those who are looking for a quiet and peaceful place in beautiful nature.","Beautiful villa to stay, right on the beach facing the island of Java, top place to watch sunset.
Spacious villa with 2 bedrooms, a large swimming pool, a friendly maid.
If you are looking for a peaceful place to stay right on the beach in Bali, I totally recommend Blue Gecko Villa","Nice Villa in the front of Semaya Beach, has large private pool, sunset deck and complete utensils for a longer stay. But the best part is the staff, Mbok Ni Made is very nice, warm and helpful person. Her nasi goreng is absolutely wonderful.","This villa very nice view and nice manager.^^ if you want to refresh, you will go there now. Good manager will be prepare everything you needs.","Very nice

The views are amazing!,"We are tourists here and I can only recommand that restaurant!!! The food (grilled fish, noodles soup and a fried rice plate) was simply delicious! Just by the beach makes it better especially with à coconut for drink... Service is also super and very friendly and talkative (speak english wich is nice for tourists)","The place is nice and comfortable.  The view is absolutely outstanding.  😁😁😁 there's only one critic.  I think,  the dish is not really tasty,   good,  but not as much as it can make me give my thumbs 👍👍 up.  The fish and the soup are almost plain, the ""sambal""  is not spicy at all,  it only fill with tomatoes.  But don't worry,  if they put more seasonings to the dish and and  chilli for the ""sambal""  it will be very nice and delicious.
😁😁😁😁",Great location right off the beach. Freshly caught fish grilled on wood was fantastic. Highly recommended.
