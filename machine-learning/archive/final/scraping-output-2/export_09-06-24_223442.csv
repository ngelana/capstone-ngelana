Banjar, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81152, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=15420409571085323614,OPERATIONAL,+62 362 92901,spa,"tourist_attraction, swimming_pool, spa, sports_complex",4.3,3282,,Convenient location and good access to hot springs. There are parking lots for cars and bikes. The smallest number of visitors three hours before closing. I get great pleasure from the velvety warm water. Good relaxation and recovery of the body. I recommend it.,"Its healing waters, combined with the beautiful setting, make it a memorable part of any Bali itinerary !","The spring was not very great. The water was lukewarm  and greenish (with algae?). It is fall hazard everywhere with slippery steps and algae coated pool base.. They have 3 different pools, small wading pool, 1m - 1.5m swimming pool (large) and a smaller wading pool.
The surroundings and lush greenery are great to look at, but sadly not the pools. The changing rooms and toilets are absolutely filthy and reeked.
We didn't spend more than 30 minutes.","Really nice place with 3 pools of warm water in a beautiful setting in the middle of the forest. We had the chance of going in a day with not to many people, go in the early morning. I suggest to avoid white swimming suit because the sulfur on water stains the tissue.","I always came here with my family back then when I was a child. It was a beautiful memory. Fortunately, a couple of days ago, I had a chance to visit this place again. The ambiance remains the same. I can see some foreigners having their time here. The entry tickets is very affordable for local nd also for foreign tourists. Don't worry, it's hard for you to rinse after taking a shower, the water here is clean and there are lots of changing rooms. ðŸ˜€"

This place was included in a tour package and was last on our list. The place is really well maintained and clean. There were not too many people when I was here. The springs were amazing!!! Many people were swimming, but it is also just nice to sit in the spring and relax. Do not put your face under water! The changing rooms had a lot of water on the floors, but that is understandable as it is open to the public and everyone makes use of it. The workers were friendly and were willing to assist with direction as needed. It was a wonderful experience. I definitely recommend a stop here","The hot springs are a reasonable price and nice and hot...
New and modern design too..
You get a towel and there are changing rooms for your convenience..
We met some really nice balinese people that wanted to chat with us..
The veiw is fantastic far better than the camera could ever show..
What a great way to absorb the veiw in comfort of a warm and healing hot spring.
We would definitely visit again.","Facilities are nice, but the water was tepid at best, very disappointing. Was also sad to be harassed by the lady at the booth to the left of the entrance when I asked the price of something and she then frantically pled with me to purchase the item over, throwing a tantrum, causing a scene and being incredibly disrespectful. It wasn't enough that I tried my best to treat her with respect and politely tell her no thank you, but she had to then harrass me again when I went back to my scooter to leave and was extremely aggressive again, which is a tactic to make a tourist so uncomfortable that they just give in and purchase the item. If the other vendors want to maintain their reputation, they should speak up against such behavior and help protect tourists.","Banjar hot spring has several pools for swimming, high shower, low shower, with a 20x20 meter main pool where the water comes from the shower pool, the temperature in this sulfur water is around 50Â° to 35Â° Celsius.",Throughly enjoyed. Pls visit here and take bath at Holy Hot Spring. All facility is here.
