It felt a lot like rural Jamaica and I enjoyed walking up to the sound of the rooster. But just in case we didn't, our host gave us earplugs so we would not be disturbed by the rooster's call.

The host, Putu and his sweet family, were very nice and warm. I would definitely stay here again.","Putu was great. The room was okay, just needed it for the night. Bed was comfortable. Good temperature for the shower and the AC in the room worked well.

Putu made it all a pleasure.","Agastha Villa is in a great location next to the main road, and the major locations on west part of the island are close by and easily accessible. Accesibility to tembling beach and forest which is not too far, and going to east part of the island from this location is easy due to main road accessibility.

Putu and his wife were very hospitable. The best part of this stay is that all facilities are available in house including a restaurant which has reasonably charged simple but good food options, laundry facilities, bike rental service, pick up and drop to the harbour, etc. They even have a small and clean pool to relax. Putu is super friendly, and extremely helpful with great hospitality. He helped us with our needs, and gave us great suggestions with regard to planning our trip. His family and himself took good care of us.

Highly recommend this place.",What a wonderful stay with Putu and his family! Nice little place with just 4 Bungalows and pool to relax. They serve tasty food and breakfast is great. We loved to hang out in the evening on our terrace. Location is great to explore the island. Hosts are always available to help you with anything and the prices are more than fair. Overall great experience and we would love to stay there again.,"This was our my partner and I‚Äôs best stay in Bali! Putu and his family were extremely kind and hospitable. Putu also offered us great tips about getting around in Bali as well as very fair tour and transport prices! They were the kindest people we‚Äôve met here, and I would recommend anyone who comes to Nusa Penida to stay with them! :)"

We had clear communication from both owners of how to get from Bali to the island and we then had a car arranged to take us to the accommodation (we were two couples). Norman constantly made me laugh and tony constantly filled us with knowledge of where to go, and he has a very inspiring story of how he got there! ;)
Wonderful food and beers. Pool was out of action due to a storm but we got a swim in there at the end. We also rented scooters from the accommodation. I loved he bungalow and the outside shower! Can‚Äôt wait to go back :)

A little tip: you must pay in cash (so get the cash on Bali) :)","When I booked i wasn't that excited to get to this place, 31st March 2019, but once I got in there the location, rooms and the setup of this resort was just Awesome! that I extended for another day stay. 2days was just too short to be at this place, The setup of this resort is more of a traditional type n there are good vibes around. Thanks to Tony and Norman for having us there. Had a great conversation with both of them. Regards Srinivas. Hope to see you next time and good luck with the new project at Crystal bay.",I want to give a HUGE thank you to the amazing staff here at Kubo Reot for their generosity and kindness. A bit over a month ago my partner and I got into a moto accident near here and we really needed help. Two of the staff drove by us and brought us to the resort. My partners foot was punctured and bleeding a lot. All of them helped to clean her foot with warm water and sanitised it. If we didn't get your guys help I'm not sure she'd be as healthy as she is now. You really saved the day. Thank you to all of you ladies! I would definitely recommend staying here. You will be taken care of very well.,"One person was very kind, but none of the staff speak English. Only a third of the menu was available (with very little portions). Ants everywhere, dogs and chicken making noise all night. Can't use the swimming pool, shower had so poor water flow... Not worth the price (not at all)","Nice and comfortable rooms and beautiful surrounding. Owner is very helpful and speaks English very well which is not popular skill. I would give 5 stars, but he recommended to us the snorkling in manta bay, but he knew it was a waste of time (too strong tides, too many people, not many or no mantas). Apart from that rest was ok."

They cut the whole shrimp out and call it seafood‚Ä¶very disappointing. Really not worth the rating. And too many flies everywhere in the restaurant, poor hygiene. STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED. Don‚Äôt let your tour guy take you to this restaurant.","The food is excellent!!!!! I had the yummiest spicy chicken noodles. Be prepared for big portions. I ordered onion rings and thought I'd get a few but was shocked by the big plate.
The prices are also very reasonable.",Excellent and affordable option of Indonesian food and desserts personally I recommend the chilli chicken noodles and the fried banana,Very few options in Nusa Penida for light lunch included as part of a package trip... Limited veg options... Try their Smoothie bowls and Capcay veg... Awesome üëçüèºüëçüèº,"We did a day tour to the west side of nusa penida and between snorkling and checking out the viewpoints, our guide brought us here for an early lunch. It offers both traditional Indonesian dishes as well as western style fare, and we did not hesitate to take advantage of that. There is indoor and outdoor seating, and it‚Äôs a nice spot to rest for a bit. We ordered a mix of dishes - a traditional fish soup, chicken chili noodles, french fries ;) and banana pancakes. The noodles were way too saucy and a tad spicy, and our least favorite overall. It reminded me of a takeout chinese dish, overbearing and not particularly tasty, but decent. The fish soup was clean and simple and a nice contrast to the noodles. The french fries had that old school starchy taste to it, we ate it all. The banana pancakes were a generous portion and a nice batter, I preferred the plain taste of it without the chocolate syrup but it makes for a striking dish. We had great service there and it quickly filled up with other tour groups as we finished up. There are bathrooms for use. We enjoyed our meal here and are thankful our guide brought us here to try it!"

Best wishes for prosperous businesses to the whole family.","The owners were super nice and friendly! When you've got some problems, they are very helpful.
The bungalows are very city, pretty and clean. The service is also great.
Breakfast is nothing special, but really okay.
Would definitely come back.","Excellent care takers. Very affectionate, helping and kind. The cottage is very clean & well maintained with most facilities and has close proximity to most of the Western penida beaches. Highly recommend the care takers at the site for the amazing hospitality, attitude & their humbleness.","The place is super cozy, extremely clean and the stuff very helpful. However I had a very hard check in in a super rainy day. I couldn‚Äôt contact with the hotel due a lack of internet. Nobody was in reception at that time. After that everything was great.
After that everything was good. Internet was perfect in the 1, 2 and 3 bungalow after this it gets a bit tricky. The deliver foos if you need it. Very worth it for the prize I paid."
