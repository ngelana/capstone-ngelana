Both were super fun and the guides were all very friendly and helpful. Would recommend! We booked it via our hotel (Como Shambhala).,"Highly recommend, we loved it and suitable for all ages","It was a two hour trek from seminyak, it was great to get out of the city and see a bit of a country side. It was all very professional and when we got there they had replaced all the buggies with new ones that are four-wheel drive. We had a blast driving them around the countryside. The last time we came it was raining and quite a bit more exciting than was today, but it was still fun!!","Wow, what an experience!!
This one is for all ages. You can drive or be the passengers.
We used 2 quads and 1 bike. We are family of 4 and one assistant.
Kids, 7 and 13 yo. We're from Jakarta.
Its safe adventure!
My husband rode with my youngers son in ATV bike, our assistant with my older son,
And I rode as a passenger with Bali discovery pilot.
Along the way, my older kid switch from AtV to quad , just for experience.

I am not the bravest person in the world, and I stil very much enjoy the whole trip.

Ask for Pak Made and Pak Wayan for your pilot guide if you dont want to ride.
They are skillful and experiences. We felt safe along the trip.
Their tagline is SafetyFirst.

Next just enjoy the beauuutiful forest, plantation, rice terrace and village.
My sons trully loved their ride. I am grateful for able to give them this opportunity.

Dont hesitate, it will be the best 2 hours experience in Bali!","What a nice bunch of gays. They went out of their way to make our trip fun. We had a breakdown on one of the bikes, but they had a replacement within minutes. Really worth the money."
