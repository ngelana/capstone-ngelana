So careful, kind and welcoming owner and his family. Decent bungalows, cleaning everyday, great view from the pool and cafe and so special atmosphere of true Bali. Thank you, Nyoman!","Beautiful location and villas, good food, great atmosphere and very nice people. Thank you especially for entertaining and feeding our little kids so we could enjoy dinner! We definitely recommend!","Here you will find the real Bali!

We really enjoyed the stay here and wanted to stay even longer. Nyoman, the host, explained everything we wanted to know about the Balinese culture. The bungalows and the ocean view are amazing! Also the pool was amazing. Everything was nice and clean. We also had our own outdoor kitchen at our bungalow. This is the place to slow down and relax. But you can also visit a lot of places here. Like virgin beach, tukad cepung waterfall and the watertempel. You can find everything you need here, like small supermarkets and restaurants. Their own warung was soooo good (the red snapper fish is a must!). We felt really welcomed here. Thank you Nyoman for having us, we travelled for a month trough Bali and this was definitely a highlight!","Such an amazing place to stay! A beautiful rooms, very tasty food, unbelievable view and incredible anf kind host! Thank you very much for this incredible experience.
À bientôt","If you're looking for a little paradise here is the place.

A team that listens to you which is very kind
And the room was perfect, a plus for the swimming pool
We spent a couple days there and we will come back again
Once again thank you ☺️"
