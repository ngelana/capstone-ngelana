ChIJKwqd3Ecj0i0Rmx6ya_l9ETE,SARI SEDANA HOME STAY,-8.4377133,115.2409592,"H66R+W98, Melinggih Kelod, Payangan, Gianyar Regency, Bali 80572, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=3535745692669714075,OPERATIONAL,+62 822-3799-8200,private_guest_room,"private_guest_room, lodging",3.5,23,,"This room is more than adequate for the price offered.  only 10$ for one night.  if you want to stay long in Bali.  better stay here.  But don't compare their service and location to a 5 star hotel priced at 150$.  friendly host.  there are 2 cute dogs at home.  you can learn Balinese life there.  see local people's farms.  close to rice fields.  You can go for a walk in the morning and evening.  Near the house there is also a night market, shopping shops only 2 minutes from the house.",I laughed at the bad reviews.ü§£ at 10$ for one night. this room is more than adequate. very cheap for those who want to stay long in Bali. the old house is also friendly. shopping places are very close. 2 minutes by motorbike. 2 weeks stay here. like living in your own house and there are 2 cute dogs there. their names are viki and viko ü•∞ü•∞üå∫,"this place is terrible as another person wrote about it. the doors have huge gaps. The air conditioner cannot lower the humidity below 70% and dry out the air.
through the door you can hear everything like on the street and this is not an exaggeration.
Just outside the door there is a chicken coop in which the chickens are sitting in cages and cannot stand on their feet. they start screaming at 5:30 am every day and only stop screaming after the sun goes down. Right across the road there is a temple where residents from all over the village come, a man has been shouting into the microphone since the very morning. from 5:30 for several hours in a row all day. and beats the drums. You can hear all this as if you were standing nearby.
It's unbearable.
The owner of the property responds to messages after 1-3 hours. he actively takes part in the ceremony and has no time to deal with the requests of the guests. I got the impression that for him guests are like those chickens in cages just for making money and their comfort doesn‚Äôt bother him at all.
the shower was broken, the tap was leaking, everything was worn out and it could be fixed in one day but he doesn't.
The owner satisfied only half of all requests.
On the 6th day, all 4 of my pillows were rotten and the owner never changed my pillows. Last night I slept without pillows because they stank of chicken droppings. I kept the doors closed all the time and hung a blanket over the door to make less noise. In addition, a terrible stench of chicken droppings could be heard from the street.
hot water appeared on the second day when I made a remark that there was none. I thought that there was none at all, but then I saw that he had heaters outside and he simply did not turn on the hot water for me. I ended up catching a cold and getting very sick. I begged the owner for an hour to buy me basic medications because he didn‚Äôt even have a thermometer and paracitamol at home.
he agreed only for an additional money.
I could not recover for 4 days due to the constant noise that did not stop even at night. sometimes the roosters crowed even at 3:30 in the morning.
In my village the roosters didn‚Äôt behave like that, my grandmother raised them, they didn‚Äôt crow constantly all day, only at dawn and at sunset the rooster crowed for a few minutes and that‚Äôs it. but this owner seems to have no control over his cattle.
In the end, I was able to recover only on the 6th day. the first two days I had a terrible migraine and nausea and I could not get out of bed and the owner did not help me in any way. I only advised him to go to the hospital. but in my condition I could not reach it.
I left this place after 6 days and still have 5 days left. The owner did not return my money for these 5 days. although it is not his money and he did not deserve it.","Relaxed atmosphere in a beautiful setting, hosts are lovely.  A walk through the rice fields is recommended, very peaceful.  Short walk to shops and a great market.","such a great first experience in bali!

just to clarify, this is not a luxury experience. the rooms are adequate but nothing special. the location is close to convenience but you will need transport to any noteworthy locations. basically, you get what you pay for.

the host welcomed us so warmly, we hadany chats about bali and its culture, and he suggested some great local spots to try (the night market was a great dinner experience). far from the bustle of ubud center, this is the perfect place to take in more of the culture and natural beauty, in a community that moves slower than the tourist hubs.

if you want a comfortable suite in a tropical paradise, keep searching. but if youre tight on funds and looking for the real bali, i cannot recommmend this enough!"
