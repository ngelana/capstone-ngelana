We came here multiple times during our stay because we absolutely loved the food

They have happy hour during 4-9pm and the cocktails are even cheaper!!
You also get a free bowl of nachos with sauce
Highly recommend","Big Mexican food menu, tacos half price on Sundays 7-Close, decent food, pool table on upper deck. Friendly staff and good vibes.

The refrigerator was missing from the room for me, restaurant was not opened at this time, maybe the bar was.. it was always empty, where you can buy 0,5 l water bottles.
Due to the location, people do not spend much time in their rooms, I guess there is nothing to do.

Wifi was not enough to make videos for my work.
You have to go somewhere to see something during your stay. You can easily reach the beaches and one of the main street close by.  And because of this, it is not disturbing that there is a huge construction going on in the spot opposite side of the road. Also uphill...scooters and motorists accelerate up the hill, it's noisy. I loved the place and the room, fresh white cleaner come every day.Ffirst place in in long time, everything fitted into the wardrobe:)
Monkeys in the garden and over the place terrace was fun!","That was underwhelming! My partner‚Äôs main meal was fine, but the rest was not. The calamari was chewy, but tasted okay.

This cosy home stay hotel was the perfect choice for us whilst staying in Ulu. The staff were all so friendly and helpful during our stay which made the experience really enjoyable.

The rooms were very clean and had great air con. Two pools which very cooling and relaxing.

The location was right next to Thomas beach and a short drive on the bike to Padang Padang beach. Directly opposite were little shops which you could get your essentials and also a brilliant Mexican restaurant where you could also chill and play pool/billiards.

Bike rental was available from the hotel and this was really helpful as big demand for bikes in uluwatu.

A short 9min walk to a fantastic cafe called suka or about 1 min on the bike.

We would easily stay here again whilst visiting uluwatu.","Decent little place, the bungalows are a bit old and could do with an upgrade (especially the bathroom), but the garden was nice and calm and room had good AC.

1- The bathtub location is in the middle of the room and the toilet has no door - not suitable for non couples

5- Breakfast options are so limited (3 options  included options for paid breakfast) and the coffee tasted like dirt ( the coffee was not filtered).
6- Pool looks way smaller in reality and the pool area looks dirty.
7- Bed sheets smelled like body odor the first night not sure if they were clean.
8- No yoga services.","I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately it really kinda sucked. The best things are the location, yoga studio and some of the local staff. The worst things list is long as this place is a total rip off. We paid nearly $200 a night and couldn't even get basic housekeeping services such as towels (we literally got given one holey towel to share and then got told no for any replacements, then they took our towel away and we had to beg to get any towels and then got given hand towels to dry ourselves with instead of bath towels). On top of the towel issues, the bed sheets had holes and never got replaced in a 5 night stay, the floorboards were stuck down with sticky tape, we lost power to our room for an extended period (which they couldn't fix even though the rest of the resort had power?) and finally I have developed a weird rash from sitting on the dirty pillows by the pool. There also should be a warning on this place if you are allergic to cats, they are everywhere and your room will have cat hair. Finally the windows don't shut so there are mosquito's everywhere at night in your room and they gave us a big bath which couldn't be filled at all due to lack of water pressure and hot water. I don't know who is writing good reviews for this place but I would be suspicious as we mostly heard people complaining in person. I would recommend to stay anywhere else.","Very cool yoga shala.

PROS: very nice garden
CONS: too high price for what they offer here, no cleaning, dirty at check- in, leaking ceiling when rain, filthy air conditioning machine, clogged shower, I was sick saying here, I had to go to the clinic, due to the construction dust, and the moisture in the room. We had to cancel our reservation, too expensive for the price, even is located by Padang Padang, it has a big hill to go in and out. You wake up every day to a guy sweeping the garden at 6 am.

As soon as we arrived we could smell the musty smell inside the room. We didn‚Äôt know that this would be our smaller problem. The accommodation is completely dirty, it is disgusting, the bathroom, the floor, everything. Less than 6 hours after we arrived we found a huge spider, we thought it would be due to the trees around the hotel. However, in the same night we found 3 HUGE cockroaches and some types of worms. In the morning, we also found a small lizard in the bathroom. We tried a refund with the manager, just because we already paid for more days and we would like to find another hotel, he said that it is not possible. Now, we are desperate just thinking about our next terrible night. Pleas, follow the pictures.","Great place to stay! Very nice guesthouse where they made an extra bed for our friend downstairs, very comfortable. Kind staff and you can also rent scooters here. Mosquitos here are most active around 5 in the afternoon, but with the right protection you‚Äôll be more than fine.

Great aesthetic over all","Pool is huge, room is very nice there is parking space for bikes. Best location! 5 minutes walk to amazing Thomas beach. Lots of very good restaurants walking distance and 10 minute walk to uluwatu best surfing spot! Owner and staff awesome. Terimakasih ü§ô","Care, the hotel is near the road, on booking there is no refound in case you don‚Äôt like something, luckily owner refounded us 50%.

It is a beautiful place just right by Padang-Padang-Beach with a lot of good restaurants around. We would definitely come again!"

We can‚Äôt recommend it enough and most certainly can‚Äôt wait to return! Thank you for everything. We‚Äôll see you soon!,"Could not recommend Rumah enough! We had the best month here and felt so at home.

Best accommodation in Uluwatu ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks for having us Galo & Family.","I want to be like Galo at 70.

This is what you will keep repeating yourself the more you will get in touch with the owner. He has a great positive vibe, always in the middle of some business but will always find time for a smile and a chat with you.

Do not misunderstand me, the place is amazing, it is located in a quite area in Uluwatu, close to many great spots and also in the middle of the nature. The rooms are bigger than what they look and you can work remotely here for long periods.

But what bounds the people here are Galo and Ketut (wife), always organizing barbecues, playing guitar, singing all together and sharing life experiences. Try this accommodation and you will find a place to feel home.

I want to be like Galo at 70. Did I mention that?","There is so many good things to say about Rumah Wayan.

For the past 10 months my girlfriend and I have lived in more than 15 places throughout Bali - and Rumah Wayan is the best, by far.

Galo and Ketut is the best hosts you can wish for

The staff is friendly and serviceminded

The internet is great (I had meetings everyday without any problems)

The rooms are big, private and cozy

The common area is a place where we had a lot of talks and fun with other guests

The location is the best in uluwatu, close to everything.

We are coming back, that is for sure üôèüèº","My wife and I stayed here for a few days at the end of our honeymoon. Wayan and his staff were amazing and super friendly. Breakfast each morning was delicious and filling, and Wayan had several scooters available for rent (Honda Vario 125, all in great shape). The rooms were big and clean, the common area was inviting and had a great stereo system and a few guitars. The pool was clean and refreshing. When we left, Wayan even took the trip with us to the airport to chat a bit more. If you're debating staying here, do it! The location is great and you won't regret it. Thanks again Wayan!"

villa is lovely, located very centrally in Uluwatu. would be a perfect stay for relaxing if weren‚Äôt for the monkeys.
It is absolutely annoying that you are always forced to keep doors shut and can‚Äôt leave any personal belongings outside, for example while relaxing at the nice pool area. once, we even had monkeys in our room trying to steal our stuff after we left the door open for only a few minutes. this fact is not mentioned anywhere in the description. furthermore, since the bathrooms are outside and therefore also easily accessible by monkeys, you can‚Äôt leave any of your stuff there. we therefore didn‚Äôt feel comfortable to shower or use the bathroom.","we had a terrible stay. we arrived at 12 am and were talking to the host on the phone that we arrive early and she let's the staff know, but the only thing that the staff said was ""you are early!""

the villa is in a way worse state than advertised. nothing is well maintained and nobody cares about complaints. the scooter rental was the most expensive in whole bali.

there are a couple of restaurants in walking distance but the road is not lit and it's dangerous to walk there. so you definitely need a scooter

we had 2 seperate double rooms with outdoor shower. but the outdoor bathroom is really bad designed because it was raining and the toilet is not really under a roof.

I really can't recommend this place. way too expensive for what it offers, there a better options all over bali.","nice staff, clean and good condition room. you can get to 10 minute to ppadang ppadang beach and thomas beach. but there is no walk way","Very nice Villa with Aircon, Tv and pool. Wifi is working but sometimes very slow. We really enjoyed the stay there.","Very nice place, good rooms and  facilities, nice staff and excellent services .. will stay here again üíìüíìüíì"

The stairs in the resorts are ridiculous, some of them are some 30-40cm and really unpleasant to walk and get quite slippery when it rains. Cottages are not that nice and seem to be unfinished: No glass windows, only blinds, a lot of concrete, the water in our cottage couldn't go into the sink because of the floor. Moreover the rooms smell and what is a no-go is that you can literally hear EVERY word your neighbors say, and there are 4 rooms in one cottage, so 8+ people that could have conversation through the walls.. We didn't spend too much time in the resort which is why the room situation didn't weigh much for us, that's why I still gave 3 stars..","Atmosphere is nice and the view from the pool as well. The rooms are big, but just semi clean. The sheets were dirty or at least had stains on them. Also the facilites were unsafe! The shower and faucet fittings give you small electric shocks, something you don't like to seer with water. Speaking of which we didn't have on two occasions. The breakfast wasn't good at all on top of that. The Location was good,you're in the center of everything but at the same time back in the jungle.","PROs: +Incredibly unique and relaxing ambiance, +Fantastic staff, +Small resort = less people, +Great food & drinks, +Remote location

CONs: -Paper thin walls (you can hear your neighbors as if you were in the same room), -Bathrooms are not fully enclosed, -The walk to the beach is close, but it can be tough with the incline/decline/heat, -Remoteness = far away from everything unless you have a motorbike, -Lots of stairs!

Overall a great hotel, my wife and I enjoyed our time here--especially at the pool. There isn't much to do around these parts, but I think it's meant to be a getaway from the city life.","Fantastic place to stay.... when quiet. Very much a backpacker place. Very thin walls. We could hear everything from other guests but the rooms are clean and nicely decorated. The pool is stunning!! The manager really looks after his guests but the staffs really need some training. Really hard to express ourselves as their English is below basic. Zero can-do attitude, always finding excuses. Not to accomodate guests. Saw staff drinking beers with friends At the restaurant area which was weird. Music can be a bit heavy during lunch until late evening. Techno, trap music ... always had to ask to change it couple of time a day.

Food is below average, small portion and quite pricey for Bali.

Unfortunately 2 stars because of some serious lack of care in terms of renting a scooter, ripoff mafia taxi price from hotel and poor hospitality from staff. Serious issues with 3 scooters rented through the hotel and no accomodation for payment when nothing states that scooter rental and hotel fees are two different things. they did not give us any alternative payement and had to abide and pay cash (as if we carry cash at the end of vacation...) It turned our vacation through a bitter end.","An oasis of tranquility in the busy Padang Padang area. Great food, very reasonable prices and friendly staff.

The atmosphere is perfect, with design tables and chil ambience.

Nachos are just OK, but the beef stew with coconut is mind blowing. Spicy chicken with rice is also very tasty. If you make it to the desserts, the fried banana with caramel syrup made my day.

All this summed up to no surprises of hidden costs at the checkout made this a great superchil experience."
