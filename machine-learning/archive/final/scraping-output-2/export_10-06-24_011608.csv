I would personally not be rushing back. I was looking for a quieter place to work for an hour and realised quickly enough this place was not going to tick that box for me.
Quite a poky place. No air-conditioning. Wrong acoustics.
Unreasonably high stools by the breakfast bar. The  other tables (5)  were not suitable for a comfy stay either.
I would have expected more vegan options but I guess, coming from Ubud, I had been too spoiled for choice there. None of the biscuits/cakes on display were vegan or GF.

Acai bowl looked pretty, but the acai itself was not as tasty as when it is mixed with coconut milk. It didn't taste like much, and it was a bit watery too.
The toppings were lovely though.
Staff seemed a bit inexperienced and not all happy to be there, but they were helpful enough.","We went here for breakfast twice and really love the place! Super nice atmosphere in the green, very good food (we had a smoothie bowl, fruit platter, egg dishes and avo toast, all very good). A big variety of juices, smoothies, and detox shots and very good coffee, too. Staff was very nice."

I was supposed to stay for a week, but finding a real unpleasant smell in the toilet (mould at the ceiling), no place to chill by the (dirty) pool area. The staff is hard to communicate with, and there is a lot of noise from construction around the area, made me want to leave after one night. I had to pay full price (4.000.000 IDR) in cash, no receipt, and then they told the booking site I used that I never showed.

Nice rooms with nice bed, but bathroom could be better. But there is hot water, that is great. Small pool outside also nice. You can refil your water bottle and owner is nice. We had nice stay, just rooms are quite dark.","The rooms we got were clean.
The staff were very responsive upon my request of providing fresh towels - twice in 6 nights stay - providing a watter butt just for my private use, and two extra pillows.
I would avoid Room no.2, should I stay there again, though, as the view of the pool from the terrace was fully obstructed by the dorm's occupants' garments on the clothesline!!
The walk to the beach is around 50 minutes, so it's not the easiest.
The Balangan beach itself, though, is one of the best!!
Overall, it is good value for money if you stay in rooms # 3 to 5.","My friend and me stayed in a single room. The room was equipped with a mosquito net, AC and fan. Also, the room was clean. The receptionist of the homestay was very kind and helpful. The atmosphere was familiar. The homestay is located close to several surf spots.

It doesn't look like the one in the picture"" lol. It's totally way below under our expectations. The pool is not clear and very rare to be circulated. Once we jumped into the pool our hair turn so hard like floor brush. On the 3rd day, the water turns brown bcs of the project on the road somewhere.

However, the service is nice, the place is quiet, and that's all what we enjoyed.
Hope you can improve next time :)","We stayed at Arjuna Guest House in 2022 and in 2023, four times for a total of 6 months. We loved this place!
The owners are locals and they are incredible nice people, they invest time and dedication for their place.
The Caretaker, also a very friendly girl,  is between 9am and 5pm at the location and take care of the place: cleaning, check ins, scooter rent.
At this location you have also the possibility to rent a scooter. Pool in the garden. Shared outside kitchen where you can cook something if you want, fridge also in the kitchen. They provide also drink water. The rooms are basic, minimalistic, cleaning is everyday provided, warm water.
From here you can access by scooter few different beaches in a time range from 7 minutes to 30 minutes. The Guest House is situated in a small village, with locals restaurants around, laundry service nearby.

I have stayed there twice already and would come back again!","This is where we stayed in Bali for first few days in last August 2022. We booked personal villa for 3 nights and it was a wholesome experience. Will definitely stay here again in our next Bali trip.
Pros-
1. The Villa with the prrivate pool is superb and very well maintained. The housekeeping was done daily too.
2. Simona is a superb host. As a first time traveller to Bali we had so many questions and she has helped with everything.
3. The location of this place is also good if you are like us who likes to stay far from noisy streets.
4. They run the cafe only for the breakfast. The food is tasty and staffs are cordial.
5. They also help with scooter rentals. But try to understand the little details (like the stand needs to be completely up for the engine to self start) of older Balinese scooty.
Cons-
1. Nothing much but just that the bedroom is quite big and the AC fails to adequately keep the room cool. Speed of the ceiling fan needs to be improved.","We've been traveling in Indonesia for four weeks and spent our last 10 days at Bali Mynah Villas. It was wonderful and one of the best homestays we stayed in! The bungalows are surrounded by a lovely and clean garden with a pool (the private bungalows even had a private pool) and it is absolutely calm and quite in a secluded area (and therefore isolated from the noisy streets). The villa was equipped with everything we needed. Furthermore, the owner - Simona - was very friendly and gave us very helpful recommendations + always available! I absolutely recommend the villas to other travellers coming to Bali (either for couples or families). Thank you Simona for everything! We will see you again!","I stayed at Bali Mynah for 9 days and it was amazing. The management and the staff are so friendly and have a great sense for hospitality. Everything is super clean and very well maintained. Such a peaceful and calm environment. Also, the location is very good. Only a short scooter ride through lush green hills to all the main surfing beaches, good restaurants and others places. Highly recommended!","Simply...a paradise!!
Comfortable place, relaxing, clean, silent.
Also the restaurant is great.
The position is barycentric for the south Bali: you can rent a motorbike and to move everywhere."

Being guests at the Renaissance, we wanted to have a taste of Balinese cuisine. I've never had babi guling before and wanted to try it out before visiting the warungs.

We ordered the babi guling set to share, they came with rice, soup, vegetables and some sambal. My my, it was so good, they had a selection of pork, the roast pork was so smoky and flavourful, followed by the pork satay and the pork sausage. You really got to savour different kinds of pork dishes.

What I liked as well was that they gave you some crackers as appetizers and they made fresh sambal on the table for you. Such a nice touch. It's definitely worth a visit even if you're not staying in the hotel.

PS - came here three times. So adding some additional pics. The fried rice is quite nice, and the pork in soy sauce was also really nice. Totally worth it coming back.","You have to go here for their buffet! If you're interested in trying authentic and delicious food made by locals, this is your go to! The spread was small, but I thought this was strategic because it gave you the opportunity to try everything without feeling like you missed out. It's the perfect concept and the food was to die for. The chefs lamb skewers were delicious. I highly recommend if you're ever near the renaissance and looking for a delicious meal. The views are lovely too!","Very cool upmarket Indonesian restaurant. Had a whole batik weaving loom theme which was very cool. Food was great - loved the beef rendang, the lamb curry, the spicy chicken. All very tasty. Would recommend for beginners looking to go local.","This restaurant is located within Renaissance Bali Uluwatu Resort. Love the vibes of the hotel and also the restaurant. From the time you enter the restaurant, you‚Äôll receive the full attention of the staff who are extremely friendly. There was a live band when we had our dinner on a Sunday evening. They had a seafood buffet but we decided to go for the ala-carte and ordered a variety of items to share between the 2 of us. We didn‚Äôt anticipate that the portion size would be huge hence we over-ordered. All the items were super delish, with special shout out to the babi guling and lamb skewers. They also served a starter of keropok with a delicious sambal that they pound infront of you at the table. The nice staff even asked if we would like a refill. On top of that, there was a welcome drink with a spicy kick, as well as a small chicken skewer on the house. Price point is high but I would definitely recommend this place to friends.","The most beautiful experience we had in Uluwatu!

Couldn‚Äôt recommend more and can‚Äôt wait to go back! So much better than anything else in this area","A hidden gem in Balangan! This fabulous homestay is run by a lovely family. Really enjoyed my stay there. If you're looking for a quiet, clean and well equipped place to stay in a non-tourist area: that's the one."

Also the staffs are very helpful.","Great excellent and attentive staff. Wonderful pool; plenty of space to relax and enjoy the area. Exceptional views. This villa does need to be taken care of better. Maybe fix the peeling paint and water damage in the master room. This place would be five stars if some basic maintenance and upkeep where performed. I would have given 3 stars, but the staff made our stay truly enjoyable","Had a great time, fantastic views. 4 Lovely villas all with canopy beds and 2 with giant spas and outdoor showers. Lovely friendly helpful staff we had a great time. Made the supervisor and the boys cooked us a seafood bbq feast on our last night that was amazing. Nothing is perfect so don't expect perfect, but this was pretty close to it.","One place with the world big art ,only at @puribalanganvilla good vwie and good place.","amazing, owesome place..... beautiful view"

From the moment you book, through check in and departure you are treated like family. The owner Daniel and his wonderful staff ensure you have a truly relaxing and memorable stay. The resort is in a quiet residential area with a couple of restaurants within walking distance however the nearest supermarket/shops/beaches are around 2kms away so either hire a scooter like we did (the roads around the resort are very very quiet) or hire yourself a driver         (Daniel arranged Wayan to drive us the first few days and he was fantastic and reasonably priced). We have never ridden a scooter around Bali before so were extremely nervous but as the roads were so quiet it was a bonus added adventure. Highly recommend this resort and look forward to returning","Small but intimate resort in a beautiful part of Bali, well located for airport.
Daniel is a fantastic host, and he, along with  his 3 lovely staff, really made our stay very special. Rooms very clean, comfortable and well laid out. Would highly recommend.",We had just heard of Resort Gecko when Agoda messed up our bookings for the last time. But little did we realise they had done us a favour and we found this little gem. Set away in the burbs of Jimbaran and not far from Balang beach is Resort Gecko Bali just 5 little villas with a common pool and naturist to boot. Our stay here was fantastic our only problem was that it couldn‚Äôt have been Longer. Thank you Daniel and your beautiful staff for making our stay with you a dream,,

I‚Äôm in love with place, room, staff, owners. Rima and Bayu is my family for 100%. I can say a lot of words but it will be too long novel. With this place my 1st Bali story start and finish. See you on the next chapter.","Avoid it during the next 2 years! A large construction site is just 2 m away. Dust, noise till 23 30. Trucks with construction waste. The road is completely blocked and ruined.","Love this place! Can‚Äôt say enough positive things about it. I‚Äôve already visited twice and will definitely return again. Nina, the manager is amazing and I believe one of the biggest reasons why this place runs so smoothly and why all the staff are si kind and attentive; they seem to really respect her, as do I.
Not only is it beautiful and wonderfully decorated with wonderful staff that go above and beyond but what makes this place extra special is that all is located on site so there‚Äôs really no need to leave if you don‚Äôt want to. It‚Äôs the perfect relaxing get away from the hectic traffic and noise that can be nearby areas in Bali.
I ate at both the restaraunt and smoothie shop, had wonderful spa experiences and lounged most of the rest of day at the pool (and caught amazing sunsets from the terrace and pool as well). This place is a great value for all it offers and I HIGHLY recommend it!

The second time I came back, to celebrate my friends Birthday, from decorating the bed to the dessert plates‚Äîthey added extra touches all weekend to make him feel special‚Äîthank you!

PLEASE NOTE, the hotel and all else on site is cash only.
While it is a bit farther away from the beach, like I said, we were quite happy staying on the complex for the majority of our stay. Should you wish to explore, you can inexpensively rent scooters on site for your use whilst there.",Had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday here!  The manager Nona went out of her way to give us an exceptional experience.  Her attention to detail did not go unnoticed and the same can be said for all of her staff.,Came here for an organised yoga retreat and we were all very well looked after. The rooms were stunning and so was the spa. Beautiful and friendly staff and always helpful. The location is heavenly with stunning views all around. The only thing I'd say is the yoga mats were not clean so bring your own if you're planning on doing yoga.
