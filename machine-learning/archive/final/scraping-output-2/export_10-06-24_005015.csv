* One staff member that did not serve us, stole the generous tip we left on the table for our server. She was looking around if anyone saw that. Disgraceful.",Everything is great! and the foods are amazing .... The staffs are friendly.. I really love this place ü•∞,"First of all, food tasted decent and priced very reasonably ‚ù§Ô∏è. However, please pay more attention to your wooden trays that you use to serve the Taco. It was quite greasy and felt unsanitary.

Second, be careful ordering the drink that they named Mojito because it's not like any other Mojito that I have had in other restaurants. The Mojito that we ordered was the one that was sold in ""pitcher"" that are available in 500ml and 1000ml sizes (I ordered the smaller one). When it arrived, it's served in a bottle with shot glass. My oh my, it was quite strong for my husband's palate. He said that it tasted more like arak with barely noticeable hint of lime. Like I said it was not like the Mojito you'll have in other restaurants. No sprig of mints, no lime, no ice, no club soda. Just straight arak and lime. I'd rated the mojito 4 out of 10. Also, please taste your iced tea before serving it to your guests. Was it supposed to taste that way? It tasted like it was steeped for too long and then left in a room temp for 2 days before serving.

Third, the service was quite good although not remarkably fast (understandable because when I was there, all indoor tables seems to be occupied).

We were initially sat on the bean bag out front near the street. It has pleasant atmosphere and quite nice landscaping. However, due to sudden rain, we were moving to the non-smoking area that is located at the back of the restaurant. It was quite small, but equipped with Air Conditioning. If you bring small child, it's better to have your dinner there because the outdoor sitting area can be wild of cigs' smoke.

Overall, quite enjoyed the place, I'll come back whenever I'm in the area. Oh, they also have a live music performance when I was there. The musician allowed the guess to request song and also sing with them. Awesome!

Thanks for the experience! Keep it up or improve it if possible. ‚ù§Ô∏è","I have to change this review as the last 3 times the food was very bad.
Hopefully this will improve so we can come back.

In 2021 the review was:
Nice cafe/restaurant with good food, friendly staff and nice atmosphere.
Good place for diner or drink.
Life music and Singaraja beer makes a nice evening."

Very highly recommended!","My experience in Sumi's place was very good. I stayed there for four days. The room was clean y comfortable and I felt very well after being in terrible rooms in Ubud. Sumi and family are so kind, always trying to serve you with what you need. There are coffee shops, local restaurants, laundry, petrol and ATM around. So even now being centric, it's not a bad area at all. You can also rent a motorbike. It's perfect for low budgets. And the dogs are so friendly!","Really nice, simple, clean room.

I recently had the pleasure of exploring Bali with Chandra as my taxi driver, and the entire journey exceeded my expectations. Chandra was not only punctual but also remarkably courteous, making the trip incredibly enjoyable. Their extensive knowledge of the city allowed us to navigate through traffic seamlessly.

The vehicle was not only clean but also well-maintained, providing a comfortable and safe ride. Chandra's commitment to ensuring a smooth journey truly stood out.

I wholeheartedly recommend Bali 21 Tours to anyone seeking a reliable and exceptional transportation experience in Bali.","Really appreciate Candra. His hospitality is very warm and car was really clean.
Felt comfortable from the start and end of our journey.

Will definitely book again.

Thanks Candra!","Positive- Chandra cabs were good and he gave me the price what he has promised and also with timings 10-12 hrs. He gave us good reasonable price for boat trip to and fro to nusa penida when compared to others. Also the driver in nusa penida was taking us good photographs.

To be changed - One driver was not able to catch up English easily, it took us some time to understand. Other two drivers spoke good English. Also I feel the drivers who picks up should explain us each places, culture ‚Ä¶etc,  while we are driving that would be much helpful for customers.","In short, Candra made our bali trip so memorable. Before our arrival to Bali, I shared our requirements and he helped us to prepare an itinerary. He listens to their customers and adapts as per their needs.

He is also an amazing photographer to capture moments that can be cherished forever. He is always on time on to be precise, 10-15min earlier than the plan.

His attention to details, memory have stunned me. Once I liked his status story and commented on it. A month later, he remembered and took us to the exact same place even though it was not in our itinerary.

Candra is someone who will give experiences to cherish and beyond looking tourists from commercial angle.
He knows in and out of bali and very well connected locally to provide the best deals as well.

100% recommend for anyone to have a memorable trip in Bali.","Learnt of Bali CAB and Candra from a friend who had used his services. My parents visited Bali and we contacted Candra just a day before their arrival, he was prompt and quick to respond and provided an age appropriate itinerary and a driver to take them around. They thoroughly enjoyed their visit and we highly recommend using CANDRA‚Äôs end to end services from airport pickup, sightseeing across Bali, local food and places recommendations and drop back to the airport."
