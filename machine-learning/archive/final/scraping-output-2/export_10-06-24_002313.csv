Putri and her family are so accomodating. Inviting me into their home and their lifestyle. Exploring Sidemen with Putri was something I‚Äôll always cherish and remember. Learning about the culture and food. Room is cosy and calm. Sidemen itself is a beautiful village, tucked away in the mountains. Views are breathtaking, food is amazing & jewellery making is an exciting activity to do.","Amazing place in the mountain side. Good base if you want to visit Mt Agung. Putri the owner is amazing, traditional vibes, laid back and peaceful. It's one room and a bathroom (hot water available in the shower). Will be back..","3 nights i stayed at this gorgeous place in this gorgeous town. The House market has 2 nice rooms in a amazing garden full of colours. There is a lot of peace. The house market is in the main street of Sideman where you can go to the market or see the weaving experience. At the place it self you can rent a scooter, do a cooking class and enjoy the sweet breakfast. Its also close to the nature so you can take a gorgeous walk if you want to and eat some balinese meals at the amazing nearby warungs! The people are really sweet and i had the best shower in times. I definitely recommend staying here :)","Amazing 2-room homestay run by the friendly and helpful Putri. Located next to the Sidemen local market. Quiet and peaceful. Great clean room, hot shower and very nice breakfast and the cool breezy climate makes this place just perfect. Recommended!","If you are looking for solitude, nature and/or an authentic Balinese stay, look no further!
The owners, Putri and her husband, were very accommodating and made me feel right at home. They picked me up in Ubud, helped me rent a motorbike, gave me a tour of the rice fields, brought me to Agung River, and taught me how to make offerings.
The room was simple and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the garden view was so serene.
Cannot recommend this place enough! -especially solo-travelers"
