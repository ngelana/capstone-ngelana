The longer drive was worth it, the drivers Sumberkima booked for us were lovely. Its definitely recommended to stay a week if you can. We really settled into the slower pace, we stayed in Villa Alila that was very private and a short walk to everything. Both restaurants had beautiful views and staff were always so friendly. Highly recommend doing a kayak trip that and the sauna and ice bath were my highlight. Will definitely come back!","It was so amazing we immediately planned to have our wedding there.  Since then multiple friends of ours have gone and loved it and in 2025 we are booking a large chunk of it out to celebrate our wedding there with friends and family.

Such a great experience.","The most beautiful place we ever stayed in!
The view is stunning, the staff is super friendly, the food is delicious and we also love the fact that they focus on reforestation and restoring the coral.
We stayed at villa Jahe, loved everything about it!","Wonderful stay! We stayed at Kasembi 2 with an amazing view at the coastline. Really well maintained lodge. Very very friendly people here woning at the resort. Pools were astonishing, great food at both restaurants, it has everything you need. Would love to come again some day ‚ù§Ô∏è","There are two restaurants on-site, both serving delicious food, with exceptionally friendly service. The rooms are impeccably clean, and in addition to the private pool at our villa, there are also two public pools offering breathtaking views. The atmosphere is serene, making it the ideal destination to escape to in West Bali."

It‚Äôs located in the northern part of Bali which means it is super relaxing and surrounded by beautiful nature. The villas are beautiful and perfect for a romantic getaway.
I also recommend taking a Balinese massage at the resort - the best I‚Äôve ever had.","Had the best stay here! Been to bali 15 times now and this place is the best I've stayed, the room is perfect! They put ear plugs in the bathroom so you can't hear the mosque at night even though it's so far away anyway, the restaurant is so peaceful, we were the only ones up there most of the time as there's only 6 rooms at this resort and the staff are so friendly and helpful! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Well be staying again for sure üëå","We stayed at this hotel on Nyepi.  A very beautiful and calm place.  Large and clean room, equipped kitchen and all necessary utensils.  Just a gorgeous view from the room.  There is a restaurant on site with a good menu and quite tasty food.  There are discounts for hotel guests in the restaurant, which is very nice.  There is also a spa and small gym.  Responsive and very punctual staff: we ordered breakfast to our room by the pool and visited the spa.  Everything was clear and on time.  Highly recommend!",Sumberkima Resort is awesome. Its perfect for couples. The service was friendly and highclass. The villa with own pool was spectacular. Thanks to the  team - we enjoyed it very much. Terima kasih,"Definitely had a GREAT stay here. We were beyond satisfied during our stay and nothing to complain. Special thanks to Mbok Sulung (Reception) and Pak Wayan that helps us a lot during our stay. The F&B team also amazed us with a really good and comforting dinner and breakfast. The night light view from the restaurant is MAGNIFICENT! The cocktails can‚Äôt be skipped. The room feels like home and the view was INCREDIBLE! Last but not least the hospitality is A+. Thank you very much to all Sumberkima Resort‚Äôs team!

We have no reason to not coming back here‚ô•Ô∏è"

The service is friendly and the prices are reasonable considering how remote it is. Espresso-based coffees are delicious. The menu is varied and fresh. The view is incredible! Highly recommend trying their homemade sourdough.,"Stunning views of the ocean and surroundings. Excellent retreat for spa, rest, and relaxed staff taking care of you. Nice restaurants, good food. Beautiful kayak and snorkling trip.","We spent three days having breakfast and dinner here because it was so good. Breakfast is not the usual hip a√ßai one you find on the island, it's better: sourdough bread, home made peanut butter etc. And dinner is exquisite as well.",Really love the view and the wide options of food available. Lots of options available for vegetarians and vegans. All the food are extremely healthy. Get into the restaurant by 7am (they open at 7am) and take the table furthest away from the entrance and enjoy the lovely sunrise view while having your breakfast.,"The view here is awesome, but the dishes and drinks were more misses than hits.

Drinks: We enjoyed the ginger beer and mule squash. The cocktails - such as the berry margarita - were bad, tasting like a healthy attempt gone wrong. Full Power wasn‚Äôt well blended and the taste wasn‚Äôt balanced either.

Dishes: The morning scramble was ok. I had the tofu version and my husband had the egg version. The nasi and mie goreng were ok. The moringa pancakes were like underbaked bread dough instead of fluffy, and the coconut yogurt pairing was weird for me. I‚Äôm guessing vegans will be pleased to have variety here though. The chips in the fish and chips were good, and the coconut curry chicken was decent. The baked cashews weren‚Äôt fully baked through, and still soft in bits. The risotto and French toast are best avoided.

I‚Äôd recommend going to Mangroove Cafe (a shuttle ride away) and Senja instead, unless you‚Äôre here for the views."

It was very quiet in low season and we had the whole place to ourselves, but it was still fully staffed and fully operational. The service is incredible, especially from the amazing waiter, Widiama, the food is fresh and delicious, and the views are stunning. They have a huge menu with Indonesian, Asian, and western food, including pizza, pub food, and vegan options. It is a perfect place for 2 for 1 happy hour cocktails with views high up over the valley to the beach and watching the sunset over Java! If you are staying at the Sumberkima Hill Villas, take the short walk over to give it a try!",I am very pleased with my experience at Kima Bar & Resto. Their food is truly delicious with an interesting variety of menu options. The very friendly service and pleasant atmosphere made my visit even more memorable. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a special culinary experience! Absolutely worth it!,"Kima Bar & Restaurant is an absolute gem nestled in the hills, offering a dining experience like no other. The breathtaking 360-degree views of majestic mountains and the sparkling sea create an unparalleled backdrop for a memorable meal. From the moment you arrive, you‚Äôre greeted with warmth and hospitality that sets the tone for an unforgettable experience. Me and my husband want to celebrate our 7 anniversary here again. üòç","Around West Bali, it isnt easy to find quality meals with a variety of choices. But Kima Resort is one of the few that stands out amongst my go to places for food. The Phad Thai and Chicken Wrap i had was absolutely delicious. Throw in good service in there, and that‚Äôs a 5 stars for this restaurant.",The food and the vibe was outstanding. Nice to hang out at the pool and have some food and drink. Thanks Wheaty and the crew here for excellent service.
