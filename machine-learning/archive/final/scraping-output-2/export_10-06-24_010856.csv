The treehouses are really cool and a unique place to stay. The owner is such a nice guy- cooks good breakfast and dinner included in price. He even helped us get a motorbike delivered at a good price (a car or bike is necessary). He wasn‚Äôt intrusive but was available and helpful when we needed him. Even showed us which tree houses where best for watching the sunrise and sunsets. Definitely stay here if you get the chance!,"The place is really amazing! The view is incredible, in the evening we had a bonfire, nice dinner and breakfast included, the zipline is also great and staff amazing! Only small thing was, we had ants in our bed, which is understandable in a treehouse, but it would be enough to clean the blankets before. But overall great experience!","Loved this place! It really has a nice surrounding on the top of the hill, you can see the Agung, sea, sunrise or sunset depending where your balcony looks at. The zip-line was an awesome experience, total surprise for us :) the small house is very very basic, don't expect any fancy things, but the matress was comfortable, shared bathroom was clean. Staff super nice and helpful, recommend it!","We've arrived here after a very tiring and frustrating day (flat tire, almost no time for the beach) and the lovely atmosphere & hospitality of the owner just turned it all around. His attitude is something everyone in he tourism industry should follow!
He place is simple but you can feel the love and hard work been put into it. Totally recommend if you like being close to nature and want value for money! The cableway is just the cherry on top ^^","Very very good experience! Awesome view , very very nice people , feels like back to nature , nice dinner and breakfast, the fire  was really really nice , wonderful night ever !! We rant motorcycle try to get there , but the road are too new , difficult to drive , but they come to pick us up , the nice people I had never meet, stay only one day , but we spend whole day on the tree house , really glad I find this tree house , feels like live in the dream ! And I tell them is my boyfriends birthday, they made a very lovely cake for him at the morning, very very nice people ~~~~~~~ I love this tree house !! I will always remember here !!"

We had booked and paid online using Agoda for 3 nights, but when we arrived there was no owner/manager/reception - only the mother of the owner. We showed her the booking and payment confirmation, and she told us she only accepted cash payments and that they had stopped working with Agoda. It was not possible to get a refund online, but they insisted on being paid cash. When we asked if the owner would be willing to contact Agoda to sort the issue (since we had already paid and weren‚Äôt able to get a refund), the woman showed no interest and sent us on our way. We either had to pay double, or lose our money and find another place. Really unfriendly lady and very unprofessional place. A big shame since the bungalows looked lovely - and were all empty- so we were shocked they refused to give us a place, or even somewhere to put our bags, until we could resolve the problem. She did not want to lift a fingertip to help us out.","Horribly organised. Looks nice but upon arrival I could not enter the room I had payed for despite it being empty. The lady (that was apperently the mother of the owner) wanted cash, and didn‚Äôt want to discuss anything else. I said I wanted my money back and asked if they could cancel my booking and then she literally biked away on her scooter.",it was amazing place,,

A little hard to find, but totally worth it once you do. Just go up Pettingian road, and there is a little parking lot on the right that says Rumah Pohon. That means treehouse, which I didn't know, so I drove by it twice trying to find the place. Then walk down a little dirt trail about a hundred meters to a little village of treehouses! You get your own little treehouse bungalow in the sky with breakfast and dinner included. Best deal you'll find on the island. Like I said it's a little remote , but that means it's quiet, and you're high up so no mosquitos and a lovely cross breeze. Epic visws of the whole north coast of the island and a sunset and sunrise view from either side of the ridge. Just great, I can't recommend it enough. A lovely place to get away from all the tourtouriats and traffic of Nusa Penida. Bring a crew and take this place over!",,,,
