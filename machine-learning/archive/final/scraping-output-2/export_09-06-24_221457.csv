Accommodation is very stylish, clean and peaceful. The owner Ibu and her husband were very kind, they cooked for us tasty local dishes, offered us fresh fruits from their garden, organized massages at the property and introduced us to Bali culture. We stayed only for couple of days but it felt like vacation at grandma's. Thank you Ibu for this amazing experience and wish you all the best.","We stayed for two nights at Kubu Reod. Immediately you feel a part of the family. Ibu gives you a warm, motherlike feeling as well for Fajar. They try the best for you to give you all you need. The Villas are clean and beautifully made up from recovered woods. It's located in a very peaceful place in the middle of the green. The pool is lovely as well for the food. Unfortunately there is not much option for renting a motorbike accept for Fajar's own.
We had a fantastic stay here and they can give you a lot of practical advice for activities. We however experienced nature's best by Canyoning @canyoningbali.","We had a great stay there! The place is magical, preserved, clean and authentic and the dishes Ibu prepared made this experience even more lovely. Ibu is a beautiful person always looking to satisfay our wishes and to introduce us to her univers, to her family.
We really recommend this place!","The best place to stay in the whole Bali! Ibu is the loveliest hostess and human being. she will treat you like family, cook yummy dinners and make you banana-coconut pancakes for breakfast and red rice-cinnamon tea ‚ù§
Good place to stay of you want to see the real balinese countryside and go waterfall chasing.
Hope to return one day soon!","This lovely homestay features two beautiful rustic villas, tucked away from the crowded areas. We had the chance to stay in both of them and each villa has a unique design. The highlight is the outdoor bathroom. I loved it!
The pancakes for breakfast were delicious.
It is located in the middle of the rice fields and it's close to the popular waterfalls Aling-Aling and Git-Git.
You will need a scooter to move around but if you don't want to drive one they can arrange a tour with private driver.
Unfortunately, during our stay we cannot use the pool as it was under mantainence. Also the prices for the food were a bit expensive compared to the city. We choose to eat in the city because of this.
Ibu and her family are very friendly and helpful. Thank you for the great hospitality!"
