Quite place with no visitors. U can swim here, not dangerous and not a difficult walk, you will reach here with just 5min of climbing down the stairs.
Recommended to travel here in bike so that u need not walk too far.","Grojogan Twin Waterfall offers a serene escape in a tranquil setting. Nestled in a quiet area, the waterfall provides a peaceful ambiance, perfect for relaxation and contemplation of nature. While I don't recommend swimming due to potential safety concerns, the site offers an excellent opportunity to enjoy the refreshing ionized air.","Beautiful environment but it's full of trash. Locals don't care and don't clean up.

My advice to the local banjar: ask foreigners to pay a small fee to access the Waterfall and get it cleaned up.","the road to get there is a lot of small rocks so you have to be careful and unfortunately there's a lot of trash, hopefully this waterfall can be maintained for the future, entry is currently free and don't forget to bring drinking water because there are no warung and the location of the waterfall is close  with a parking area but the place is very small, you can only use a motorbike","Waterfall would be nice if it didn‚Äôt serve as garbage dump. Plastic bottles and dead dog caught in the main pool, all trees around ‚Äúdecorated‚Äù with trash. Rather sad view :/"

If you enjoy the quiet and relax place instead of busy Canggu town, this is the best choice.
We enjoyed it so much so we extend our stay here.
The room and bathroom are hung and so clean as well.

Exceptional attention to detail is evident in the beautiful gardens, thoughtfully decorated villas & the lovely breakfast. Staff are professional, thoughtful, generous & fun. It was nice to be away from the busy areas, we saw very few tourists during our stay. Apple Villa is a hidden gem, highly recommended. We wish we were staying longer.","We are very happy to have stayed here. The staff was very friendly and polite. The breakfast was delicious especially healthy breakfast in the restaurant, the morning view was beautiful. Spacious and tidy room with comfortable bed and pillows. Complete toiletries (shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush and toothpaste, shower cap, cotton buds, razor, comb). Hot water, TV, Wifi and AC function properly. The cupboard in the bathroom was good and clean. The sofa in the room and chairs outside were pleasant for sitting. The atmosphere at night was calm, quiet, and safe. They also have security on duty. The gardens were well maintained. Large parking area. The Balinese massages was nice in clean, soothing and comfortable place near the river and also good price. Dinner was also nice at a restaurant beside the resort entrance, the foods are delicious and good price. The most memorable thing was when my husband had his birthday, the staff made special bed decoration and prepared mini birthday cake for free. Our room was also upgraded from Strawberry to Villa Lotus. Excellent hospitality.",Great resort with affordable price.,beautiful and quiet places to stay!
