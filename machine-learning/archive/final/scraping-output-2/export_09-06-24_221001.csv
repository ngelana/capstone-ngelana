The place is not too big and there‚Äôs no AC in the warung, so please expect the hotness cause Singaraja doesn‚Äôt play with its sunny weather.

Their nasi campur is really good, every bit of the protein tasted clean and savory or sweet. The price is also not expensive at all for the portion. I also tried their rawon, it‚Äôs good but not really my taste. The spices are different to what Rawon usually taste like.

Overall, a must try warung when you‚Äôre in Singaraja.","So in love with the food, very simple but tasty.

Nestled along the serene harbor, it boasts vibrant markets, where local artisans showcase their craftsmanship. The picturesque waterfront invites visitors to savor fresh seafood while enjoying panoramic views. The area's rich maritime history is reflected in its museums and historic sites. From colorful boats to lively street performances, the Harbour Tourist Area provides a delightful experience for those seeking a taste of local life amidst a stunning coastal backdrop.","Its ine of nice place you must visit when you come to north part of Bali, Singaraja. This place full of memories. I remember this place when I was child. Its always crowded, full of boat, fisherman, snack counter etc etc. Now the current government renovate and make this harbour even more beautiful. Nice place to spend time with families. Beautiful sunset. Lots of place and cafe to have lunch/ dinner. The surrounding just beautiful.
Saw lots of families came here and took the children play on the beach or just go to mini carrousel. There is also Buddhist temple so good place to visit and pray.
My friend really love this place. It just beautiful, calm and relaxing place to meet people.","A historical place for the Balinese people, especially the Singaraja people as an international port during the colonial era. Of course, I long to see the relic but the museum is closed. More visitors come on holidays and weekends but the museum is closed. This place needs to be improved more, the beaches are still dirty and there is a lot of rubbish while many local people swim.","It's a good place to relax with you friends and family or just having some ""me time"", you can sit at the beachside and enjoy the view, or you can buy food at the food court in the pasar senggol area.

Sadly, this place in overall lacks the lighting, so that if you want to enjoy eating food and drinking your beverages at night, you must hold your phone out with the flashlight on.

There is also several beggars (most are not annoying to me), but this one particular beggar is really annoying because he just beg for money (I'm pretty sure he use that money for buying cigarette). When you don't give him any money, he will be mad and threaten you by saying gibberish that I've never really understood. One time he came to multiple visitors for more than once (and he came to me like 6 times), and threatened them. When this beggar happened to threatened me and my companion while we just chatting, we threaten to call the Satpol PP on him and he just left. This goes on for a while until he left because of how small amount of money he can only get that night.

Overall, this place offer great view with foods and beverages available. Yet, sadly the facilities are lacking (not to mention that one sink near the monument is broken), with several beggars that may or may not annoy you.

Oh yeah ticket for the motorcycle is Rp.2.000 (you pay for parking ticket at the entrance), yet inside at the parking space it says Rp.1.000, so... idk. I don't know the fee (or parking ticket price) for car."

I neither dislike it, it's just okay. The price range from IDR 5k up to 100k++ (for package). The place (with 3 others) is floating above the beach, which looks interesting. I like the ambience, the view of the beach on the northern accompanied with the sound of the waves, and the lights were so romantic at night.
If you visit Singaraja city, try to spot this area, in Ex-Buleleng Harbour.","A Hidden Gem on the Bali Sea!

I have had the pleasure of visiting Singaraja on numerous occasions, and as a westerner, I have had issues with the tradition cuisine as my palate can‚Äôt tolerate the level of heat and the lack of greens. I recently stumbled upon a hidden gem that completely exceeded my expectations. Tucked away atop a pier overlooking the Bali sea, Royal Sunset Resto turned out to be an extraordinary surprise. It was so impressive, I dined a second time a day later.

The serene atmosphere, with the sound of gentle waves and the refreshing sea breeze, creates an idyllic setting that immediately transports you to a place of tranquility.
Contrary to the traditional warung scene in Singaraja, Royal Sunset Resto offers a fresh version that celebrates the local products. The culinary offerings here are an absolute delight for the palate. The menu showcases traditional fare along with some western staples. I recommend to try the traditional cuisine offered, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Oh, and don‚Äôt worry, they will temper the heat to your tolerance!

From the moment the dishes arrived at the table, it was evident that Royal Sunset Resto takes immense pride in their culinary creations. Each plate took me on a culinary journey of Bali. The freshness of the ingredients was evident the minute the dishes came out. Fish that was caught that morning. Vegetable sourced at the morning‚Äôs local market before dawn. The combination with the talent in the kitchen was perfection.

Dishes that celebrates the rich tapestry of Balinese cuisine that are a must when dining at Royal Sunset Resto are as follows:

* Paket Ikan Bakar  (special of the house)
* Pepes Ikan (grilled fish wrapped in banana leaf)
* Cah kangkung (morning glory)
* Udang Krispi (fried prawns)
* Perkedel Jagung (corn fritters)
* Cumi krispy (freshly prepared not frozen calamari)

Apart from the extraordinary culinary experience, the service at Royal Restaurant deserves a special mention. The staff members were attentive, courteous, and genuinely passionate about ensuring a memorable dining experience for every guest. Their knowledge of the menu and recommendations were invaluable in making our visit truly exceptional.

If you find yourself in Singaraja, don't miss the opportunity to indulge in the culinary wonders of Royal Restaurant. It offers a refreshing departure from the traditional local warungs, providing a unique and elevated dining experience. The breathtaking location, delectable cuisine, and impeccable service make it a true gem on the Bali Sea. Royal Restaurant has certainly left an indelible mark on my culinary journey, and I cannot recommend it enough for those seeking a memorable and delightful dining experience. For those who may wonder how much this experience may cost? The image I have uploaded of the dishes on the table cost US$35/IDR35K including beverages & beer. Mind Blowing!!

To the owner: if I could be so bold to recommend having images of local Balinese life on the wall rather than the inspirational quotes. As a diner, if I don‚Äôt get the view of the sea and have to look at the wall, it would be much more pleasant.",Nice place on the water. Good food for a good price. Detailed menu. Staff give very good service. Parking in front,"This warung Royal Sunset is the best warung on the beach with nice view on the the first left side.
