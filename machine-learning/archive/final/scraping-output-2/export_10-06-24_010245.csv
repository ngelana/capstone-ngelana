The cocktails and pitchers are the cheapest you will find on Bali and probably the cheapest too! Well worth going out of your way for.","An unique food with clean place, the price is reasonable.

The sheet has stain and they said it can not be cleanned. But the room smells nice.
The sink is already has a rust, but clean.
The toilet is nearly clean, but if you are a freak of cleaness like me it's still acceptable.","I booked a room this afternoon for my husband's friend and already paid.
But this evening when his friend would like to check in,there is no receptionists there. He already wait till 30 minutes and now he goes to another hotel without refund in this hotel..","The place could be used for stay the night, but didn't have a good view. So this place was good enough only for stay the night because this was a budget hotel. The room was small especially the bathroom. This place only have 8 rooms and didn't have pool","IT'S A LEMON:  I booked this accommodation via the internet as I was doing business for a day and thought it would be convenient. It is located on the North side of Denpasar. Not a hotel, 6 rooms in a local ""village"" type area. Staff hardly spoke english and I had to ask my taxi driver to talk with them. No facilities, as in restaurants, not even a warung nearby. I paid them 100,000 Rp but they reported me as a no show. I stayed in Kuta. Wasted money and time!!!!!!",I would advise to stay clear of this hotel! We stayed here because we had family staying at our home for the wedding and the hotel was in-between the church and home. We were robbed during our wedding on the only occasion the room was cleaned while we stayed there. We met the owners who said don't involve the police and we would be refunded for the stolen goods and the thief investigated but when we checked out the thief was still there to greet us and we were told no refund. The hotel itself is quite nice but the WiFi was shocking even for Bali standards (Think 1990's dial up) We were told we would have international channels on the TV but even the local channels didn't play. I have stayed in many hotels around Bali and the world and have never been robbed before. I would advise choosing a different hotel around Denpasar unless you enjoy poor service and like your belongings taken!
