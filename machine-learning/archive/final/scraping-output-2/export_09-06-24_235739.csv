ChIJYX9f2DAZ0i0RxC3NMjR_g_I,Pemulan Bali Coffee Plantation(FREE TASTING),-8.4016836,115.3251017,"Jl. Raya Kintamani No.16, Manukaya, Kec. Tampaksiring, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80552, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17474950841294990788,OPERATIONAL,+62 878-4027-5883,farm,"coffee_shop, cafe, farm, food, store",4.7,810,,"Don‚Äôt missed this place. The staff and Chico  (Luwak like catüòÅ) are cute. Coffee and tea are good, like just be prepared freshly. We tried all of them and love to buy something back. Even the price maybe expensive. But when compared to staff, atmosphere, and taste, they‚Äôre priceless. Please support the local farmers. Enjoy üòä","The coffee plantation offers a complimentary tour and tasting experience, allowing visitors to explore the fascinating world of coffee production in Bali. The tour provides valuable insights into the cultivation and processing of coffee beans, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the journey from plant to cup.

During the tasting session, guests have the opportunity to sample various tea and coffee blends and flavors, immersing themselves in the rich aromas and distinct profiles of Bali. This complimentary tasting adds value to the overall experience, allowing visitors to expand their palate and appreciate the nuances of different brews.

However, one aspect of the experience that may give pause to some visitors is the pricing of the tea and coffee available for purchase. While the tour and tasting are free, the cost of buying tea and coffee products can be relatively high. Additionally, some visitors may feel skeptical about the quality of certain products, particularly those made from powdered ingredients.

For example, the powdered tea and coffee offerings may raise concerns among discerning consumers, leading to hesitation in making a purchase. This skepticism is understandable, as powdered products may not always meet the expectations of those seeking authentic and high-quality beverages.

Overall, while Pemulan Bali Coffee Plantation offers an informative and enjoyable tour experience with complimentary tastings, potential visitors should be aware of the pricing and product offerings available for purchase. While the tour itself is free and informative, the decision to buy tea and coffee products may require careful consideration based on individual preferences and expectations.","Highly suggest visiting this place for a lovely daytime activity. Gorgeous views, kind people, great tour and very enjoyable taste testing experience! Really, we loved it.

Unfortunately, because we loved it so much we bought over $100 US Dollars worth of souvenirs from their shop, coffees and teas and such. Very expensive for the area but we thought it must be so fresh and organic, we were excited to give to family and friends.

Upon returning home, I opened up my favorite lemongrass tea and found some chemically colored, detergent looking power in its place. I don‚Äôt know what this cheap, fake power tea is but DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
Unfortunately, it was the same for the coffees! All powdered instant coffee.
NOT REAL.

Wonderful spot, I just wish they were more honest about the products the sell.","Great coffee plantation experience.

The guide showed us different plants that grow in the property. Interesting to see the different varieties of coffee beans and fruits. We also saw the process of roasting and producing the coffee along with the luwak coffee.

Would highly recommend a visit",This was a real treat! Free entry and free tasting. We had a wonderful knowledgeable guide and the teas and coffee were wonderful! Got some of each to take home!

Explained the luwak coffee making process.
Tea trials. We didn't like any of the tea. Either too sweet or too plain. They have banner saying the animals are treated fair and nice here.
We bought 100gs luwak coffee for 520k. If you pay with card 3% on top. Kinda expensive
However, people says 80% of luwak coffee outside are fake so we pay a bit higher just to see the difference.

50k for a luwak coffee cup here. We ordered 2 but couldn't finish either of them.
Coffee was grounded and poured hot water on top and drink. So if you stir the cup, you will taste the grounded bean also.
Inside the place, there was a new small bali swing and hire dress. They don't let you take photos on decor if you do not pay for the swing.",Must visit place when you are in Bali. They give 12-13 flavours of coffee (inhouse plantation) to taste free of cost. The place is well maintained. All the plants were grown on their own and it was a nice place to roam around and explore their plantation fields and taste coffees with a view and shop.,"I had an amazing experience at this coffee farm store. Right at the entrance a guide took me around the gardens and explained different kinds of coffee from Bali, Robusta & Arabica as well as the teas, cacao & unique squishy slimy plants. The Luwak was napping but woke up to say hi & was told they usually get back to their pack each night & different luwak each time. The roasting process was very educational. The tea and coffee tasting was a lovely journey with a dash of knowledge learned hence I bought some teas & coffees. The view from the coffee table, the aroma of the teas & coffees being served made me nostalgic as it reminds me of my grandfather‚Äôs tea plantation. I love this place & I‚Äôll be back when I visit Ubud again.  P.S. the Luwak coffee I bought was one of the best coffee I‚Äôve grind & made at home and the teas have been giving me good sleep!!","I would recommend only for the experience of trying luwak coffee and how is it processed if you're interested.
Overall experience is not necessarily. They are so expensive if you want to buy stuff.

Swing team there is awesome

And one thing happened to me there, I bouhght a coffee to drink, and by mistake I dropped it all, and I only had one sip. The girl there didn't offer even a new cup for me or offering to give it for free, to show a good service, she made me pay for it.","The usual tourist trap;  didn't feel like antagonizing my driver so went along with it. Of course they made us feel guilty after a free sample tasting, so we purchased the cheapest possible (still horrendously expensive) sweet powdery chemical drink, more fool me :) avoid"

This was a unplanned visit (as we were under the impression, that luwak coffee is stopped). Then the driver told us about this place and took us, its a beautiful place and a nice concept of free tasting of coffee and then you get a proper walk through of the plantation, how the coffee is made the whole process and you get to taste around 20+ different coffees (for free). You only need to pay 50,000IDR if you want to taste Luwak coffee. And then you can also buy these coffee powders from there sales outlet. Great place, nice concept.",An amazing place for coffee lovers to learn about different coffee plants and the process of making coffee including civet coffee. There‚Äôs a guide per group doing all the introduction.  They were very helpful when answering our questions regarding coffee. We were given a coffee/tea paddle to try which was very impressive! Ended up buying heaps to take home with us. So glad we‚Äôve visited this place.,The flow of the tour is nice It gives you a true sense of Bali forest nature and a special experience for coffee and tea lovers,"I was absolutely appalled by the abhorrent treatment I received from a staff member at a particular establishment. The customer service was abysmal, and the staff member displayed a blatant attitude of discrimination towards Indian clients. Their lack of cooperation and clear intention to solely focus on making a sale was disgraceful.

During my visit, the staff rudely dropped samples of coffee and tea for tasting and callously left me unattended, wrongly assuming that I had no intention of making a purchase. To their astonishment, I ended up spending a significant amount of over Rp.400,000 at their shop. Despite my patronage, the staff's disrespectful behavior towards Indian customers was utterly unacceptable.

I strongly advise any fellow Indian individuals against visiting this establishment for a Balinese coffee experience. It is evident that they do not value or respect Indian clientele. The management of this establishment must prioritize showing respect to all clients, regardless of whether they make a purchase or not. It is imperative that the Ministry of Tourism in Indonesia investigates and addresses such discriminatory behavior in the service  of this establishment","Absolutely amazing experience!
Here you can walk through the garden where fruits, vegetables, herbs, and coffee grow and meet ""poo hunters"" behind luwak coffee.

Finally tried the luwak - which is mild and smooth! I expected craziness but it's pretty chill. You can also see luwak rodents in the cage. They vaccinate them and then set them free.

They have a small store where they sell the teas, coffee, chocolate and some goods that grow in the garden. Also my guide, Ayu, was very informative and helpful! Great to have a conversation with and learn about the local experience. Overall Great people and place. Highly recommend!"

We spent 3d2n serenely here, with a decent distance to both Ubud and Kintamani. As the name suggests, this place is a cabin style accomodation. There is only one cabin so you kinda own the whole place. The cabin consists of roomy bedroom equipped with kitchenette and living area (with varieties of entertainment), outdoor bathroom, and terrace. You have access to the spacious yard with lush greens, a proper gazebo, a fish pond, and a proper bbq pit. The local manager, Komang, is always so helpful - he prepares the breakfast, rented motorbike, even laundry service. During our stay, we have electrical blackout for about 2 hours - which was alright but if Kabinjin has a backup generator it will be better. The cabin location is about 10-15 away from Tampaksiring market, it gets quiet early in the evening (I'm not complaining). Overall, we are so happy with our stay. Thank you, Kabinji.","I had the pleasure of staying one night at Kabinji, a truly enchanting retreat nestled in the heart of nature, near Ubud, Bali. It's the perfect haven for those seeking relaxation, solitude, and a genuine connection with the natural world.

Kabinji offers an unparalleled sense of privacy, allowing guests to unwind and recharge in complete seclusion. The location itself is a marvel, surrounded by the lush beauty of the natural world. The moment I stepped inside, I was immersed in a world where tranquility reigns.

Komang, the local manager, stands out for his exceptional dedication to ensuring guests' comfort and well-being. He not only caters to every request but also prepares a delightful breakfast, setting the tone for a perfect day.

The owners of Kabinji have poured their hearts and souls into this remarkable sanctuary, and it shows in every aspect. The attention to detail is astonishing, from the meticulously crafted entrance gate to the serene gazebo, perfect for yoga, meditation, or simply unwinding in nature's embrace. The fireplace, the meticulously curated garden boasting a rich array of plants and flowers, and the interior design of the rooms ‚Äì each element speaks of a labor of love.

One of my most memorable experiences was tasting the local coffee, sourced from a nearby tree, and grinding the beans with the manual grinder provided. Brewing coffee with an Italian machine was a delightful touch, and it showcased Kabinji's commitment to providing a unique and personalized experience. The outdoor toilet with both a shower and bath is a hidden gem, and thoughtful touches like the bamboo toothbrush added to the charm.

As the night descended, I had the pleasure of using a projector to watch a movie and immerse myself in the melodies of excellent vinyl music.

Kabinji also serves as a great base for exploring the Kintamani area, making it an ideal escape from the hustle and bustle of Ubud. The sunrise spot nearby is simply breathtaking and offers a stunning contrast to the sometimes crowded streets of Ubud.

My only regret is that I couldn't stay longer, and I'm already yearning to return. Kabinji is more than a cabin hotel; it's an oasis of serenity, a testament to the owners' passion, and a place where nature and luxury harmoniously coexist. I can't wait to go back soon.","I stayed two nights at Kabinji and it was perfect. The included breakfast was healthy and delicious, delivered right to the cabin itself from Komang. I tried the smoothie bowl and omelette options, but they have other option too.
The studio was cleaned both days as requested. The bed is super comfortable. The days are warm in the area to explore (tirta Empul is very close and can ask to do trekking), and the hot springs of mt. Batur are 25 min scooter ride away.

I appreciate that Kabinji has a scooter for rent as it made it easy to explore the area.

The amenities were provided (bamboo toothbrush too!) soap shampoo shower gel towels, everything I needed for my stay.

I will definitely come back soon.",definitely worth the journey,
