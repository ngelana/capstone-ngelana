Lots of coffee options. Quesadillas breakfast was amazing the dragon fruit bowl was outstanding. And the experience trying the avocado koffie it is so far the best one that I had here in bali. This place deserves a 6 star","Clean and new, beautiful display of coffee machines. Staff was pleasant. Washrooms clean. Nice menu options for coffee ‚òïÔ∏è üòã
Banana coffee
Minion bowl
70F breakfast","It‚Äôs pretty convenience actually having brunch in here. Am dropping my car to wash (as it is in one area) and leave it for having brunch. The place to eat is spacious,cozy and homey environment. The food and beverages has a plenty of options with affordable price. The hospitality of the employees is remarkable. Taste of the foods also blowing my mind away.","I don‚Äôt often write reviews, but my experience here compelled me to share my thoughts.

I recently visited this place and, overall, had a pleasant experience. The atmosphere was enjoyable, and the food and beverages were satisfactory.

However, one staff member, whose name might be Dina or Dian, was notably unprofessional. She rarely smiled and seemed to be in a consistently bad mood, which detracted from the otherwise pleasant environment. For a cafe with these prices, I expect a higher level of customer service. I might think twice to come back again.","Sadly I got a bad impression, there are 2 or 3 flies around my table and that is so annoying. I love the vibes but the flies make me not impressed. Coffee just ok, pancake also ok with big portion."

Lol","I love  this non halal food , the typical food from Medan city. Roast pork with red sauce is my favorite. It‚Äôs simple place and affordable price. Parking place is easier by motorbike.","The best BPK (Babi Panggang Karo) and Sangsang in town. There are so many pork dishes in Bali, but, this one is from Karo, north Sumatra.

Staff are very friendly and helpful. The place is clean and view from the rooftop is amazing. They have nice pool as well. The road not the best but still ok. Overall, love it!","A rough and broken road about 250 meters long, there is no so-called parking lot.  The price is not proportional to the service, the swimming pool is a bit dirty and I haven't seen anyone play.  Shopping is inconvenient, of course if you want to spend more at the little shops in the alleys.I don't want to talk about it, I feel bad when I think about it",The staff are amazing here....Era and the boys were very accommodating.  The room was large very clean and comfortable and was serviced daily.  We enjoyed our breakfast from the rooftop...basic but yummy.  Era organised a scooter and we had it for 3 days...very cheap too.  Thanks Era you guys were awesome. Xx,"I went there for conference.

Our stay for 3 days and 2 nights were so lovely. We picked the room on the ground floor next to the swimming pool.

We had fun dipping at 12am!
The staff are so friendly and very polite. Definitely going to come back here.

Side note: the road to this resort is quite bumpy.","Affordable, beds are comfortable bathroom is good. We arrived in the middle of the night but it was not a problem at all for them. Not far from the airport especially when you land late at night. The driver the hotel called for us to drive us around Bali was awesome."
