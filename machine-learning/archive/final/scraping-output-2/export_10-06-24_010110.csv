ChIJb8UIyH8V0i0RZaXefe5gpKU,Hidden Mini Zoo Bali,-8.611422,115.28626539999999,"Banjar Sakih, Jl. Pandu, Guwang, Kec. Sukawati, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80582, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=11935771489868883301,OPERATIONAL,+62 815-2933-0025,zoo,"zoo, tourist_attraction",4.9,1425,,"One of the most charming and intimate zoos I've ever had the pleasure of visiting, this zoo offers a unique and heartwarming story. It all began with the owner‚Äôs passion for animals, starting as a backyard sanctuary and blossoming into a conservation effort funded through selling photographs of the well-cared-for animals. This new site caters to a growing interest from tourists while allowing the collection to expand, showcasing how a zoo can be ethically managed.

True to its name, the zoo is small and perfect for families like mine, with in-laws and two primary-aged girls. While it may not yet be widely famous, it offers an incredible, interactive experience that captivates visitors of all ages.

Though I‚Äôm no animal expert, the gentleness and calmness of the animals reflect the tender care they receive from the dedicated zookeepers. Walking through the enclosures, we encountered rare birds, free-roaming lizards, and a variety of fascinating creatures including bats, owls, hedgehogs, parrots, snakes, spiders, and scorpions. The friendly staff guide both animals and guests to create remarkable photo opportunities, all complimentary, without any hidden charges or tips expected.

If you've read this far, you're likely the kind of thoughtful tourist who would appreciate this place. Running a zoo is no easy feat, balancing ethical considerations with financial viability. I hope the owner shares more of their inspiring story in the future. This experience not only fosters a love for animals and the earth but also makes conservation a tangible and educational endeavor from the grassroots level.","Our 4 and 2 year old girls enjoyed this much more than the Bali zoo..very different kinda animals of course so don't expect to see elephants, lions etc. Instead they have birds, monkeys and a whole bunch of cool reptiles, lizards, snakes etc which you can hold and interact with. Very friendly staff and knowledgeable too. Ticket includes a free drink and souvenir (a cute bottle opener keychain). Takes about 2 hours max but worth it. Highly recommend ‚ù§Ô∏èü¶éüêçü™≤üï∑Ô∏è","We had such a wonderful time at the Hidden Zoo. When we pulled up to it I wasn't sure we were in the right place as we had to follow a path past rice feilds and then we eventually ened up at the zoo. I highly recommend this place and its amazing kids and adults if you love animals. It is a small place but wow did it leave an impression. We got to hold Spiders, Snakes, Lizards, Scorpios, Birds, Bats, Hedgehogs and even a beautiful Luwak. You could hold them.as long as you like. The animals a well looked after and if they don't want to be on you then they are not forced too. There was also a beautiful Cafe at the back of the zoo over looking some rice fields. Also when the clouds cleared we could see Mt Agung","A great little fun half day excursion. Lots of cool animals and up close encounters. Lovely restaurant at the end with nice views over local rice patties.Not sure how busy it gets - we arrived at opening time, walked right in and then had breakfast after walk through.","Not much street parking available, our driver was skilled to park where he did with assistance from their security. A short walk down towards the zoo which was nice. 200k per adult entry and a voucher for Cafe was given along with a free Souvenir (bottle opener).

Upon entering I did panic as a large monitor walked towards us at pace, I was wondering if it had escaped but it only wanted to lay in the middle of the footpath üòÖ

The exhibits could benefit from being larger and having larger pools available for the animals to bathe/drink from. I do wonder if the animals are offered any forms of enrichment. We were given what appeared to be cat food to feed both the peacocks and monkeys üò≥ not sure how biologically appropriate that is.

Staff were very friendly and made sure to offer interactions with all the animals available however they would often give you an animal and walk off to assist others üòÖ so you'd have to find them to return the animal or put it back into the enclosures/containers they had. It was a relatively short experience, perhaps about an hour? But that was perfect for us as we had lots of interactions and then left to continue our day trip. At the end there is a Cafe which we didn't go to but staff reminded us of the vouchers we were given at the start and gave us two soft drinks in exchange for the vouchers. They also had the cutest toilet I've ever seen, pebbles and planted with Anthurium üòÇ

It was nice to know our driver had an area to sit and have a coffee/smoke while we did our thing."
