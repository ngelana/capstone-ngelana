The restaurant is nicely decorated and well designed. There are normal seatings as well as  individual huts on the water which looks great. Yes they can speak English and no issues with ordering foods. The service is quick and effective. Food was prepared within short time and delicious. They have onsite toilets facilities. It is a good place for family lunch. Overall we are very happy with our visit.,Tried the mixed satay here and it was delicious. They are happy to replace one meat with another for the satay. Loved the ambience and my family tried other dishes here and they were very happy. Service was quick too. Prices are slightly on the higher side.,"Cozy and lovely place, good prices to

The food was delicious (especially the Ayam Betutu), the service was excellent and the whole place is beautiful, set around fish ponds with table in little individual thatched pods around the edge. Such good value too.",A lovely quiet restaurant which is not overrated or overly crowded. The food was lovely. The best thing was their sambal. They serve 3 types of sambal with the bebek goreng and fried fish (most of the main dishes). The tempeh & tauhu tempura was just lovely! The staff were friendly too. Enjoyed our lunch here. Beautifully landscaped. Take the time to walk around the compound!,"Food was terrible and horrible, all menus what we ordered were frozen stuffs. Also the price is quite expensive. Recommend not to order pizza or fish and chips..","The food was alright, I found it to be a bit overpriced. The dishes we ordered were decent, but nothing stood out as especially delicious. The atmosphere was nice, with a lovely view of the river, and the service was friendly.

However, given the somewhat high price point, I would have expected the food to be a bit more impressive.

I'd say Warung Tepi Tebing is an okay choice if you're in the area and looking for a place to eat, but be prepared to spend a bit more than you might expect.","This place has a very nice view of the river and camping style of dining. You definitely feel relaxed here. The food is ok, not particularly better than any other Warung, considering the price is obviously on the expensive side.

We went there because our driver recommended this place."
