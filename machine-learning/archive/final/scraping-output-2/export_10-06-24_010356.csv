Less than 2 months before, the owner informed her that she would be required to reserve a ""3 night minimum"" booking, but since the owner already had reservations on both sides, they advised her to ""move the date of her wedding"" and wouldn't honour the original reservation. We had the wedding at an even more beautiful villa nearby... there are so many great options in the same area, I would steer clear of this type of untrustworthy business owner.","BEWARE Very unprofessional and unreliable managent. The management are scammers and bullies. I was supposed to stay at this villa for a wedding that had been booked and honored years in advance through covid, this villa held the deposit for years, then weeks before the wedding they changed their terms and said they could no longer accommodate the wedding because they wanted a longer stay, but didn't have the dates available. They were bullies trying to force a date change of an international wedding last minute.  This left the bridal group scrambling to find another venue just weeks before their wedding. Luckily there are many other beautiful Villas in the area whose management isn't greedy and can be relied on to not run these types of scams. Booking with this villa is not safe, you can't trust them not to change their terms or behave professionally.

Staying at Shalimar villa is our best moments the view from the villa is really nice we can see beach from our room.this villa really big and they have big and nice swimming pool.
Special thanks for villa staff they are very  kind and Spry For to serve us
High recommend this villa especially if you are on vacation with family or group","We got married at Shalimar last month and whilst the venue is a beautiful backdrop and space for a wedding, the stay at the villa was less than ideal. There were so many things wrong with it I don‚Äôt even know where to begin, but our main issue was that the largest villa of the estate (Kalima) had no hot/running water for the entirety of our 3 night stay. We mentioned it on day one and they told us the next day it had been fixed. It had not been fixed and there was absolutely zero communication about it. We were there to get married so didn‚Äôt have time to be chasing them on everything so we just got on with it and showered in a different villa. Two of our guests staying in the smaller villa also got bed bugs (the villa denies this of course and tbh there is no way to prove either way) but the guests are regular visitors to Bali and were staying at Como Canggu either side and had no issues there. Aside from the issue of no hot/running water and bed bugs (as if that isn‚Äôt enough) we also had issues with the poor wifi connection, filthy curtains/mosquito nets, lack of staff presence and we arrived to find an enormous construction site next door that used angle grinders late into the evening. The manager claims this had been mentioned to the Booking Agent (he tends to use the booking agent to avoid accountability for a lot of things, you will also see that from other reviews on here) but it had never been communicated to us. We did lodge a formal complaint regarding all our issues with the manager once we returned home from our wedding/holiday and as mentioned above, whilst he acknowledged the hot water situation, his lack of responsibility or accountability for any other issues was quite concerning. Instead, he had an excuse for everything. I have no doubt he will respond to this review with an essay of excuses too, he is that type of person. I will say that they did offer us compensation for the water issue‚Ä¶ the compensation being a complimentary 3 night stay in the 2 bed villa, but only in low season and only in the next 12 months. Laughable. A completely empty and insignificant offer considering the huge amount of money we spent to have a functioning villa!"

Very lovely and chill atmosphere. Everyone super nice.
Always a nice experience.",Cozy pit-stop after catching wave! Just a minute walk from Lyma Beach!,One of the best Cappuccinos I've had in Bali and the staff were friendly. I look forward to visiting again on my next trip to Bali.

Really loved staying here. Super communicative host who helped organized requested transport. The area is not as busy as other parts of canggu. Beach is very close and an awesome sunset spot. A nice coffee shop under, too.

Cons: the shower head was broken and sprayed everywhere.","I stayed in the apartment for two weeks:
Pluses:
1. Nice layout of apartment
2. bright space
3. In walking distance to beach
4. Excellent and nice cleaning service

Minuses:
1. The walls are very thin so there is no soundproofing;
2. there is construction going on all around the property; so there is loud noise from early on until late, even on weekends (two companies are building new villas right in front of the lofts, which will take at least a couple of years to complete);
3. the owner (from Belgium) and the management did nothing to make sure the construction happens when they are allowed to work.
4. You can hear loud mopeds and cars all night and days as the lofts are on the busy main road to the beach.
5. Loud barking dogs kept me up all night.
6. The owner refused to give me a refund because of the noise situation (make sure you book via airbnb to have some external support)
7. The area is not nice but being destroyed by all the development (a lot of trash etc. around)
8. The management lives far away so there is nobody around if you need anything
9. The apartment and furniture is made out of cheap materials that show their wear and tear; the bathroom needs urgent update, as well as the kitchen.
10. There is a problem with the plumbing and there is a bad smell in the bathroom and kitchen
11. There is a big ants problem in the kitchen; although they sprayed several times, the many ants kept coming back
12. There is nothing in walking distance (no restaurants, supermarkets etc.); it is very isolated once their coffee shop closes early; you will need to constantly pay for taxis to get around, not a convenient location
13. Many not friendly stray dogs in the beach","Location is fine.

Too much noise around.","Stayed in Noma Vila 2 which was absolutely perfect in every way. I can't seem to add a review on that specific building but it was superb;  Amazing staff, great villa, amazing location, PERFECTLY decorated.",Super nice spot just on the outside of the busy Canggu and in walking distance from the beach

It‚Äôs our favorite small joint here around Seseh. The owners are so friendly. They made sure my dog had water and they gave her lots of love and pets. The food was absolutely delicious! We tried 5 dishes here and we loved every single one so far. You can choose your protein for every type of dish. I liked the taste of homemade Asian food, the flavor hit just right.","Elisse was on my list of restaurants to check out during a mini excursion to Seseh, and it definitely lives up to my high expectations of Chinese comfort food (as someone who's ethnically Chinese). It's a cute family business dishing up delicious home-cooking that nourishes the soul. The portions are generous, dining area is clean and air-conditioned, and everything tasted fresh. I highly recommend the stir-fried rice noodles, which were soft and tasty. I liked the simplicity of the menu and ordering was a breeze. Super friendly staff and owners, and an adorable Yorkshire Terrier, add sweet charm to this place.","I decided to finally stop by for quick lunch here and I was surprised with the experience. First of all, Bali has become absurdly touristy for the long termers like me that sometimes even water comes at cost! So big surprise is I come here greeted with AC and, a glass of cold water! I ordered black pepper rice bowl with tempeh and tofu. I was not keen about how spicy it has become but rest assured it took me back to feeling home with the Chinese flavors. I loved the home cooked feel, and the jug of icy water + the wifi is very strong - good for coworking space for afternoon break from the heat. I have huge praises for family owned businesses and this is one of them. A local family from Bandung and you can see how they work on everything together- such a refreshing way to do business.

PS they do takeout and delivery within seseh for free ‚Äî you‚Äôre welcome, just say recommended by Sandy! ;)

PPS ask for special off-the-menu Mum‚Äôs congee with chicken broth. Best ever !!

Recommended for: Chinese restaurant seseh, neighborhood coworking seseh, affordable meals seseh","Ordered the mongolian chicken rice and chose medium spicy. The food was really good and  tasted really homely.

Its hard to find spicy food around the area so if you are into spicy food, you definitely need to try this place.","I recently dined at this restaurant and tried two menu items: tacos and spring rolls. The tacos were excellent, with a perfect balance of sweet, sour, and spice. As for the spring rolls, they were the classic variety, but what made them stand out was the unique dipping sauce. I've never tasted a sauce like this anywhere in Bali, and it's definitely worth trying. I'll be returning for sure!"
