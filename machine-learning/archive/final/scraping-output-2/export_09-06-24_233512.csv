Been to quite a few waterfalls but never one when we were alone for 2 hours, not another soul in sight and one of the better scenic waterfalls, stunning and private!!! Not just a waterfall but connected to a beautiful running river! A must go before it gets more discovered!!","Very Nice waterfall If you want to enjoy a cool shaped waterfall then this one is for you. There is also a river going just pass it so good opportunities for a Nice photography üì∏

Entrance fee is 20k, and its just a two minute walk from the Main Road. The way to the waterfall is nicely made with cement. So slippers is fine here.",Beautiful natural waterfall. Entrance is 30000 IDR. We were the only ones there. They have put lots of effort in the gardens. The access road is steep and winding but doable when you take it slow.,"All the construction looked quite rundown, but maybe we visited at the wrong time. Trash in the waterfall and worn down huts. Nobody around so we had the whole place to our selfüëåüèª50.000 idr per person. Quite cheap.","I think this is te only waterfall in bali close from the ticket entrance,only 2mins walk but so sad to see the area looks really abandon"
