So, my friend, I went to this place the other day. Oh yeah, the babi guling there is decent, but not exactly amazing. I've had much tastier dishes in Ubud, to be honest. This option is just... well, mediocre, you know?

The staff seemed friendly enough, but on the other hand, they also seemed a bit indifferent, not entirely interested in making sure you have a good time. I don't know, maybe I'm too demanding, but still.

The atmosphere in the cafe was okay overall, but man, there was this clingy dog... It totally threw me off track. I was trying to enjoy my babi guling, but the dog kept coming up and distracting me. I don't know, maybe some people like that, but I don't.

In general, I wouldn't say that this place is bad, but it's not exactly super either. If it weren't for the dog and a bit more care from the staff, maybe I would recommend it. But for now, you know, it's better to look for other places in the area. Just in case.","I found my favorite balinese sausage (Urutan) and some delicious crispy pork skin, the whole taste is so so. It's affordable price to dine in with green view.","Love the place, great food, good service. üëç","Yes! Last year I went to Bali, my dad suggested us to go here and that was truly the best decision. I am in love with their nasi genyol special.
