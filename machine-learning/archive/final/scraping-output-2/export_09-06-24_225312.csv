There is a big swimming pool. Nights can be colder compared to other regions of Bali so don't be shy to ask for a second blanket. Service staff is friendly and helpful, they organized scooters for us to rent and gave advice for hiking to the waterfalls in the area. Continental breakfast and the exact number of pieces of food seems to be a secret standard among all accommodations we had in Bali, but in Puri Sunny Camp it's preparation is on the better side, the cook knows how to make a perfect fried egg.",We entered at 35k a person. Beautiful place to cool down. The pool wasn't 100 % clean but that shouldn't keep you from going. I love the locals they are so friendly but the kids were playing in the pool to a point were there were like 15 of them splashing around and playing. I think it's nice of this place to let them but at the same time it would have been really nice to enjoy our pool time in quite. But like i said still a great place.,"We had a wonderfull stay at puri sunny camping ! All the staff team is very welcoming and helpfull, the view to the rice terrasse is just Amazing, one of the best sunset in Bali. If you are looking for the authentic Bali, I highly recommand this place","We didn't stay there, but we used the pool. 35k per person. Landscape amazing, you're just between 2 rice terraces... Just unbelievable !
Place was empty except some local young men. Perfect !","Great place to get away from bustling city. The camp cottage in the middle of rice fields and mountain. But it can be improve by fixing room lock, bathroom door lock, installing better shower faucet so you can mix hot and cold water."

This was my second visit to Gangga Homestay in 2 years.  The first time I went for a week and stayed three weeks.

This time I went directly from the airport to Gangga homestay and left, after another three weeks the same way.

I have a love for diversity and local culture.  I am not so interested in the checklists that normally accompany mainstream tourism.

I want to know that I have been touched and changed by the people and culture of a place.  I want share and eat with them.  I found warmth, laughter and grace at Gangga Homestay.

Is it a five star resort?  No, but it will have everything you need.  The surrounding area is endlessly interesting.  I still have much to explore.

Feel the rhythm of real Balinese life by going to Gangga Homestay.

I noticed that most who booked just one or two nights regretted not being able to stay longer.","Best place to stay near Munduk.
Very nice location with awesome view. The family who owns the hotel is extremely kind and helpful. Food is delicious.","Gangga Homestay was such a wonderful place to stay near Munduk. The people who run the homestay couldn't be kinder, more considerate or more welcoming. The room is simple but comfortable and clean. The view is stunning, and you're surrounded by rice fields, jungle and small villages. But the best part is the home-cooked food. I think I had the best food I've had Indonesia-wide here. There's also a lovely, peaceful rooftop to chill on.

The only challenge for me is that there are very steep hills to get to the Homestay. If you're a novice scooter rider like I am, perhaps call the Homestay. They will very kindly pick you up 1km away on the main road and help you get there.","Amazing homestay experience with a lovely family far away from the crowd. Located in the valley with endless ricefields, mountain views, beautiful waterfalls this is the place to relax and enjoy nature. Magical Bali can be found there, untouched little villages and truly Balinese hospitality. The family is just so kind, welcoming and their food was so yummy. Watching them cooking, preparing homemade peanut sauce was a special moment, we will never forget. Their banana pancake was the best we've ever had! Please if you plan to go to Munduk, visit this family!","Not very comfortable rooms, but tasty food and very friendly, helpful and hospitable staff. They tried their best to do our stay as good as it could be. Keep in mind, that the road to that place is very narrow and winding. Our taxi driver from Seminyak beach was crapping into himself the whole way till the end."

So 5 stars in advance,"Amazing service and environment, and so delicious food üëåwe had Nasi Campur, spring rolls and Arak cocktail and everything was superb üòå","This restaurant is amazing.

Nice view and good food."
