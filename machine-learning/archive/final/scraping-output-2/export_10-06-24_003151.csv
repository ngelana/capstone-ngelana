The hotel's charm is undeniable‚ÄîI found myself constantly reaching for my camera to capture its breathtaking beauty.

Perfect for couples, the hotel offers a variety of activities. We enjoyed yoga classes and spa treatments, all of which were top-notch. The staff were professional, friendly, and always ready to help.

Located near rice fields, the hotel provides a peaceful escape from busy Ubud while still being close to everything. If you're in need of relaxation, Korurua Dijiwa is the place to be ‚ù§Ô∏è","Amazing place very close to the centre of Ubud. Super attentive and friendly staff. The rooms are super clean and beautiful. We definitely recommend the Wooden suite, spectacular. We loved the food in the restaurant, with a great variety of typical local food. Finally, the massages at the spa are amazing. We will come back again! ‚ù§Ô∏è","Great location in Ubud very calm and relaxing surroundings in a beautiful garden. Staff amazingly friendly & professional and ultra quick to answer all your needs. Very practical to have the shuttle to bring you to the busier center of Ubud. The restaurant at the hotel offer a very good made on the spot breakfast. Very fresh, tasty, one of the best breakfast!!. Same for lunch or dinner we enjoyed all.

The room was very charming, we were on our own wooden house. Very well decorated and very relaxing. The bed was so comfy, we slept like babies;-). All the amenities of the hotel was great, pools and I almost forgot FREE yoga class in the morning","Excellent Teamwork

A team welcoming us upon arrival. One straightaway handle our car, the other guiding me with online registration while other 2 personnel handling our luggage and bring it to the room. They‚Äôre mastering their role respectively. Demonstrating big nice smile, helpful, and truly friendly. Spacious, clean, and comfortable room with large daybed in the terrace. The villa is located about 4km from the main temple (Pura Dalem Ubud) where shops & restaurant surround. All is perfect. Love it!

Note: unfortunately I didn‚Äôt take photo since I was busy enjoying being in the room ü´∂üèª",Amazing hotel with very friendly and helpful staff always going above and beyond to make your stay perfect. Breakfast is really good and the restaurant for lunch and dinner is a great option too. Only 5 minutes scooter ride from the Ubud Palace and centre and the hotel offer a shuttle bus too frequently.

Extremely pleased with our meals there that we went back a 2nd time during our stay. Possibly the best meal we had in Ubud. Great find!,"Another good find in Ubud! The pizza dough was thin and chewy just how i like.
The tomato sauce was nice and they put just right amount of toppings. But I wish they have white pizza sauce too..","What a FIND! Absolutely awesome wood fired pizza, especially if you are Gluten Free. It was one of the BEST Gluten Free Pizzas and vegetarian/vegan options I‚Äôve ever had. They were able to put cheese on one side of our pizza (as I‚Äôm dairy free) which was appreciated and it was a good speed of service from ordering to eating our delicious pizza. We got a large to share which was enough for us but if you‚Äôre a bigger eater, get your own.
The place is just off the road with a lovely rice field view and an excellent breeze that AC isn‚Äôt needed even on a super hot day (like today).
I definitely recommend trying them out, in person is nice because you get the pizza right out of the oven. We ate our pizza so fast the only picture I have is evidence that it was devoured haha!

Edit update: went back to enjoy again and this time they said they couldn‚Äôt do cheese on half of the pizza (I‚Äôm dairy free)‚Ä¶said they don‚Äôt do that‚Ä¶which clearly they do as per my first experience and review. So I‚Äôm knocking a star off for lack of consistency and my pure annoyance after this after such an big drive today to get here. Figure yourselves out.","Some of the best pizzas we‚Äôve ever had

We also had a courtesy Spa and massage. The staff are fantastic. They could not do enough to make our stay special. If we could give them 10 stars we would. Rob. & Carol NZ",Good breakfast. Rooms are meant to be luxury but are a bit sparse and have a distinct mold smell which is not pleasant. TV was not working and took 2 days to get attended to. Hot water was not working and needed to be fixed as well. Staff are very friendly and the pool and terrace are very nice.,"WORST STAY OF OUR TRIP
My husband and I booked this property for our honeymoon and were disappointed by the entire experience. This property claims to be a 3-minute drive to all the popular attractions but is actually 15-20 minutes away from everything so you end up spending so much time waiting around and paying extra for rides to get anywhere, which means you're also stuck in traffic all the time. They make it seem like the pool has these gorgeous views of rice terraces but it's actually completely overgrown and developed now. And, to top it all off our room was full of ants and spiders - on the bed, on the toilet, in the shower. When we asked for a cleaner room, they showed us another suite that also had ants and animal droppings on the floor and asked us to pay more for it. We wanted to switch hotels and asked if they would refund our remaining nights stays and they said no. We booked through Expedia whose international phone line wouldn't connect while we were abroad so we took pictures of everything and talked to them when we got back. Turns out they don't hold the property accountable to their listing or care about their customer experience. Best they could do is offer a 15% credit for the inconvenience - how generous from an 18 billion company - since the hotel wouldn't do anything to help rectify the situation either.  Save yourself the trouble and stay somewhere else, and better yet, don't book through Expedia!","We stayed for a few nights at Calma with our daughter, 10, and loved the place. We had the Pradha villa and would recommend it. The outdoor seating space in the villa was lovely and lish with flowering plants. The rooms were comfortable and well kept.  Many great night's sleep was had by all.

The restaurant and pool area were very pleasant. Comfortable seats and exceptional food. The dinners were delicious.  The afternoon tea was a great touch after exploring during the day and a swim in the pool.

The roads to the stay were the only downside as Bali has become much more congested with cars over the years. Still, barely detracts from the incredible experience at Calma.",Nice quiet place. Very serene and friendly staff. Two bedroom villa was nice and spacious

Thank you the hotel staff for being so friendly. You made us enjoy the trip so much.",A lovely little place to stay in Ubud. The rooms are beautiful and we loved that we could watch Netflix on the tv during our stay. The pool area was okay and there was a bit of construction going on which prevented us from sitting on our balcony for privacy reasons. They offer massages but they do it in the rooms instead of a separate spa area which wasn‚Äôt for me. The complimentary breakfast was absolutely outstanding!!! Lovely food and the restaurant area is so beautiful. A bit of a weird route to get to the compass rose and is quite out of the way.,"This is a hidden gem in Ubud. You can stay in the forest, admiring the view and relaxing.

The hotel was very clean, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the breakfast was as great as you'll find in more expensive accommodation in Ubud. When we were leaving, they gave us a pack of Bali coffee as a gift üéÅ

The only thing unfortunately was that there was construction around the hotel. It wasn't quite what we expected, but they had informed us in advance. So we didn't care because we weren't inside the hotel during the day.

Location was a bit far, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. Because, you have to use gojek or grab taxi to go anywhere in Ubud. Because there aren‚Äôt anysidewalks in Ubud where you can walk easily. So, by taxi, the location was also ok.","This is my least favorite accommodation among 6 places I stayed in Ubud in the last 16 days. It‚Äôs 20 mins away from Ubud but it traffic was terrible, if you want to stay away from the crowd, I suggest you to book a place near sweet orange trail. This place has nothing around, all the good restaurants are closer to the city. And there is a huge construction right next to it. Moreover the staffs are over caring I had three different staffs asking me when they can clean the rooms ü§£",It is a quiet place in a Somali village. The staff are nice.

The staff are really, really nice!","Loved the place, especially sounds of nature, our view to all the trees. Thank you for all your help with arranging taxi for us. We enjoyed the breakfast, it was great we could get filtered cold water to keep hydrated. Pool is a gem, we had great stay.","Almost perfect. We came here after a disappointing experience at the previous hotel. But this hotel and staff managed to turn it around completely. We had such and amazing time. Staff were amazing, always available and helpful. I would consider coming back here again. Rooms are good, may need small touch ups and look at better privacy items like natural screens etc.  overall highly recommend. Pool was good too. Some units have private pools. Food was good too","Escape! Inhuman! They had sent us messages prior to our arrival, urging us to be kind and give them a positive rating, emphasizing their struggles as a small business. Despite this, when my husband and I booked a stay, we encountered an issue at Singapore immigration preventing us from reaching Bali due to a passport discrepancy (5 months and 24 days instead of the required 6 months). Despite pleading for a refund because we were stranded in Singapore without the means to return home early or book a new stay, they callously canceled our reservation, kept the money, and cut off communication. If you're a compassionate human, spend your money elsewhere, as they seem solely driven by profit.","Really nice concept in a exceptional location, unfortunately though it's really far from the standards of a four star hotel.
The rooms need an immediate renovation and the management lacks the professionalism needed for a hotel of this price/category."

The villa is also fairly close to anything, only a 15 min bike ride away from the center :)","We absolutely loved our stay at Casa Pohon! Renjana villa was even prettier than the pictures. Especially loved the closet space, double bathroom vanities, and mini bar! Backyard view was beautiful and private. Staff was extremely helpful the entire trip with providing rides, drinks, and massages. The best part was location. We loved staying outside of the hustle and bustle of central Ubud. This allowed us to drive in when we wanted and otherwise relax and order in using the Grab app. Overall, this stay was excellent. Would absolutely recommend to anyone traveling to Bali!","Thank you so much for having us! We stayed in 5 locations on our Bali trip and this villa was our absolute favourite. Breathtaking views, attention to detail decor, everything is so well thought out. Very clean, helpful and kind staff.

We had the in room facial, full day tour booked through the villa too and loved every moment! Tried to extend, but it was already booked out sadly for us.

Ubud center is 10 min only. The staff is really friendly. The rooms are super clean. I absolutely recommend for couples or families too.","Do not book with this establishment! Used their official website which promised 50% payment at time of booking. Booked and confirmed. Now? Australian Bank Records confirm no attempt at securing deposit over 6 weeks ago! 3 days out from holiday: 7 unanswered calls, refusing to confirm what credit card they attempted and now the reservation mysteriously replaced at double the price for the next booking.

Hardworking Aussies? Do not book Portobello Ubud! Not only lying regarding financial transparency (which is already alarming), but also ripping off the next booking after us.

The villas are amazing, with your own private pool! We had breakfast included, definitely recommended, every morning we could choose from freshly made; smoothie bowls, pancakes, eggs, nasi, etc. Staying at Portobello felt like joining a family. Everyone is so friendly and caring. We had an amazing time! Matur suksma, selamat jalan!",Staff very sweet and attentive. The view is beautiful and so peaceful. Exactly what we needed to escape the hectic energy of uluwatu. We stayed for 1 day and I wish we could have stayed longer - highly reccomend.,"Loved our stay here, room with private pool was like a dream. Pool was amazing, was bigger than expected. The villa is more like a cabin, when you sleep you get to hear the sounds of nature when you sleep. Service was good, asked for extra towels of toiletries and wasn‚Äôt a problem. Only thing I missed was a smaller towel to dry my hair. Center of Ubud was only a 15 min drive by taxi  (when heavy traffic). They also provide scooter rentals in the hotel.

The visual experience from the design, furniture, swimming under trees, every detail down to the shell curtain holders is wow, a place that backs out onto a clear view of rice fields. What makes this exceptional though is the staff who are lovely and the system here is designed to be intimate - which means breakfast whenever you want it, if there's something specific you're after they'll know what to suggest like an old friend.","Wow! Just wow! I think I have found a truly 'hidden gem' in Bali.

I truly can't fault it. They have thought about EVERY single smallest detail to make our stay memorable.

From the moment we arrived, we received the most warmest welcome by the staff, along with a welcome drink. The staff took care of our luggage, and showed us to our beautiful hotel. We stayed in the Treehouse, and we had everything we could have possible asked for. I absolutely loved the details of every part of the property, the unique architecture, super comfortable beds, antique accessories, and all of sustainable factors they have implemented.

You can order breakfast, lunch and dinner to be delivered to your hotel, as well as book a massage, yoga matt, flower bath and a bubble bath - the perfect activities for a relaxing weekend away.

Oh, and I MUST mention the food! Honestly, I think I had the best Nasi Goreng in Indonesia. All the ingredients are locally sourced and everything was freshly prepared everyday. The lovely staff even bake fresh cookies and deliver them to our room each evening!

We also got to meet the owners who run the Stone House, Wendy and Walker - such incredible couple who've put in so much heart and soul to making the place feel homely, safe and luxurious.

Location wise, it is tucked away from all the roads, so you get complete piece and quiet, and some of the properties overlook the rice fields - complete dream! There is also security who look after the hotel, so you can complete unwind. I have stayed in many hotels in Bali, but I think this is by far the best boutique hotel I have ever stayed at!

Their attitude towards helping you and making sure you are having a great time is out of this world.

The staff was super friendly‚ÄîShoutout to the sweetest ladies Kadek & Eluh, they worked really hard to communicate with us despite our shared language barrier, and were incredibly attentive to any need we had with smiles on their faces.

The only real downside to the stay was the cleanliness level of the room and grounds. There could definitely been some more effort in upkeep throughout the property, but this is mentioned in previous reviews and we still chose this hotel because of the lower nightly rate, so bottom line we were mentally prepared for a bargain experience.

We would recommend Harum Sari to anyone looking for a peaceful and safe place to lay their heads at night outside the ever-lively Ubud.","Very good accommodation and very friendly staff.

But the dishes here are made with so much dedication that the wait is well worth it. You are surrounded by nature, the weather is good and the wait will be rewarded.

On the menu, they have several fresh smoothies, smoothie bowls (you can choose your own toppings), as well as toast with eggs (boiled or other kind). I chose fresh fruit plate with mango smoothie, toast with boiled eggs, coffee and banana pancakes. I didn't actually need to order the latter, I already had enough of the other dishes.

I definitely recommend going here!","Great local restaurant. The food was so delicious. We had the egg breakfast served with toast alongside the dragon fruit bowl.
Excellent service. I‚Äôd highly recommended!","We were staying nearby so had several breakfasts here.

AA is the best quality, low-price option I've found yet. 40k for a substantial bowl and you get to choose the toppings. Ingredients seem clean and fresh.

The cafe itself is a great place to work from also. The wifi is solid (30mbs) and there is a nice seating area upstairs. I had it all to myself. The only downside is the area is very loud - lots of construction, chatter, and a bike wash place across the street. I've got headphones in and that seems to do the trick.

Food is delicious and super affordable. All wrapped with ecofriendly materials but didn't compromise on the presentation at all.

The atmosphere is great with simple people.","A highlight of our stay in Ubud! Lovely staff and the most amazing home cooked meals - the pork ribs are a must! I wish we were staying longer just so that I could go back! Great prices, we got so much food for $17k."

Masala tea was awesome.
It‚Äôs hardly 10 mins from Ubud centre and definitely worth a visit.","Very good south Indian food ... last 3 days in Bali we were craving for Dosa,Idli,Wada.... we got it right here in center of Bali... Kannada,Tamil speaking staff and Manager made it more Homely away from my Bharat.

I'm sorry for the delivery order as a driver. If it takes a very long time to serve it, I'm a hungry customer and I'm also waiting.",Personal attention by Mr Sridhar and Mr Nandan. No exaggeration- Best Indian food we had in our last 6 days - Quality and quantity. A must visit place if you are in Ubud area.,The best Indian food in Bali. A huge relief from all those pretentious Indian restaurants. A must visit place just for food. It‚Äôs a makeshift place as of now. But now it‚Äôs going to be just worth for great food

Also the sauce is so delicious and tasty!) We also got a side of guacamole because we were craving chips and guac, as well as an a√ßa√≠ bowl. The fruit was so fresh and a√ßa√≠ base was smooth and fresh tasting. Great place for lunch. I also hear that they have live music at night and amazing cocktails. They also have shisha if you‚Äôre into hookah. Great place and great service a bit away from the crowded Ubud tourist spots.","I'm so happy to find this lovely little restaurant. Great selection on the menu....the ribs are super delicious. Very cosy atmosphere, friendly staff, good service.
On Wednesday nights, there's a cool blues duo playing there - Mang Frezy and Putu giving up some classic blues tunes.","Last night, me and my family went to this restaurant and I love the food, we had the best grill pork rib in Ubud. The place was nice, and as well as the service from the staff was excellent. I highly recommend to everyone who stay in Ubud,.","Came here today with the family. Wanted to eat a steak, but surprise, surprise: no steak at this ‚ÄúGrill‚Äù.

Instead we took the recommended ribs, a pulled pork meat burger and a lentil soup. The soup was the highlight. Nice consistency and good flavors. The burger was ok, but not as nice as it looks on the picture. The ribs were a disappointment ! The meat little and hard ! We had to change one portion and had huge left overs from the 2nd. God thanks there was a cute stray dog which we could feed with the left overs.

Would I come again ? Not for the food. For a drink, maybe. The ambiance is actually pretty chilled."

Good WiFi connection.","The staff is all you can ask for: responsive, friendly and resolutive.
The pool area is beautiful and very well maintained, perfect for a swim anytime.
The restaurant is a nice option for dinner and breakfast, a bit more expensive than other options but great considering that the resort is a bit far away from the city.
Another awesome thing was that hey arranged our scooter rental, which was really easy and free of the usual bureocratic stress of renting a vehicle. For three days of scooter we paid 240K IDR, great deal :)",Picture perfect villa with excellent service. Very humble staff and great food. Location of the villa is also good but the entrance is very narrow and makes it difficult for a car to enter with ease. All in all a great experience for us.,"Had an awesome stay here for 4 days in Ubud. People working here are so nice and helpful.

Mr. Kadek is a very helpful owner who assisted our travelling group with any request.

The room was spacious having water filter, tv, ac and refrigerator. With a big balcony.

The restaurant was very good, decently priced. We ordered like every day.

There is one narrow alley which you need to go through to reach the place.  big cars may not enter. Our Toyota Rush went fine, you can ask any queries with Mr. Kadek."

The rooms are wonderful, clean, very well kept and cleaned daily. The outdoor private pool is magnificent accompanied by two day beds, two covered sitting areas, and beautiful landscaping/gardens.

Being a short scooter out of town made the place very quiet, personal and serene. Staff delivered a scooter to Rai Bungalows for 70k IDR/day and made it effortless to explore.
We had two massages that were hosted in our room which were both facilitated by Rai Bungalows.
Free WiFi and water provided also.",Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 4 nights and it was exceptional. They kept the place so clean. And the room is so spacious! The bed was so comfy it made it hard to leave in the morning! The staff are so friendly and go out of there way to help you with anything you need. It's very central if you have a scooter! They provided us with one so it was so convenient.  the pool was stunning and made it extra special. Thank you guys for a fantastic stay.,"Great place to stay. Beautiful back yard, and a nice pool. No television or safe in this place however, but you don't need a television in Bali anyway, you aren't here for the tv. Neighbours are usually other tourists, but you usually won't see or hear from them. The place is a little small, but is great for the 3 we currently have staying here. Great food just down the road at ITHAKA and they will even deliver. I highly recommend this place.",Home.  Simply stated. Isn't that what we all look for when we travel?

The food is great, Nasi Goreng being the best I had across Bali. So much so, that we got back to Ubud from Seminyak to have the last breakfast before leaving Bali. The staff is really cordial, we had a great time thanks to Astri. Definitely visit the place for a calm vibe and beautiful ambience.","After 20+ days of eating only local food (Nasi Goreng, Mie Goreng, Nasi Campur, Sate Ayam, etc‚Ä¶), I finally broke down and ordered something non-Balinese, Chicken Kabab special (IDR 95K), at Noya. And surprisingly, I was not disappointed! The flavors are very good (as evidenced by the before and after pictures below). Of course, they are not 100% as authentic as in the Middle East, or at various Persian restaurants in my hometown, Los Angeles area (üòÅ). But it is ENAK.
Best thing is the cooling breezes that blow in from the little rice paddy that also provides the wonderful view for this restaurant gem away from the crazy Ubud center.","Tonight I had the pleasure to eat at Noya Kitchen for my last dinner in Ubud and it was a beautiful surprise! First of all: the location is amazing, both the surroundings and the restaurant are beautiful and peaceful, you eat hearing to sound of nature. Second, the service was great, the front of house was always attentive and friendly. Last but not least, the food is great! You have both options between traditional and international food. I had a delicious pumpkin soup and my friend had a traditional Indonesian meal. The portions are generous and the taste is amazing! We shared a tiramisu as a dessert and, as an Italian girl, I couldn't feel the difference between the one I eat in Italy and the one here. Unfortunately we didn't think about taking pictures.
Thank you Noya Kitchen!! See you next time","Best place to eat outside of crowded streets of polluted Ubud center. We had breakfast and lunch for several days and each time we were very pleased with the quality of the dishes. I do recomend the Noya chicken kebab, chicken breast with lemon and the 1st desert on their menu (vanilla and blueberry).","Fast service, gourmet European food, beautiful location, comfortable quite place.

I strongly recommend to visit Noya!

1) Chicken in vine( Saltimbocca alla Romana) 10/10
2) Dutch Goulash 10/10
3) Dessert: Rote Grutze üëç just a bit expensive on my opinion"
