Cleanliness is maintained well. There are certain  issues, though. A lot of very basic things aren't available, starting with drinking water. On one of the two days of our stay, they didn't provide us any water bottles at all. Upon asking, they said that they had run out of mineral water bottles. The next day, they said that they had run out of soda, so any drinks made with soda would be unavailable. We were told that slippers would be available but when we asked for them, they said that the manufacturer isn't providing them slippers of all sizes, so they're unable to provide us slippers! On Day 2 of our stay, they took our towels and dental kits out, presumably to replace them with new ones but never replaced them for that entire day, except the towels. We got the dental kits and the water bottles only the next morning before our checkout.

Another issue is that they are so paranoid about guests causing harm to their furniture that they keep mentioning that the guests would have to pay a fine if the bed is broken or any other furniture is damaged. Instead of a welcome drink, we were greeted with this warning at the time of check-in. But that wasn't all. Once we went into the room, we found a huge list of items in the room and the fines that would be levied on us in case we damaged any item. This included the keys, the door, the cupboard, and even spoons, plates, and knives. Even the kettle came with the warning that if it was damaged, a fine would be charged. One assumes that they might have encountered destructive guests in the past but this repeated oral and written warning to guests about the consequences of any breakage of any item doesn't seem like very hospitable behaviour, honestly. Plus, it's not like their furniture was great anyway. The bed creaked so much that we were awakened from our sleep every time we turned on the bed. There were spots on the sofa and the study chair, the AC was dripping, and the curtains wouldn't close completely which brought in a lot of light from outside.

Finally, the food wasn't good at all. Everything was practically tasteless. We'd ordered several items for different meals such as sandwiches, chicken steak, fries, fried rice, etc, and the cooking was consistently bad for all the items. Even the cocktails were poorly made.","When we came to our room, the staff sprayed a fragrance which means that the room was not cleaned for a few days/ months. Even after spraying, a very foul smell came out of the room and bathroom. The bathroom and room had spiders and insects. The lights of the room at night suddenly changed, like there was a ghost. The bed was big but had brown stains and stains of lipstick. When we told this problem to the staff, they told me to call the owner, but the owner wasn't picking up. I guess the owner only wants good reviews for his hotel and he doesn't want to improve his hotel. Food was bad. Pool was dirty with insects. Servicing was very late during dinner even when there was no person sitting. The photos on Google are fake. Never visit this hotel. The owner will reply to this if he wants to improve his hotel.","Visited on 27-May-24, it was really an amazing place to stay here. Private pool with two rooms we can really enjoy the service, location, food, common swimming pool, etc. Food was awesome, quantity and quality was very much satisfied. Food cost also moderate compare to city price. We are happy with all the aspect. Also as a feedback informed Mr.Vayu to take care of the restroom doors are not function well and need more attention on cleaniness in the terrace wood furnitures. Apart from this fully satisfied.","Just spent 4 amazing days here. Rooms huge ,wish the bathroom at home was same size. Food amazing staff very helpful and friendly, Rita served us mostly with a trainee serving us twice always with a huge smile. Sorry I can't remember your name but the man we always meet at reception was always welcoming and friendly. Very interested in Scotland and also my husbands hobby looking at all his photos stars moon and sun. Will definitely be back next February","One of the worst place to live in.
It's a one star hotel not a four star.
Hot water does not come all the time.
You will get only 2 towel a day(you are on an island, you will need more)
Pools are not clean.
Daily housekeeping does not clean bathtub.
You ask for anything and they start crying. Creamer took 3 calls.
There are better hotel in this price range."

The only downside is that access to and from the river is a bit difficult. If you struggle with stairs or balance this is not for you. There are about 450 stairs each way and they are uneven and different heights between each step. In addition to this, they are slippery so I recommend wearing reef shoes ( not thongs).
The rafting experience is very good and a lot of fun.
The lunch provided at the end is traditional Balinese.","Easily out highlight. SUTA was our tour guide. You can tell he enjoys his work.
One of the most fun i had in my past years. The view was stunning and reminded my of jurassic park. If you aren't doing water rafting here, then you're missing out.
There is a hike down of 15 minutes and hike up at the end of also 15 minutes tho. It was not bad tho, instead quite nice because you got to experience rice fields and nature again. Beautiful experience all in all.
The lunch after was also very good. Good seasoning and flavor.","Well worth the money and time. Staff were very helpful and friendly.  We brought our whole family of 6 people including my parents who were over 60 and our kid aged 9. The staff assigned to us was extremely seasoned and knew exactly what to do in the entire course. If there's one thing to take note, is the fact that you will need to climb down quite a bit of stairs to reach the rafting area; and more importantly climb up a lot of stairs after the ride. The entire raft experience was fantastic, passing by incredible scenery and we thoroughly enjoyed all the dips and bumps along the way. You will also stop by a waterfall for a photo taking session and a pit stop where you can take a rest and have a drink. Lastly, once you get transported back to their base of operation, you will be treated with an incredibly delicious buffet lunch. I'm not sure if its because we were hungry and the food was truly amazing. Highly recommended!","Hate the stairs but.. Love the places, love the vibes and the staff especially the one who leads the way is very very nice pak sujeneng?sujana? i think if I'm not wrong. He likes father vibes and is really fun to talk with.

Bcs i personally really hate the stairs üò≠üò≠ but he kept encouraging me, kept motivate me, and even waits for me üëç. Thanks you pak üôèüôè

The food is good 4.5/5 really energized me after the stairs exercise","They organized everything almost perfect, but one thing: THE STAIRS!!!
Unfortunately you have to climb the stairs down to get to the river and another climb the stairs up after your boat arrives at the ending point.
From this Ayung Rafting to the starting and ending point, pick-up cars already there to take you so you don't need to do another walk.
Their guide really works their strength out to control the boat. The passengers only need a little power to paddle or not paddle at all.

They also provide you with plastic bags for your wet clothes and provide you with a towel if you wanna take a bath (also has soap and shampoo at the shower).

The most important thing is about food!
They serve foods with local cuisine for you to regain your stamina. Too bad I was too starved so I forgot to take a picture of my food. But the taste is 4.5 out of 5.0."

I felt really safe the whole time. Our guide made sure we were always ok and having fun.

They make different stops along the way so you get to buy water, beer or something to drink. They also offer pic and video services at the end of the tour.

It is very steep going down and up, and it is not friendly for people with disabilities. So keep that in mind when booking

We were offered a complementary lunch after the tour. It was good.

They also have showers and clean towels for you to use after the experience.",highly recommended rafting in Ubud. Dont worry even you cant swim :) The scenery around the river is stunning and absolutely breathtaking. Just a little warning that you must be quite fit to take this rafting since we need to climb down the hill to the river (and it was pretty deep and steep; it took around 20 minutes to get down to the river). In summary; I would say if you have not tried rafting in Ubud; you have not been to Bali yet.,A fabulous rafting trip with the best river guide.  Quite a steep walk down to and up from the river if it is an issue for you.  Friendly and fun with just the right amount of choppy water.  Very happy - Thanks!,This trip was an amazing experience for me and my family. Everyone was really nice and organization was also really good. A truck picked us up and we drove for about 15 minutes and then we walked 600 steps down to the river and at the and another 400 steps back up. Rafting took about 2 hours. While rafting we had a few breaks so we got something to drink. After we returned back we were offered some food and we could buy the photos of us. Overall this was a great experience and I highly recommend to everyone.

Lastly the cleanliness was 10/10 definitely recommend and will come back again.","Komaneka Tanggayuda blew me away! Stunning villas, a magical atmosphere, and the friendliest, most helpful staff made my stay unforgettable. From villa facilities & great villa optimizing relaxation, to attentive service and attention to small details; everything was pure luxury.  Highly recommended specially for honeymooners and will definitely be my choice if back to Bali!
I would only recommend heating the pool to seek perfection.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è","Our stay at Komaneka at Tanggayuda was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment we stepped through the doors, we were blown away by the level of cleanliness and attention to detail. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of our stay was perfect, without ever being intrusive.

I can't thank the team enough for saving our holidays, which were almost ruined when we stayed in another hotel. Their professionalism and dedication turned what could have been a disaster into a truly memorable experience.

The food was incredible, every meal was a winner, and we were consistently impressed by the quality and variety offered, they truly exceeded our expectations.

Overall, I can't recommend Komaneka at Tanggayuda highly enough. Whether you're looking for a relaxing getaway or a memorable vacation, this hotel should be at the top of your list.

I know it will be the first place I look to stay on our next trip.","Located slightly outside of Ubud city, this resort is perfect if you are seeking for quietness and relax outside the city buzz. Being literally across the jungle, one might have some encounters with some insects or frogs (strictly outside the rooms, never got one in mine) but I would say it is expected given the location which is in deep contact with nature. The facility provides 3 amazing pools, a restaurant, an equipped gym and a boutique. They also offer yoga classes and other activities for their guests, including shuttle services which are available free of charge to bring you to the city center. What I found exceptional was the staff, very professional, kind and always ready to the craziest requests one might have, this has really made the difference to me.
The food served at the restaurant is delicious and full of options for all tastes. In our case breakfast and afternoon tea were included in the fare and they were both top notch. Very nice experience, thank you to all the staff!","In my opinion one of the best hotel from Ubud.
Very kind, friendly and helpful staff with all we need. They were always attentive and supportive to our requests.
Cosy and tranquil resort in the middle of the jungle where you can relax and enjoy the sound of the jungle.
Clean and beautiful villas.
Very nice restaurant with amazing view and very good food.
A gorgeous public infinity pool with jungle view.
Daily activities and complementary afternoon tea.
Everything is perfect in the smallest detail.
We have nothing to complain."

A must-visit for Indian food lovers in Bali!","Extremely overpriced for what it is, the platter was a joke definitely not worth anything near the 95k you only get 8 very small pieces to try. Don‚Äôt get me wrong we do not eat large portions but I don‚Äôt think the platter is suitable for even one person for the price let alone two. The rest of the food is average at best! I had the Veg Biryani and it was very underwhelming and certainly not worth 90k. My girlfriend had the Paneer Makhani and it was very bland and definitely not worth the 120k that was an absurd price for how bad and small it was. I will also mention that the tables were very sticky and not clean. So to wrap this up save yourself the headache and money don‚Äôt go here it is a 1/10.","Good view, good food and quick service. Must try Pindi chole Punjab style.","-10000 stars. This place is TRIBBLE. The good reviews must be the owners pals. We ordered the pakadoa platter which was 95,000idr that was 6 prices of 1 bite deep fried garbage. Wasn't worth even 5,000. Also ordered 2 of the mains, tiny portions and below average taste and again waay over priced. Never receieved our drink and was informed no flat or Naan bread after we ordered our mains.

Initially I was worried that the villa will be isolated and unsafe but there‚Äôs another villa just nearby also owned by the same owner.

We especially enjoyed the breakfast provided, they served us plenty of sweet and fresh fruits as well as eggs, noodles, bread, etc. They arranged it according to our timing in our villa. For the price paid, we have no complains and will definitely recommend friends to go.

The only thing is there‚Äôs quite a lot of ants in one of the rooms, somehow they came in from outside and it just keep coming near our beds.

Ngakan and his team are super helpful, friendly and accommodating. He responded very quickly to some requests we had. We really appreciated the airport transfer he organised for us. The breakfast cooked for us each morning was a very special treat!

We will definitely be back if we ever return to Bali - we didn't want to leave! Thank you Ngakan and team for a magical stay üíï

P.S. We highly recommend the seafood restaurant next door if you want some delicious fish.","We stayed at Umah Sunset recently with 2 kids. The villa had a beautiful setting directly overlooking the rice field. The pool opens out to the rice fields, which was beautiful and it was lovely to wake up to the view. The rooms felt luxurious and were very well appointed. The bedding and amenities were on par with any luxury resort but with the coziness of a private villa. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They came in at required times but also respected our privacy.

There is also a little warung just a short walk from the villa where we were able to get fresh vegetarian local food, which was useful.

Overall a comfortable and memorable experience at Umah Sunset . Would recommend to anyone visiting ubud.","A pearl in Ubud! A dream villa with two bedrooms, plus extra living room, everything you basically want ( infinity pool overlooking the rice fields, wifi, fridge / freezer combo, first aid kit etc etc).
We were three (wife + almost 5 year old son) and we have not missed anything.
Starting with the pickup service by the owner at the airport, the coffee/tea banana pancake, omelet, fresh fruit in the morning and especially the great taxi + guide services by the owner! What a sympathetic guy, super friendly and accommodating. Drove us everywhere, answered all our questions along the way (The owner of the villa used to do a lot of historical work so has a lot of knowledge about Bali history and culture) and was always ready when we wanted to go back to the beautiful villa.

He & the villa have spoiled us so much, so everything else after that were in the shadow of Umah Sunset. 1000% recommendation, 5+ Stars for this location (and rarely give reviews). We will be back and we will bring friends!",Absolutely loved our stay at Umah Sunset. Our host Ngakan and his son Made ensured everything was looked after to make our stay as comfortable and relaxing as possible. Great private location with stunning views over the rice paddies. The local warung on the road in front of the villa also serves some lovely local meals and the ladies who run the place are very friendly and accommodating. Also recommend a visit to the Neka Art Museum where Ngakan was General Manager - he gave us a great guided tour. Overall a great place to escape life for a while and enjoy your own little paradise.
