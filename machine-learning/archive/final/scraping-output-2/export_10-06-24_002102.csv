Best. Stay. Ever.
We have visited 82 countries and stayed in all kinds of facilities, from the most basic to extreme luxury.
Lempuyang Boutique Hotel definite stood out and left a very positive impression. In fact, I cannot think of a hotel where we had a better experience.
Amazing location and views, very -very- nice rooms and an excellent restaurant. These are all predictably important and all boxes were ticked; but the staff makes the difference. Everyone, from the manager to the gardener, was kind, friendly and helpful. They showed genuine interest and enthusiasm, were there when you need them and always available for help or just a chat.","We visited the Lempuyang Boutique Hotel in September and had an unforgettable time. The warm and highly qualified service made our stay memorable. Our room was consistently clean, adorned with fresh frangipani flowers. The breakfasts were delicious, offering fresh fruits and cocktails, and the coffee stood out as the best among all the places we've visited. The pool was impeccably maintained, and the grounds were always well-groomed.

We frequented the hotel restaurant and found that every dish we tried was of a high standard, it felt like the chef paid meticulous attention to detail. Thank you very much for providing us with an unforgettable experience at your hotel","This place is total paradise. We came for our honeymoon, and want to come back again. The staff were all incredible; thoughtful, considerate, helpful, professional, and masters of their craft. The resort itself is perfectly maintained with stunning views, and lots of different places to sit and enjoy them. The food was amazing, and the four course breakfast became one of our favorite parts of the day.
They also have a series of tours with local partners. Being able to book a private trip to some of the islands most popular attractions, for very reasonable prices, with expert guides/drivers, took our vacation to the next level. It took out all the guess work and stress and ensured that every day of our vacation was used to it's full potential.
We would absolutely recommend the Lempuyang Boutique Hotel to all of our friends and family.","Long story short: BEST HOTEL OF THE REGION.

Just look at the view from your bedroom – a dream come true. We stayed in the recently completed adult-only area, and it's impeccably done. The bedroom is massive, and so is the bed. It's a haven of relaxation; you won't be disappointed.

The staff is exceptionally attentive to your needs and always smiling – they'll take excellent care of you.

As for the food, the lunch and dinner menu is spot-on in terms of quality for the price. The only drawback I found was with their breakfast. It lacks a substantial main course, and even after eating everything, you might not necessarily feel full.

NB: We went there in July 2023","Had the best experience for the second time! The place is stunning, super calm, the ideal place to unwind, and the staff super friendly. Special shoutout to Saprina and Tami for their amazing service. Will definitely come back!"
