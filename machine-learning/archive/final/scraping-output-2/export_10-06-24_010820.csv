Overall il give rating for the hotel. It was meh...bed is huge...but cleanliness i gotta scream,We get a big mattress and spacious room. Clean swimming pool too. This is really worth the money. The location is very strategic near the main road however will be jammed during rush hours.,"Had to pick this one after a failed check-in at my initial choice and needed to find a new place soon because it's already late and I didn't regret it. Decent hotel but has anything I need for my business trip. Good location, it was quiet, clean room though just for night stay, but the super slow and unstable wifi was very disappointing. Anything else was fine, aircon was cold enough, hot water came out slow but okay. Quick check-in and proper service for a low budget hotel. Spacious parking space at basement.","A good hotel to stay.
A room has a lot of space and a comfortable bed.
A good location of the hotel, you can reach any point in Denpasar.
Also, they have a huge parking zone under the hotel, making your bike/car safe.
Friendly staff","Recommend. value for money. will book again

Pro :
- Cheap
- spacious room size
- spacious parking area
- refrigerator, indoor trash bin, hotel sandal, towel, pull tissue, toothbrush
- pool & restaurant hotel

Cons :
- Location (a little bit remote), street a bit narrow. but no problem if you rent a motorbike, easy to access gift shop in denpasar area.
- when i'm checking the elevator on repair and access to restaurant hotel limited start from 15.00.
- Checking time only start on 14.00 if i'm not forget

Note :
second visit got a king size single bed but there were dirty stains and the toilet seat was wobbling like it was about to break."

Friendly staffs. I think the people who hang out there are locals dont pay but use the internet....slows down the wifi. Maybe i could be wrong. Try one day stay and u do the judge. Maybe im wrong.,A pleasant stay in a standard twin room. The reception staff are friendly and helpful. The room is spacious and the beds are very comfortable. A kettle in the room would be nice. The pool area looks nice and the water is warm. There are small ants in the room and the furniture is a bit outdated but overall a pleasant stay.,"Terrible attitude towards customers: we agreed to check into the room with our small dog, and after unpacking things, we were told that dogs were not allowed and we needed to move out of the room.  Our friends check in with a small child and saw 2 huge cockroaches in the toilet, after which they also decided to leave.  At the same time, 50,000 were withheld by hotel from us, allegedly for the costs of settling.  The area is also very awful, a narrow road, I do not advise this hotel to anybody who likes a good attitude and service.","1. They are stubborn in arranging room in timing.
2. Not giving room as we booked
3. No soap in bathroom. All we have to ask
4. Wi-Fi not fast. In lobby NO Wi-Fi. There is Wi-Fi only for staff.. Playing game.
5. Giving 3rd. Floor.. Sold the room in upstairs BUT, ALL THE TIME GIVING REASON ""LIFT NOT WORK"" (permenantly)
6. No have breakfast. cafe closed. Only setup as cafe.
7. No tolerance for emergency cause LATE CHECK OUT. I paid 100000 rp.
Even I booked and not check in my 1st. day. (the hotel rules grab the money)
DONT BOOK THIS HOTEL. U WILL REGRET.","I did stay tbis hotel 3 night. When we arrive many have free room they are make we wait hot weather reseption check in time .  After check in  wifi so bad and 1 day not give wifi. They are want give in room hot water macine night  rent 25.000 Rupiah 3 night 75.000 rupies  if you buy new market same price . We in room 1 per night stay 115.000 rupies, but we broken 1 normal cheap glass i think buy pi≈üir new 4.000 rupies but wehen we check out  reseption want from we 65.000 rumors same outside 12 picea glass.

During the delivery to our hotel we have been charged for extra cost but the cost was unexpectedly high. We thought it will be okay since we can match to our schedule. It wasn't.

For 80k rupiah you get a big cup of es teler, fresh sweet watermelon/jackfruit/white coconut pieces+green jelly+white strip jelly (idk what this was) and basil seeds in coconut milk. Not too sweet, perfect. Second time round wasn't as nice, sweetness was a bit high and watermelon wasn't as sweet. That being said it's sooo much better than any other es teler I had! More fresh fruits and no weird syrups added :)

The bakso was also not bad, the soup was like mild chicken soup, prefer this over the other shops too. Worth a visit!","Not a fancy place, yet the bakso (meatball) is tasty, es teler is yummy, I've been there many many times.",The bakso is yummy,Top,Good service
