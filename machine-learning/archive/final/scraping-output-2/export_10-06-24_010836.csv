Moreover, hotels offer a variety of facilities such as pools, spas, and fitness centers, allowing guests to relax and rejuvenate during their visit. Overall, staying at a hotel is an indulgent experience that elevates any trip or vacation.","Our holiday here has been amazing, the value for money is excellent.
The rooms could do with a bit of a makeover as could some of the hotel exterior. But the staff, food, and general amenities more than make up for this.
Staff are always happy and very helpful. Our daughter fell over and twisted her ankle quite badly. The staff were extremely helpful, organising a trip to the local hospital for an x-ray and ride back.
We booked a cooking class, which was great fun too.
We would book here again if/when we return to Bali.","So, the hotel's a bit old, but they really keep it up well. The pool's huge and super clean, and breakfast has tons of stuff to choose from.

The staff are awesome, and the location's convenient.

The only quirky thing is the bathroom situation in the bedroom - there's no door, but they've got these two tiny separate spaces for the toilet and shower, kinda like in a public restroom.

But hey, we had a good time overall!","The hotel offers exceptional service with attentive staff who go above and beyond to ensure a comfortable stay.

You need to know that there are low tides so you can't go into the water. Mostly evening. The only bad thing i can say is that there are annoying ladies with shops. They follow you and disturb you while relaxing and they are very insistent.,"One of the great sunrise beaches in Bali.
The water is calm, and you will be rewarded with tranquility and gorgeous golden sunrise in good weather.

Although I took hundreds of photos for hundreds of sunrises, they are never the same. Sometimes when the tide is low you can explore walking around among the sea grass and find sea critters.

This is not a surfing beach but suitable for SUP (stand up paddle), kayaking, windsurfing (during certain time of the day), swimming, playing with dogs, soaking or just sit there in the sand contemplating your life choices. I believe there are free yoga classes every morning.","This beach is a good place to witness the amazing sunrise in Bali. Been there a lot of time. At night, this beach is less crowded so it's good to release some stress.","This is the nicest beach I've ever seen in Bali so far, it's beautiful, clean, not too crowded. I like that they have pavement all along the beach line so people can ride a bicycle there, there are few places that provide bicycles if you want to rent it, so you can go cycling along the beach line.

The sand is clean, the water is so clean, it's pristine which makes you able see the bottom and the plants under the water. I can play and running around the beach barefoot without stepping on rocks or pebbles. The water and the tide is calm, it's a perfect beach to play if you have a little kid. The beach was quiet and it's wide, so you have a big space to play without worry about bump into somebody.

They have a place that looks like a small rock mountain which has gazebo in it, it's located a little further from the shore, you just have to walk through the water few meters to get there.

There are many stores and restaurants nearby from the beach, just go to the main street then you will find them, it's such a nice area. I really love this beach! My wife and my daughter also enjoyed the time we spent here, this is my new favorite spot in Bali. Maybe next time I will explore another beach in this area. -Jul 2023","This is such a gem of a beach. At low tide there is so much to see and explore. We must have come back here three or four times and saw different tidal animals each time. Beautiful place to watch the sunrise, relax, and just take some time to unwind"

We stayed in Duplex Room and read on previous reviews the lighting is an issue and have to agree with that. Especially as it is not something difficult to fix and the rooms are extremely dark making it difficult to see anything and often had to use our phone lights. Stronger bedside lights will already help. But putting in an extra light fixture somewhere in main area is definitely necessary.","room is too dark. You need to install more lamps and lights. Windows in room are not completely close-able and all kinds of bugs can just directly come in to the room. There are too many bugs in the beds. Overall my experience was awful. However the hotel staffs were amazingly sweet and kind. I appreciate the front desk lady who took best care of us. She was an Adorable lady. Other than that, hotel itself needs to consider developing better room condition.","We loved our stay at the hotel. We stayed for four days. Staff is amazing, very polite and always welcoming and ready to help.

Hotel itself is very clean. Pool is amazing as well as the food options they have provided. Very close to a small shopping area and a circle K. Small walk to the beach and lots of local shops and food options.

Room is pretty big and clean but toilet/ bathroom can be bit more cleaner.

Overall I would highly recommend the place and would definitely come back.","Fantastic location, well situated on the main road in Sanur. Staff very attentive, so friendly and helpful and polite. The restaurant serves breakfast everyday, and was much better than expected for a hotel buffet. Several times during the week the restaurant offered different different themed buffets each night for a few, and also happy hours with cocktails.
The plunge pool was a delight to come back to after a long day out in the heat! Would definitely recommend and would love to come back. Thanks","Great location, friendly staff and exceptional breakfast! Love the Balinese breakfast corner - a real highlight of my stay in Bali.

The rooms were just ok. There was sand on the floor when I arrived that I tried to clean up, but it is hard to clean up sand. Through the 4 nights, I could still feel it (and I didn't step foot on the beach). In addition, the shower didn't work properly. The water did not spray out so I had to pull the handheld off and hold it over my head. Overll, though, it was a very nice stay.","Beautiful resort hotel on the beach. Starfish restaurant is excellent and my dinner with 2 beers was about 8 dollars.

Our spacious room was a dream - plenty of room for the kids to sprawl out, and the comfy beds ensured everyone slept like royalty.

Speaking of relaxation, the pool was the perfect place to cool off under the Bali sun. It was clean, refreshing, and just the right size for splashing around with the little ones. And for those moments when you need a quick workout, the gym, though small, had everything you need to stay active.

But here's the real star of the show: the service! The staff at Cork Restaurant were absolutely phenomenal. They were attentive, friendly, and always willing to go the extra mile to make sure our experience was top-notch. From delicious breakfasts to helpful recommendations for exploring Sanur, they truly made us feel welcome.

Little touches like the complimentary bottled water and welcome snacks waiting in our room upon arrival made a big difference too. You can tell Maison Aurelia cares about the details, and it shows!

This wasn't our first stay at Maison Aurelia. We actually came here during the pandemic, and it's amazing to see how this beautiful hotel has not only survived but thrived! They've clearly put a lot of love and effort into maintaining their high standards, and it definitely pays off.

Here's my honest recommendation to all you travelers out there: If you're looking for a luxurious yet family-friendly haven in Sanur, look no further than Maison Aurelia. You won't regret it!

P.S. Don't forget to indulge in the bathroom amenities - the shampoo and shower gel smell and feel divine! Trust me, after a long day of exploring, it's the perfect way to unwind.","Fabulous hotel, all the staff are super helpful and very friendly...
Excellent location an easy walk to the beach, plenty of eateries just outside the door.
The rooms are massive and very luxurious. The only downside would be the loud music from a couple of bars on the street but doesn't play all night..","I do not write reviews and this resort prompted me to write one. This is probably the best location in Sanur if you are looking for a peaceful vacation .This place felt quiet and peaceful through our entire stay. Very close to the airport and beach.. Staff members are also very helpful.
Rooms are big and super clean with amazing design.
Thoroughly impressed, highly recommended. well worth the money.
Great Management.","My review on this:

- The room: Spacious! That's the first thing I noticed. The bed was very comfortable and I slept really well. The curtains aren't blackout curtains so if you're a light sleeper that's trying to catch up with your sleep after a big night, best to get eye masks. The bathroom although it's on the smaller side, but it's really what you need. You're able to ask the front desk for amenities however it won't be something readily available in your bathroom. I love how they have turn down service. I always look forward to what snack they'll bring me at night.

- facilities: I like how they provide water cooler on each floor! Such a good thing to have. The pool area is nice and it's by the restaurant

- in-room dining: the hotel and the restaurant are managed by 2 different groups, hence you can't opt to charge your meal to your room. That was a bit inconvenient to have to pay every single time I order for food vs getting it charged to the room.

- breakfast: breakfast menu was good and simple. I was happy with it

- staff: the hotel staff are fantastic! Very helpful. and friendly. On the other hand, the restaurant staff wasn't as friendly.

Overall, it was a great experience! Will come back again if I happen to need to stay in Sanur.","Stayed here for 4 nights on a business trip, and it was fantastic. The staff were very helpful during my stay, the room itself was gorgeous. If you prefer hotels with nice interiors, this place is for you. Tons of Balinese details around the hotel and the room.

The hotel smells so good. The welcome drink (cinnamon tea) is delicious, the staff even taught me how to brew the drink.

Breakfast needs more variations, though (it was probably because I stayed for 4x breakfast. It got a bit boring).

Overall, it was a great experience!"

The atmosphere was perfect for a family gathering, with a stunning beachfront setting that added a special touch to our celebration.

We opted for the ""rijsttafel"" menu, which was a fantastic choice for our family. The food was amazing, with generous portions that ensured everyone had their fill. Each dish was fresh and perfectly cooked, highlighting the quality and care put into the meal.

While waiting for dinner, we relaxed on the beach, sipping on refreshing mocktails and fresh coconuts. The kids had a great time playing and swimming in the calm waters of Sanur Beach, which added to the joy of the day.

Dinner was a highlight, not just for the delicious food but also for the unique dining setup. We ate at a beautifully set table with our feet in the sand, making the experience even more special and memorable. Eating barefoot with the sand beneath our feet truly added to the charm of the evening.

Overall, Tandjung Sari provided an exceptional dining experience that was perfect for celebrating a special occasion. The combination of excellent food, a beautiful beach setting, and the unique dining arrangement made it a night to remember. Highly recommended!","This was the most amazing experience!

The rooms are amazing as well . The bathtub like a pool. Clean. And the stuff is super kind .
Thank you for everything 🙏🏻",Still my favourite gem of a hotel in Bali. Legendary history from Bowie to jagger being regular customers.

A must visit for anyone who appreciates the true appeal of golden days Bali. It still exists.,A lovely heritage hotel with beautiful beach view.

Please give them a big thank you! Breakfast bought to the villa each morning was fresh, delicious and plentiful, and was so easy to order online. I had an amazing treatment at the Spa. So many nice little touches that set this place apart from other properties, the personalised villa sign which we were able to purchase to bring home as a momento of our trip, the gifts left at turndown each night, the flower petal baths on arrival, and a special birthday gift. We arrived very late at night, and were still given welcome drinks and a snack, which was much appreciated. The property is in a great location close to restaurants, shopping and the beach (or a short Grab ride away if preferred). They were very accommodating at guaranteeing my request for a 2 bedroom villa with interconnecting bedrooms as we had children with us, even with booking many months in advance. We will definitely stay again on our next visit, and can't wait to come back. It truly is a little piece of heaven on earth with amazing Balinese hospitality😊","What a special place, perhaps our favourite overall accommodation worldwide. Staff are all so kind and helpful. Villas get a customer wooden sign with your last name for the duration of your stay! Our villa (26) was spacious and beautifully decorated, with a front patio and garden/pond and a back private heavenly outdoor shower. Lots of choices for the included breakfast, which was delivered to our villa at our specified time. The pool area was surrounded by lush gardens with flowers. The drive up to reception off the busy road is a bamboo-lined tunnel-lane. The onsite spa was exceptional. Prices for all experiences, drinks and food (even the minibar!) were the same or lower than elsewhere in the neighbourhood. We absolutely loved everything about our stay and highly recommend it!","I spent my wedding anniversary in this place. The place is very beautiful, and there is wonderful privacy. All the employees working in the place were at the top of their wonderful manners. They received us with a smile and offered beautiful guidance. The breakfast was very delicious. Thank you to all the employees. I highly recommend this place to spend beautiful days.",Great hotel. Far enough away from the main road that you don't hear any cars from your villa. The pool was a godsend during our stay! And it's also walking distance from many great restaurants in the area. Do recommend! 🤙

Extremely noisy due to construction and better hotels for money close by. They also tend to allow local Indonesian guests to fill their rooms with family groups which does not add to the serenity and boutique style this hotel once had. Overall extremely disappointed and this hotel is going backwards and needs to change its pricing and fix and update its maintenance.,"I really wanted to score the Respati higher but I can't dismiss our experience in the first couple of days.
Myself and my wife were booked in for 8 nites and at check in everything was good as we were shown to our room up front 2 away from the pool on the second floor...it was a lovely room.
I was aware of the construction going on with the new shopping mall next door but that was not the problem...
Within an hour of settling into our room we experienced loud banging and grinding from below...what they had not told us at check in was they were completely renovating the bottom 5 rooms in this block , the noise was unbearable.
I took videos and went to reception where I was then told yes there was renovation going on but ""only in the afternoon"" , I then asked for how many days was this to continue and was told 2 days no problems.
I requested to be moved to another room which happened to be in the next block , only problem this time the Aircon wasn't working in the new room , after a sleepless night I asked reception to get the Aircon looked at...a maintenance guy came later and spent a hour cleaning it , emptying countless buckets of dirty water into our bathroom sink of all places , the Aircon worked fine after that for the remaining 6 nites .
Breakfast was very good served in the restaurant up overlooking the beach with a egg station and did get very busy in the mornings plus the same selfish guests would get up each morning and place pool towels on the beach sun loungers every day and not return til later , so wrong.
Housekeeping staff were excellent , rooms were very well cleaned and replenished every day.
The other staff we met were very friendly too .
I did notice signs go up around the hotel notifying guests of major renovations on the 5th day and on the 9th day of our check out these renovations were still going with angle grinding , hammering still going on .

Respati is a lovely hotel in a great location with fantastic staff and facilities , I just wish they had of been more honest and upfront with their guests .","Absolutely the best. It’s simply a hidden gem, a little paradise. Everything is at the highest standards. I stayed at Respati for 3 month, and cannot wait to go back. So welcoming and comfortable. The team makes your stay truly memorable. Everyone is sincerely caring and respectful and accommodating. The private hotel beach is amazing. Rooms are spacious and always meticulously cleaned, the mattress and the beddings are better than in most of the luxurious 5 star hotels I’ve stayed. The breakfast is delicious.
Lots of activities in the surrounding area. Walking distance to supermarket and dozens of nice restaurants. The beach walk is to use as a promenade or  for a nice run in the morning, or a nice dinner at the sunset in many restaurants along the beach walk.
The sunrise is breathtaking,
I had such a wonderful time in this place, and want to say thank you to the whole team who made my vacation unforgettable. Very special thank you to Tirta, Yuni, ,Oka,Komang and Wardika.
Thank you to the whole restaurant team who made every breakfast a 5 star experience for me. I’m definitely coming back to Respati.","I enjoyed my stay here. It was on a Sunday, so probably also no construction work nearby. The hotel is situated near the beach, so grab a towel and lay down on one of the beds. The room is spatial and comfortable enough and the shower good. Everything is kept clean.
There is a restaurant with a reasonable menu. Breakfast is also served there with a variety of choices and fresh baked eggs as you want them. The staff is friendly and accommodating.","Very friendly staff, always smiling and greeting, facilities as advertised and beautiful beach access. Central to many attractions with great wellbeing services and eateries nearby"

The regulars are also polite and seem to be having lots of fun. Price is a tad higher, but for the amazing live music performance, it's worth it. The place is rather humid and hot though.

The service was top notch. Me and my son took a cooking lesson one day, so good.","Stayed here for five nights as part of our honeymoon end of March 2024.

Two bedroom villa was very clean and tidy. Flickering light in one bedroom fixed quickly

All staff very friendly & attentive.

Breakfast very good with multiple choices.

The free shuttle can take you to a good private spot on the beach for the hotel. Seafood restaurant nextdoor on the beach good for grabbing a bite to eat and drinks.

Would love to return again in the future.

Many thanks to all the staff who made our honeymoon stay feel so comfortable and special.","Overall we loved our stay.
-Villas are gorgeous. Having an indoor living room was great and unique from other places we had been.
-The outdoor showers were so pretty and peaceful
-Dinner and breakfast were decent. I wouldn't say amazing but nice to have options on site
-We are used to walking everywhere and enjoy doing so. It's less than a 10 min walk to the main street in Sanur. However I would not recommend doing so at night. There were multiple dogs blocking our path and barking incessantly. Use their shuttle instead. The dogs were OK during the day.
-Afternoon tea- substantial snacks and great drink options
-We had one hiccup that really impacted our stay. The cost of laundry was 3-4x other places we stayed. Since we had already done laundry multiple times on the trip and other hotels with comparable price per night, we didn't think to check on the laundry pricing. The bill came to $75 USD for less than half of our clothes. They worked with us to bring the price down some but I would definitely not do your laundry here.","One of the nicest villas in Sanur, Bali that I enjoyed with my family. They have Netflix (it's really nice for staycation and slow-lazy lounging day) and private pool (totally convenience for me and my family). Since we planned to just staying in we also decided to ordered their in room dining, which is pretty nice. However there's a little bit of toilet smells near the outdoor shower (but it's okay since it doesn't spread). At night, there're many frogs sound (i'm not recommending you to swim at night if you afraid of frogs). Totally gonna rate them 4 out of 5.","Great place to stay with friendly staff (special mention to Terri), food and service was top. Clean and specious room, note that the shower is outside but it being private villas didn't bother us."

We can see why it had all the great reviews on google! I am a vegetarian and had many options! We ordered 7 dishes. The price was great and we’re thinking of coming back tomorrow… our last night here in Bali🥰,"The food was not bad (update: however, we got very sick!). Prices are in the higher segment (+250k) which is a bit steep for this quality but still acceptable. Service was friendly. General atmosphere in the restaurant was good. I liked the decorations and overall vibe. Toilets were okay (could be cleaner), everything in the restaurant and kitchen looked hygienic and tidied.

The only things that prevents me from giving it a high score is
1. After eating, my wife and I got very sick at night. It had to be caused by the food from Three Monkeys, as we both only ate two bananas during the day. It decreases 4 stars to 2 stars.
2. the lack of assertiveness of the staff: while a sign at the entrance clearly states that it's a 'non-smoking' restaurant (and we chose it for that specific reason due to my wife being pregnant), some of the guests next to us were ignoring it and still smoking. My pregnant wife was involuntarily passively inhaling their smoke. We notified staff about this, so they could do something about it, and the waiter requested the guests to stop smoking. But they just ignored them, and just lighted another cigarette. This time the staff failed to anticipate and didn't act on this. This was the moment we decided to pay and leave. We skipped dessert and coffee.","Delicious menu, Delicious 😋
So much to enjoy, the drinks, the range of choices for meals, and really yummy desserts. Must try the deconstructed baklava wow!
Best pizzas in Bali by far and lovely place to sit and enjoy Sanur.","We’ve visited Sanur 6 times and always  visit Three Monkeys for dinner. The warm, attentive service is matched by the high quality ingredients. An extensive menu makes sure that everyone is happy.  And there’s an air-conditioned room for those who can’t manage the Bali heat. On a strip where there are many restaurants to choose from, don’t walk past Three Monkeys.","Great dinner here. Started with Sundowner drinks, which are mix & match 2-for-1 within a category - try the Ginger Spice Margarita! The coconut prawns were fantastic, best we've had anywhere. Dinner selections were also great. Nice interior too, highly recommended."

The manager pays attention as says that they get fish and meat fresh every day-that’s what it tasted like. In addition really good prices.
16:00-18:00 Happy Hour - double the wine: 2 glasses in one😁","Great little find of a restaurant! We went in for lunch and the staff were really friendly and we found a bunch of vegetarian choices and non-veg choices. We had the nachos,  vegan nasi campur and bi tutu (chicken) all of which were delicious and very filling. The restaurant staff also entertained our baby so we could really enjoy lunch. Highly recommend!!","We are happy to find this restaurant as its so close to my hotel. They serve some Indonesian foods beside Asian and Western foods. The food is 8/10 but the service is good and it's clean and cozy. The price is affordable. Anyway, It takes a little long to wait for food served but if you have time, that's ok 😊.","""Lilla Warung has become one of my favorite spots in town. I've visited three times now, and each visit has been a delightful culinary experience. The food is consistently delicious, with flavors that transport me to Bali with every bite. The atmosphere adds to the charm, creating a cozy and welcoming environment perfect for enjoying a meal with friends or family. The staff are always friendly and attentive, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. I would highly recommend Lilla Warung to anyone looking for delicious Indonesian cuisine served with a smile."""

Single Origin Iced was so good; we might just have to come back !","This place was in the recommended, yes the coffee is good. But the food is not at all, looks omelet and everything around it absolutely not appetizing, piled a bunch of vegetables that are not even cleaned. Salmon, for which I paid extra in the amount of such, for which you could not charge extra and absolutely unappetizing, I did not even try it. I don't recommend the food. Only coffee.
I recommend that the owner change the concept with breakfasts and serving it.",Incredibile breakfast and coffee this morning. We both had the warm oats and shared a fruit plate. I’ll let the picture speak for itself but I would definitely go back for this breakfast 👌,"Cutest place in Sanur. The food is so delicious and worth the price. The portions are perfect too, I didnt have to force myself to finish the food but I didnt leave hungry. We kept coming back because of how much we enjoy it. The environment is super comfortable and chill too. It doesnt say Halal on the menu but it is, they also use beef bacon instead of real bacon so it was reassuring."

It was very limited and not great quality.","Lovely hotel overall, good location.
Staff were friendly and helpful, always greeted us.
Restaurant dinner expensive for the quality. Breakfast had a good variety of options.
Pool nice, enjoyed swimming between the adjoining pools.","Ok so I’m going to start by saying this hotel is worth way more than 5 stars. The place is truly fantastic. The staff (all of them) are truly beautiful, so happy, welcoming and helpful. The food is amazing, we have spent over a week travelling from North to South Bali and this place is by far the best. Our room is very clean and comfortable and gets cleaned every day. Myself and my husband enjoyed a honeymoon spa treatment today, facial, massage,body scrub and that too was amazing. The staff were so friendly and made you feel very comfortable. Sitting by the pool and reading a book is something we have not done for a long time but this place made it happen. I would like to do a personal shout out Doddy, not only a fantastic waiter but shared genuine care, compassion and interest. Also to Ulan another beautiful waitress who has looked after us throughout our stay, with her warm greeting and easy conversation.","Nice hotel at walking distance from the beach (w 2 beach shuttles per day and own beds), next to many restaurants, with good cleaning services, a comfy bed, friendly staff and lots to choose from at breakfast (continental and balinese).

We booked the cabana (private pool) for 4 nights and extended for another 4 nights. It was no problem to have a babycot placed in our room. The public lagoon pool is also great (9 am to 9pm) with enough shadow during the day for kids. Even tried the spa next to the cabanas, don’t expect too much from the space but their foot massage was definitely good (even better than some yoga spots nearby).

Thanks a lot Gede for being so helpfull with arranging stuff for us (help us find a tailor to fix our travelbags before travelling back) and Amel for entertaining our little baby!

Ps. We read the reviews, so we were a bit affraid of the noise, but it was low season and really quite during the night (even in the back). So we definitely slept well!",Nice and clean. The satay chicken on hot coals is amazing! Only ate there but a friend stayed and we both thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.
