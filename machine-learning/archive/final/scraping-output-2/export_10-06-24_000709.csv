Soup and burger were very delicious.

Thanks for the kindness of Dewi especially!!","I'm not going to sugar coat this.

You are totally paying for a view when you come here. The view is breathtaking but that being said, prices are very high with an added 20% tax at the end.
Drinks come out to 240k IDR each.

The food is very lackluster. I ordered a soup which wasn't bad but also nothing to write home about.

I also ordered two different types of tacos which were disappointing. You get two large tacos per order, however they give you 3 small pieces of meat and then load the whole rest of the taco up with toppings like Pico and guacamole. If you like topping tacos then this is the order for you. Check my photo if you want to see the ratio.

My wife ordered pork belly. She is sensitive to spicy food and on the menu there is a chili next to items with spice. The pork belly doesn't have a chili by it.
They add some sort of very spicy pepper to the soup that accompanies the pork belly and my wife almost threw her meal up after mistakenly eating it. I love spice and ate the other pepper to confirm; very hot.

The drinks were great. We would come back but only for the view and a drink. PLEASE add a chili next to the pork belly so future people won't have their meal ruined like my wife.","Lovely place üíñ Nice food with nice people!
Breakfast wrap & Tikka masala was the best.
Thanks to all, especially to LOVI ü•∞","Thanks Prasetia !
Steak is very delicious, mushroom soup and dessert is also good.
Especially, mood is crazy. I love it!!!!","This hotel is absolutely amazing! Lovi, Setia, bintang and the rest of the staff are really nice, welcoming and attending to your every need! I highly recommend the hotel service, staff and food 10/10 will come back very soon!"
