ChIJ-cO2EV2D0S0R9V5kLGNnTpM,The Aroma Villa Munduk,-8.2590688,114.9962032,"Jl. Mayong-Gunungsari No.88x, Gunungsari, Kec. Seririt, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81153, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=10614535047403036405,OPERATIONAL,+62 822-3663-4111,,lodging,4.9,10,,"We closed our eyes and picked a spot on the map, and found a hidden gold mine!  On arrival at Aroma Villa we were made to feel extremely welcome with fresh fruit and a freshly picked coconut to drink from.  Wayan has created a wonderful and peaceful spot nestled in the middle of rice paddies with an incredible view to the mountains. Having selected a breakfast & dinner inclusion, we have tried local dishes that added to our experience with food from his garden and family farms.  While the local chickens add to the ambiance, they don't ruin the tranquility. While this is a typical Aussie reference, do yourself a favour and book a stay here.  You won't regret it as you will experience real Bali in comfort!","American citizen here who can enthusiastically endorseÂ this not just as a great place to stay, but one of the most unique experiences to be had in Bali. The two things that most stand out are the incredible kindness/giving nature of the owner, as well as the location near Munduk. I also felt like I got a more deep cultural immersion into Balinese way of life by staying here.

Wayan really goes out of his way for villa guests. As there are only two rooms, he essentially gives you undivided attention during your stay. As others mention, usually he will offer you transportation around town in his van since it is a bit more rural. He wanted to take us to a few waterfalls, but when we told him we also wanted to see Ulu Danu Beratan temple, he was extremely kind to drive us there and wait for us in the parking lot while we saw the temple before taking us to the waterfalls for a great hike (the waterfalls he took us to are undoubtely some of the best in Bali, as they still have decent enough infrastructure without being as crowded as some of the other waterfalls). He took us to a hot springs after the waterfall. This was a 6-7 hour day almost, and he doesn't ask for any sort of payment for this; we still tipped him a monetary amount that a full-day driver would usually charge.Â I can't officially promise on his behalf what he will offer, but based on other guests' reviews and my experience, it seems he would offer you help with transportation, whether for a short part of the day or even the full day!

I genuinely think the location on the villa is one of its highlights. If you want to go to partying in clubs/bars, you can still do so, it's just a 20-25 in drive to Munduk city. If you don't care about being in the heart of a city, it is so refreshing being in this villa b/c it is perched next to a rice terrace, and from the comfort of the swimming pool, you can enjoy the incredible beauty of the Munduk countryside with rice terraces.

The room itself is great; spacious, clean, comfortable. If you take the effort to talk to Wayan, he will offer you great insights about Balinese culture. I learned so much talking to him that I wouldn't have learned about if I had just stayed in a large hotel in the city.

Overall, I can summarize this as a genuinely unique experience with a great location and a kind owner who goes out of his way to enrich your experience; and as mentioned, the waterfalls are phenomenal.","We absolutely recommend staying at Villa Aroma in Munduk! The host is one of the nicest person weâ€™ve ever met in this island! As soon as we arrived he brought us a young coconut from his garden to welcome us. Asked us if we wanted to have dinner and at what time and prepared a lovely local dinner for us - it was delicious! Definitely a must try ðŸ˜‹
Then he made sure we had everything we need and explained us why the fruit tastes soooo good here and the fruits he grows in his garden! He gave us some tips on things to do while we are in Munduk and volunteered to take us to the waterfalls, the buddhist temple and the hot springs waters close to the villa. He spent the whole day with us from 10am til 5pm he took us to all 4 waterfalls and waited for us to enjoy our time there. Then he took us to the Buddhist temple and the hot spring waters and asked us to please not rush it and enjoy our time there while he watched out for our stuff. When we went back to the villa he prepared an amazing local dinner for us. In the breakfast he also made sure to include a typical balinese breakfast side so we could experience the real Bali. Wayan is such a genuine person with an amazing energy. If you are thinking about staying in Munduk for a few days to discover a less touristy and more raw part of Bali - you should stay at Villa Aroma 10000%!","I would call this a breathtaking place to spend the night. A beautiful view, a beautiful accommodation and great service. This place is run by a very friendly and helpful owner. We would love to visit this place again sometime.","magical view, really beautiful hotel, amazing service, the host is super nice, i really recommend going there, its worth even driving out of your route for it"
