I come here almost every morning with my 1 year old and we play and have breakfast together. She really likes the Kids platter with scramble eggs and sourdough, they use real butter!

Highly recommend checking it out. They also have an incredibly friendly staff and a caretaker that can oversee and play with your kids while you‚Äôre having lunch or coffee.","Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Nice food.

Definitely a perfect place for the dog lovers. You can meet many dogs here with different breed. They provide food for the hoomans & coffee. Also you can buy dog treats here and share to them. Such a lovely experience! Just come & visit, you'll find your happiness. Woof you! üêæüß°üê∂ - Hiro & the pawrents","I have found my favorite dog park in Bali, where I take my short male Balinese dog, Doko. During Doko's puppyhood, he had difficulties socializing with other dogs and was averse to being sniffed by them, as noted by his previous owner. On my first visit to the dog park, I was apprehensive and entertained numerous negative scenarios in my mind, questioning whether Doko would integrate seamlessly, whether he would bite, cry, and so on.

However, I must commend the staff of Barking Lot for their exceptional work. They carried Doko to the main arena and allowed him to relax and wait for the right moment to release him to the field. I was pleasantly surprised when Doko began to play with Luna, another Bali dog, and I felt relieved and overjoyed that my beloved pet was capable of socializing. Since that time, I have regularly visited Barking Lot. The staff's patience and attentiveness to the dogs' needs have been remarkable, even when Doko was moody due to hormonal changes during his ' 'Teenage Phase' stage. They always ensure Doko's safety and separate him from reactive dogs. Doko is improving his socialization skills, which is gratifying.

Furthermore, I must admit that I cannot get enough of their chicken wings and lychee tea. Every bite is delectable, and you can request to add different sauces, such as mushroom or barbecue.

Therefore, I express my gratitude for the exceptional service at the dog park, and I always feel secure and welcomed whenever I bring Doko there.","The best part about barkinglot is the cleanliness. The staff is super warm and kind. They've been passionate to take care of the dogs. Today, I just had my dog birthday party at barkinglot. Wasn't expected much, but they prepared everything from the mini stage to food very organize and initiative.
Love this place! I would recommend for any fur moms outhere.","A dog park and an outdoor cafe all in one. What a find in the neighborhood, and our puppy loves it with the empty space to run around all over. The best part is they do doggie day care too where you can leave your pet here while you go on with your day, with food and caretakers provided for your baby. The rates are very friendly - at 80K for 6hours and 120K for 12hours, and they do 15% discount for introductory sale.

They are actually open 8am to 8pm for day care, and worth a day visit your doggie for some play fun.",Best doggy day care / on-boarding. Always super friendly and I feel really safe leaving my dog with them when I can‚Äôt take her with me. Also the staff is always welcoming & they send you some cute pictures during their stay!
