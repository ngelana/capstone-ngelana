Only left for order was full ribs, steak, and vegetables.
Ribs was so tender, grilled to perfections and it was amazing!
Basting or ribs sauce was out of this world, slightly sweet and touch of spiciness, perfect!
Pork chop, was delicious even though it was served thinly.
Steak, don‚Äôt ask to cook for your liking, it will come to your table med well- well done, yet still enjoyable!","GOOD GOD, legit one of the best pork ribs I have ever eaten. And at that price to portion ratio? It's practically a STEAL! Tender ribs with a large portion at a cheap price. No wonder the queue can be crazy at times, absolutely worth it though.

Place's super crowded that the waiters can barely attend a table properly at times, the parking spot is located across the road, will take you a 3 minutes walk.

Heard that the owner was a chef at Nurris, another popular pork ribs chain at Bali. IMHO Kayana's much more delicious than Nurris's.

Will return again if I'm visiting Bali.","This restaurant has the best prices for pork ribs, but unfortunately it takes a lot of time to get the food, I waited from 3pm-4.10pm, when I asked and saw it turned out the service was busy serving online food delivery, the place was quite gloomy.  I hope the service and ordering system can be improved again","For 65K, you'll get a LARGE RIB!! And it was really big! If you're willing to wait in line, wait for the food to be served, this is a place for you! I didn't mind the waiting time coz it was worth the wait. I also didn't expect a proper service because clearly it is a local warung (smaller and cheaper than other restaurants). The fall off the bone rib was so flavorful. I even thought of ordering 2 when I go back üòÅ for the price and taste, best rib so far!!","Trying this to celebrate my sister bday. The ribs is delicious espeacially the sauce i really like it not to sweet and their cutlery is good so we can eat easily (which is grateful). The balung soup little bit salty ...i hope they fix that

I ordered the medium size cost 50k while there was large option for 65k

Its a worth to try option when coming to ubud.

Some minus point maybe cuz we came around closing time, their floor seems a bit slippery cuz there are water everywhere and no parking space we park on side of street which maybe in crowded hour will cuz traffic"

We were having a bad day and entering this restaurant instantly made us feel better as the people here are so friendly! We came with our dogs, and the staff even brought a bowl of water for them without us even asking. I highly recommend their tuna base, it's sooo good! One of the best Balinese food I've ever tasted!! A gem in Bali, we'd come again!","Balinese Home Cooking is family owned & operated place serving up flavourful and good local dishes. In addition to indoor seating, they do delivery through Grab as well if you want to have meals sent over to your hotel or villas.

We recently stayed in Ubud and ordered dinner from Balinese Home Cooking through Grab on two occasions. We really enjoyed their Lumpia and Nasi Campur. These were both good, the Nasi Campur was a nice mix of ingredients and tasted great.

More impressive was their Pepes Ikan, a heavily spiced roasted fish that tasted so good. Ordered this dish on both occasions, also liked the Tuna Base Bali style, a heavily spiced grilled tuna that was also good.

Really enjoyed the two meals we had ordered in from Balinese Home Cooking and would gladly order from them or eat at their restaurant again the next time we are in Ubud.","trying out this for the 2nd time. The food is tasty just like the first time I tried.
The waitresses are all friendly and speak english very well.
Unfortunately, due to the restaurant is outdoor, we can find some wild cats around here and they keep watching us. If you are not a cat-lover, you will feel not comfortable. Also, it‚Äôs difficult to find parking lot.",An amazing place with amazing people. Ketut the host is always welcoming everyone as family. He and the staff are kind and engaging.

The owner was very helpful as well and kindly offered to take me and some friends on tours of places which was very appreciated and meant we saw a lot of Ubud in just 2/3 days. Did not use the pool but it looked clean and breakfast was also decent.
Thank you for the pleasant stay!","The actual state of the room, particularly the bathroom, is significantly inferior to what was depicted in the photographs. There is a lack of cleanliness, with the rooms and bathrooms being in a very dirty condition. The service provided is inadequate. The amenities provided are also quite old and unclean. The linens are not clean either. Overall, I encountered issues with the cleanliness and service of the hotel. Additionally, there is a significant presence of mosquitoes. I do not recommend staying at this establishment.","This hotel could be a very nice hotel. If they just kept the maintenance up. The rooms kind of smell mildew. The shower head was broke. I was there for 5 days, and they never fixed it. I love the walk-up stairs and all the foliage. It was definitely a bali feel...................................................................","The hotel is well maintained, it‚Äôs a hidden gem away from the busy road. The room is nice and big, with lots of greens in the surrounding. We can sit in front of the pool to have meal, a well blend to the nature. However the pool needs better cleaning and maintenance.

The road to the hotel entrance is quite narrow and difficult for bigger cars, but other than that it is a great place to stay.","I really don't know about all the other reviews, but we stayed in room on the first floor. It was awful. There was a terrible smell of humidity and mold. It was stuffy and damp. The bed was wet and the room and the bathroom are dirty. There are bugs, ants and cockroaches all over the place. The photos you see online do not show the actual condition of this place.
This place isn't worth any money. So yourself a favor und book somewhere else. It might have been the worst accommodation we have ever been in.

Also when we told them that we don‚Äôt want to stay in that room and asked for a different one, they lied to us telling us there are no other rooms available, while the rooms next to us where empty all the time. Really bad customer service aswell."

Bath tub, bath cubicle and a unique Open shower adjacent to the bathroom. They do not give an extra bed for triple occupancy. No locker / safe, no refrigerator in the  room. They allowed the use of the swimming pool till late at night! Overall, we enjoyed the stay!","Only the rooms are the good part about this resort.

Cons:
1. For veg the breakfast is of no use. Only two items were available in veg: rice and curry and tofu. Veg curry was placed in the same vessel besides non veg curry

2. Staff of the resort is horrible. It seems like the resort is run by few street boys. Half of the time no one is at the reception. No SECURITY at the gate at all (!) Anybody can just walk-in. One evening when we returned, entire staff was sitting near the pool area and relaxing üò≥

3. Location: it‚Äôs very very far from the ubud center - to find a good restaurant you will have to drive atleast 5 kms.

4. Cleaning: On the day of check-in, everything was placed properly but the next day after cleaning the room - they did not place the bed shrug (it was lying somewhere in the corner), the napkin in the bathroom was not folded.",The Awatara Resort had a beautiful pool and courtyard area that was well maintained. The rooms had their own private balcony overlooking the gardens and pool. The rooms were large with a large bathroom and tub. The staff were friendly and well trained.,"My husband and I stayed here for a few days during our honeymoon and it was such an awesome experience. When you stay at Awatara, you truly feel like you are family.

The staff were all so friendly and accommodating. Everyone was so pleasant to speak with. They helped us rent a scooter and had great recommendations for food around the area. They also helped us retrieve items we left in our room after we left and sent them to us. They went above and beyond‚Ä¶ we are so thankful. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ú®‚òÄÔ∏è

On top of that, the rooms were spacious, clean, and stylish. The grounds and the pool area has beautiful landscaping and impeccable upkeep. We were also impressed with the breakfast. Very good!

Also, the location is great! We loved being just outside of the hustle and bustle of busy Ubud but could drop in with our scooter in a matter of minutes. What more could you ask for?

I would give 100 stars if I could. Next time we come to Bali, I will be staying here. We highly recommend it!!

The staff are so cheerful, friendly and kind. The food is presented beautifully and is so yummy!! It‚Äôs perfect!!","Absolutely loved our experience at this place! The ambiance is fantastic with both indoor and outdoor seating options, and we opted for outdoor seating which was spacious and perfect for the kids to have a blast. The food was outstanding; we tried the spring rolls, carbonara, aglio olio, and pizza, all of which were delicious. The menu offers a delightful blend of Western and Balinese cuisine, but we were in the mood for Western dishes, and they certainly didn't disappoint. The pizza was especially fantastic; it disappeared before I even had a chance to snap a photo! Highly recommend this spot for a memorable dining experience.","An incredible hidden delicate dining place where we found west-east cuisine and far away from common tourist areas.

Nice and newly built, spacious and bright. Friendly staffs and good food in this romote place.
My husband insists it should be the best restaurant some kilimeter diameter!

But unfortunately the down sides are at first there is no Parking lot and it located beside in the very dangeous curve narrow and broken mountain street. Be aware of traffic at all time!","Visited this restaurant in Bali and was immediately struck by its aesthetic appeal - truly a beautiful space. The menu presented dishes that looked visually stunning, and when served, the presentation was commendable. However, upon closer inspection, the taste profiles were a bit off. Odd choices like using ketchup for decoration on potato smash and mislabeling ingredients detracted from the experience. For instance, a slice of salty sausage was labeled as ‚Äúsmoked beef‚Äù and a promised ‚ÄúJapanese sauce‚Äù was conspicuously absent from my dish. While the staff was incredibly accommodating, offering soy sauce to add some flavor to the rather dry rice and scrambled egg combo, the taste still felt reminiscent of something I'd whip up late at night post-party. The potato smash with fish was overwhelmingly peppery. For the prices charged, I expected more from the culinary side. With such a gorgeous setting, I truly hope they refine their flavors in the future."

However, since the owner became more involved and started staying around us, the atmosphere took a downturn. It feels like we, as tenants, are no longer able to enjoy the place freely, as the owner closely monitors our every move, leading to frequent complaints. This has created an unpleasant and uncomfortable environment.

About the WiFi network here is not reliable. There are frequent troubles and errors. As a digital nomad, having a strong and stable WiFi connection is crucial for me. The security here is also uncertain; several times, snakes have appeared in the bathroom. The shared kitchen in this place is often dirty and poorly maintained. Power outages are common, and sometimes even the water supply is interrupted. What a paradise!

One more thing to note is that the owner is not particularly friendly towards animals. This happened to a friend of mine; their cat was discarded when my friend was out of town. The reason given was a reluctance to have any cats or dogs to prevent potential damage to the furniture. However, the furniture in the place is not particularly special, and everything is made of sturdy materials. Hence, it seems illogical for cats or dogs to pose a threat to their property.

The staff provides excellent and friendly service, but unfortunately, the owner's presence is not as welcoming. It feels like being surrounded by negative energy when they are around.
Several of my friends who have lived there were once evicted for trivial and unreasonable reasons. So, if the owner doesn't like you, be prepared to be kicked out of their ""paradise."" It's utterly absurd. Therefore, I recommend that if you're looking for a place to stay in Bali, opt for accommodations owned by locals. You will be treated with kindness and friendliness. For instance, my current residence in other side of Ubud is owned by friendly and welcoming Balinese.

This review is completely honest from my perspective no apologies. It is what it is!","Stayed there for a program and being kicked out in the middle of the night by the the management/staff. He had accused my 5 years old to have broken a furniture where he couldn't give proof. A Caucasian man comes in without consent to the bedroom where I am nursing, without knocking and burst out pointing fingers and yelling and even verbally abusing me based on his assumptions.Without even talking to the organiser whom I was invited by, the man undervalued us as guests with his absence of manner.The picture might looked great, but hospitality started with the people running the place. I experienced rudeness and uncivilised treatment from the management while I was there.It smells of pig-farm, where it was located near the compound.","Exceptional.

I wonder how they can claim to have 5 stars as this place is really not working whatsoever. As soon as we arrived they gave us a disgusting room, with a terrible smell: a smaller room - not the one we booked months in advance and paid for. They gave us 3 different rooms, and only a few days before leaving we were moved to the one we actually reserved. This place is far from being clean overall... Most of the plates, cutlery, glasses and cups every morning are stained and dirty. I've ordered the eggs 3 times and I didn't receive anything, as the staff doesn't speak English.

Love the nasi ayam betutu so much and the kindness of the sellers made us feel at home. Went to this place for the second time to break our fast. The lady who served us few days ago, came rushing and greeted us. She already knew our orders but this time I asked whether they have coconut to offer.

She said they didn't sell any coconut there, but she offered to buy it for us. I then asked, whether it is far to get the coconut, cause I didn't want to give such a trouble to her. And she said it was just near by, so I agreed to have them.

I thought it was just next door, turns out she grabbed her motorcycle and went for few minutes to grab them.

She didn't even charge any extra for the coconut. And this delicious nasi ayam betutu komplit, only cost me 20K/plate. That's a five stars product and service that went straight to my heart.

The food was super yummy, the place was comfy and clean, and the service was amazing. We are fans.","This is a nice local place to grab a tasty meal. Friendly staff, fast service and good prices.

I didn‚Äôt know what to expect as it was Ubud, so I thought it would be heaving with tourists (like myself). Luckily the villa is located perfectly out of the way of noise but close enough to head back and forth into the main market area, either by scooter or arranging a taxi.
The villa itself is beautiful and with only a handful of rooms you get a very peaceful experience. We met a few other guests but equally had space to ourselves, which you don‚Äôt normally get (even in places that claim to be peaceful). We wanted to spend as much time at the villa as we did looking around Ubud, and the manager Komang really helped us do just that; helpfully provided ideas for things to do and where to go as well as making our days in the villa relaxing, thank you Komang!
The rooms were also a great blend of traditional and contemporary with lots of light, we‚Äôll air conditioned, and with netted beds.
Each day we received a note on some traditions in Bali which felt like you were in a place that was proud of its culture and history.
Breakfast was also provided each day by friendly staff who were very attentive and calm.
The pool is a decent size for a relaxing swim, and you may be lucky to have a room that is a few steps away.
We had a chance to meet the owners who were very friendly and cared about your stay.
My wife and I felt very relaxed at the villa and would pick it as our first choice when we return to Bali.","Cozy villa very close to ubud, great place to rest after long days of sightseeing! Nicest staff, will help with everything - tours, dinners, taxi - always with a smile on their faces.","We were on a wander around the area hoping to grab some breakfast and stumbled upon Villa Saraswati. They just so happened to have one day inbetween guests leaving and guests arriving, so kindly spun up a beautiful breakfast for seven people. Absolutely beautiful location sitting at the handcarved table overlooking the pool and temple beyond. The breakfast was perfect and exactly what we were looking for, so good we came back again the next day! We appreciate they don't usually offer this to those who arent guests.

We will definitely come back and this time to stay a few days. A hidden gem in the real Ubud. Thank you Robyn, Komang and the staff at Villa Saraswati!","Excellent room and grounds. Hotel manager and staff are very helpful, friendly, and inviting. Easy to have trips planned around ubud. Relaxing environment.",Fantastic staff and an amazing little paradise to stay in away from the hustle of the centre of ubud.

Then better you owner you will understand that his is good guy.","A true gem. Wayan and his family are absolutely lovely. The home is beautiful, peaceful, quiet and gorgeous. Beautiful, comfortable canopy bed with nice bathroom and outdoor shower. His wife makes delicious pancakes and vegetarian food. They also offered my fresh tea and fruit. His sister in law can come do massage in your room and she was phenomenal. Wayan picked me up at the airport and offered to generously take me all over town. He is so genuinely excited to share his home and country with others and he loves meeting people from around the world. This was the most beautiful, relaxing stay and I would give them 100 stars if I could. Thank you Thank you Wayan and family!"

Putu and Cherry really took care of us. They were like a family to us. Amazing view. The kitchen is overlooking the pool and huge trees. Very cozy and spacious house. The beautiful garden adds to the great experience!,"This is a beautiful private Villa, spacious and well-built. It is clean and comfortable. From the rooms above you have beautiful views of tall trees and lush jungle with a large terrace for yoga and dining. Downstairs there are lounge chairs, a garden where you can eat and a private pool which is well-maintained. The open kitchen is a dream! It's fully equipped with two fridges and cooking utensils.

The hosts, Cherry and Putu, are exceptional and dedicated to making your stay pleasant. Cherry is a terrific cook and Putu will drive you to any destination .  We had a long stay here and highly recommend it.","What a fantastic experience! The food and service are exceptional, the value incredible. We had a family meal for 5 and all of us would happily return again and again.","The place was terrible. Fungus at all of the walls and in AC, cockroachs in all bathrooms. Pool was dirty and we got allergic reaction after swimming there. Please do not stay there!!!","Nice & clean villa.. The owner & the staff is very friendly..

The open entrance to the house makes it very damp. It wasn't as clean as we would have liked with left over noodles in the sink from a previous guest and because of a previous bug issue they had moth balls in the bedrooms and bathrooms which made it smell very strong.

The driveway is very broken with big chunks of loose concrete on a steep section which can be very challenging for scooters. The pool was very cold but it is a jungle location with lots of trees around.

The little things were missing for us.

Extra towels, rubbish bins in the bathrooms, house keeping (we had to request it), timeliness when they said they would drop off supplies (we had to follow them up when they didn't turn up)...

They were slow to check out problems like a leaking water cooler in the kitchen which left the floor slippery and dangerous for unsuspecting passers by. They never did anything but reply to my request to fix it but no action was taken.

It could have been cleaner. We found an empty sprite bottle under the couch and could see it had not been cleaned properly.

The one tea towel we were given had stains all over it and there was an obvious stain on the sheet on our bed and a ripped sheet on another bed.

It is very close to other villas and we could hear people partying next door at 1 in the morning.

Sadly we left after 24 hrs and would not stay again. There was no offer for a refund.","We had a blast staying in this authentic and yet mordernize villa,,the people are warm and kind eapecial mention to Ms Yulie the owner of Villa Ubud Arya she is kind and accommodating and  we want to thank you Ms Yulie for the best sambal balinese food she did for us...
