Both using a scooter, riding slowly through the village road. Inevitably i got heron poop on myself, but the experience was very exhilarating nonetheless. There were hundreds of them herons just hanging out on the roadside trees.","There are three places to watch the herons from, two of which serve drinks and are very relaxing, the watchpoint 3 would be best for any visiting that have accessibility requirements as there is a wider staircase at the watchpoint. The heron land in all the trees in the village at times around sunset - there is hundreds of them. Literally 100s.","Even if you are not a birder it is impressive to visit Petulu at sunset and watch the 400,000 herons come in to roost in the trees around this village. There are three species of herons that roost here and locals can help point them out to you.","So we walked from our hotel in ubud to go see the herons.. we paused a taxi driver who said that the herons won't be there as they were off out on the hunt for food. We nearly turned back, but as we were most of the way there, we carried on
We found the stairs up to the viewing platform where there were benches to sit on.   We didn't see any herons initially as we were looking in the wrong place. If you look to the left,that's where the herons are. Up in the tops of the trees.There wasn't many but enough to satisfy us. Whether more would be there at dawn/dusk, I don't know
It was a nice walk there but take drinks as there's not a lot around...","You will see a lot of herons srriving home for the night. Nothing special unless you are a Bird enthusiast üòú

We stayed in one of the treehouses which was clean and spacious. Homemade breakfast everyday and you can order dinner too, if you want. Since we had a lovely view of the ‚Äòjungle‚Äô from our balcony, I expected to be bothered a lot by mosquitoes or other insects, but this was not the case at all.

What made our stay so great, was because of the sweet family hosting the place. They were so welcoming and caring. I‚Äôve been to Ubud many times and stayed at various places, but I will for sure come back to this place going forward.

It‚Äôs a bit outside of the city centre (which we wanted), but not that far by bike or car. Alang-Alang offers scooter rental, laundry and massages (of which we made use of) for decent prices.","Highly recommended. Very accommodating staff/family here. The tree house style rooms are amazing. Big comfy beds with nice pillows, and they back onto jungle which is great to fall asleep to the noises. Food is homemade and you get room service which is a bonus. Getting a couples massage today which we're looking forward to! üòå",Great! Staff is so friendly and helpful. They give you good advice and are warm and welcoming. We got breakfast on our balcony every day. The room is adventurous  but it's all clean. The garden and pool are well maintained. If you don't have a deep sleep bring ear plugs because of the roosters and dogs (from outside the accomodation) in the morning. I can only recommend staying here.,"The family who run Alang Alang House made our stay here really special and wonderful. They work hard to ensure you have a really great stay and we really loved our week at Alang Alang House. Our treehouse was beautiful and cleaned daily, our breakfast was bought up every morning and we made sure to enjoy the pool most days too. If you're looking for an authentic treehouse experience then I couldn't recommend Alang Alang House enough!","Only if I could remove the sound of Gecko from my ears and the sight of it on the wall of my room, could I have given this place an extra star..

Nonetheless, Good place to stay in Ubud. It is about 4 kms away from the main market aka the very buzzing and lively Monkey Forest street. You have limited options for breakfast here. They do provide laundry service here and at very cheap rates.. They also provide transportation service if you need.

They have a nifty little pool. Good to use.

You can do Mt.Batur trek through this place, it is about an hour away from this place. Must visit."

Lovely place to stop. Very beautiful garden with birds in it walking around - the ones which are in the clinic. Friendly owner who explains you everything about the birds, and they prepared delocius meal and drinks for good price. At the time we were alone in the cafe, which is also good that is not overcrowded, you can get some peace around Ubud :)","This is one of the most authentic wildlife experience I‚Äôve come across in Bali. The people are doing the work for the love for the birds‚Ä¶ they rescue baby birds that fall off the nests during the nesting season, and breed them to adulthood, and release them‚Ä¶ and continue to support those that come back with injuries and food‚Ä¶
We can support this work through eating at the cafe and donating to the box! Bird feeding is available if you are there at feeding times! The food is also very good and prepared at ordering!!
Well worth a car ride there!!","Very lovely small place, in which the (rescued) herons get food and can recover. The staff let us feed the birds and told us a lot about the birds. Very interesting. It is running on donations and there is a bar with food and drinks, though there is no pressure from the staff, which makes it feel relaxed and authentic.","This is bird rescue center . The colony of cuttle egrets , generally around October coming back for laying eggs, is nearby.
It's run by compassionate caring heart.
Though Menu seems bit costy, it's for supporting entire syatem. Even reasonable handcraft as cutleries or cool design accessories are available.

It's also environmental studying place."

There are just a few minor issues. The water system pressure is too strong, and unfortunately, I got room no.1, where the bed is located next to my neighbor's kitchen.

I can't paint at all, but it didn't matter because it wasn't about painting, it was instead about expressing your emotions through abstract painting. Puhan delivered the session with much patience and kindness, conveying all the instructions and caring for all the participants. I learned a lot about letting go, embracing my inner child, being non-judgmental, having empathy, and showing respect.

Something to be improved: I feel it would be better if Puhan explained the psychological concept behind choice of colors and patterns.
