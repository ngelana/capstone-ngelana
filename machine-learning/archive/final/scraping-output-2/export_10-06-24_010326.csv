Cons:
- No kettle in the room, so it's pretty annoying when you want to make some coffee or tea
- TV doesn't work or only shows MTV channel but really bad reception.

I stay for 4 night, all my breakfast was not varied, just fried rice and fried noodle.. only fried rice and noodle..

I just like the cheese and the desserts, it's served in a small cup, just a perfect size for not feeling too rich. Pity that many times they run out of it. My favorite is the Tiramisu Cake and the Lemon Curd Cheese Cake flavor after the BBQ Cheesy Wedges. I used to order from Gofood as my first visit to the outlet wasn't a good experience. A very long queue with one counter serving the customers and was extremely slow too.","The fried chicken isn't special, even with cheese. I think it will be better if they use mozarella. I tried the hot chicken level 5th, I think the spicy taste come from pepper, this feels a little different from the spicy flavor of the chili. The strawbery milk is good.
