Food was just average. Price isn‚Äôt the cheapest but it was acceptable for the atmosphere.

Biggest downside were the sand flies and mosquitoes while we had our meal. We ended up having lots of bites.

Unlikely to return.",The restaurant is nice. It has a parking lot outside before walk along the paddy fields. Everyone of staff is friendly and helpful. The food is tasty. Great!,"I will visit Greenkubu every time I'm in Bali!!

I had a huge lunch and it didn't disappoint breaded wings, katsu sushi, beef ramen. Every bit was amazing. Especially enjoyed the sushi.

Had to leave in a hurry but I can't say how much I wanted to use the swing and sky bike.

Thanks to all the great staff for a wonderful lunch.","I‚Äôve been visiting this place since 2023.
This is very chill and full of experiences place. Good food, some options are my fav that I take over and over again.

Coffee cappuccino ‚òïÔ∏è is also good here and comes with a donut üç©

My Top dishes:
Chicken Parmigiana
Nicoise salad
Corn and shrimp soup
Mushroom cream soup
Chicken pesto bruschetta","It was first day at Bali and was a long day visiting various locations in Bali by drive and by walk.  Our tour guide took us to this restaurant for dinner.  When we reached parking, we were like concerned about the location, the dinner options etc‚Ä¶ Every step we walked forward was just a bliss.  It‚Äôs really a cool setting.  Rice fields to the side of pathway leading to the restaurant.  Great ambience that mezmerized us.  It was a defined set menu for us, we also ordered few a-la-carte items as well.  Food was excellent, staff and service was top notch.   Looks like the view during day would be good as well, with an option to use swing.  But the evening ambience was just awesome.  Recommend GreenKubu at Ubud."

Though Gede served us very well also helped in nearby unexplored places with less crowds during season time. They also arrange scooters and on demand they can arrange trips too. Overall a very good place to stay in ubud- Bali.,"The location is ok, the garden and the pool create a beautiful landscape but that is it.

- the pool was not that clean and no room for 6 people to stay confortable
- a lot of crawlers inside the rooms and bathrooms. VERY BIG CRAWLERS: spiders, cockroaches, lizards
- no fridge and no services to provide any kind of beverage
- not a lot of restaurants in the area. We found one and just took our breakfast there ( 10 to 15 minutes of walking )
- no hot water in two of the bungalos ( we rented 3 )
- the rooms were pretty dark even with the lights on
- the bathrooms were very very unclean. We had to go and buy produce to clean them and desinfect.",The place is nice but they need to work on the service!,Amazing. Unfortunitely we only got to stay one night but this place is a gem and for a great price. Beautiful

Well organized, informative and we saw stunning scenery. Kerak, our tour guide answered all our questions about Bali and the Balinese way of life and we cycled through villages, past schools and temples and all along the magnificent irrigation system bringing water and life to the rice terraces. Our breakfast overlooking Mt Batur was delicious and lunch was even better.
I highly recommend this tour.","Absolutely loved this tour! Lovely driver and guide, beautiful scenery and what felt like an authentic experience. We tasted great coffee, got a feel for nature and met some beautiful locals away from the hustle and bustle of touristy areas. This was a great way to be a tourist without feeling like you are taking more than you are giving. Would definitely do this again and love this local, family owned company.","Package of schedules that this tour provides worth every penny I paid and every second I spent. It contains some well-known experiences like observing Tegalanglang, tasting luwak coffee and having meal in front of mt Batur.

However, this tour also features some rare experiences like visiting truly local family house(so local that I didnt take single picture of it to respect their privacy), riding a bike along the narrow pathways in the local ricefield terrace(not just watching down on the viewpoint). Shoes went dirty as we drove through the muddy roads and clothes got sweaty as we pushed through some uphills(fyi, most of the riding path were downhills), but the memories that I had during the tour are still so vivid even after few days had passed.

At the end of the tour, they provided late lunch as a buffet(chicken sate, nasi goreng and some fried dumplings) at the endpoint. To be honest, this nasi goreng was one of the best dishes I had in this travel.

This was 10/10 experience. So grateful that I was part of it.","With ""Love Bali Bike Tours"" we made a tour near Ubud.  We drove past several beautiful places and stopped at beautiful locations. We visited beautiful rice fields and a traditional house, which was very interesting. We were allowed to taste local food and the different local teas and coffees at a local plantation. Our guide was very friendly, knowledgeable, and took us into the beautiful culture of Bali.  The explanation of the guide was very good and there was enough time to ask questions. Also he was a very good photographer! Breakfast and lunch were both delicious. We enjoyed the tour very much and would recommend it highly to anyone!",We had the best time on this trip! Excellent value for money. Was wonderful seeing rural Bali and how people live. A pleasant ride through the country with amazing food to finish! Could not reccomend enough excellent and very friendly hosts üòäüíì
