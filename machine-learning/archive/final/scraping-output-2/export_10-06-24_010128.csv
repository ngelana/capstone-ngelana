The room is clean, bed comfy and views to a ricefield. It is in a quiet area, but still close to Canggu if you need to go to any of its coworking spaces. Very convenient. If I come back to Canggu I'll book it again","This hotel is an excellent value for the price. I was honestly expecting it to be very bare bones and minimal cleanliness for the bargain price, but it was a good accommodation. The room was pretty clean, the beds and bathroom felt clean and fresh. The shower water did get hot and the AC worked well. There was even a TV with Netflix! It was a small room but had 2 bedside tables to put things on. We saw a few trails of ants leading to the bathroom trash bin, and a few in the room, but not a huge problem. Bugs can easily get in from the ""windows"" that are basically holes in the wall with plastic taped poorly over them, but surprisingly we never had any issues with mosquitoes coming in at night. (We aimed the AC fan right on us to deter bugs) It was easy to find. Unfortunately we were also right next to the lobby and it got very loud at night sometimes if people decided to hang out. Very easy to hear everything that people are saying if they're within 20 meters of the door. A bit far from the things we wanted to do in Canggu but easy to reach with a motorbike. Overall would definitely recommend this place!","Room is adequately comfortable. Staff are pretty unfriendly and unhelpful. On my first day of check in, there wasn‚Äôt anybody and I had to spend time contacting the staff. They were also very slow in their response on their whatsapp and do ignore most times. My bathroom drainage was clogged and not even clear when I entered.","To any concerned reader :) !

The hotel was very welcoming, prepared and professional. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Each room has it own seating area with a beautiful view.

Late at night If you need anything there is a bell to ring and the hotel is flexible with check in and check out times. If you want food, They also have a restaurant a very short walk away or you can order it to you‚Äôre room.
The hotel is with in short drive of everything you need and you can rent a bike from the hotel, get a taxi or a grab. As you can tell by my review I was over the moon with this hotel and I would highly recommend and will also be coming back.

Thank you again for my wonderful stay.",Clean rooms. Good airco. Great value for money. Deducted 2 stars because the cab driver arranged by the hotel tried to scam us into paying 400k for a 50k ride. Also were rude the day of check out for no reason. Still great value for money tho.

The clams with that special sauce was mindblowingly good!! The sauce was sweet, salty and smoky! We started with one plate and had a total of 6 plates by the end of our evening. We also had grilled fish, grilled prawns and some fish head soup. Everything was fresh, delicious and so affordable.

Ambience was great! Paddy fields in front of you with almost no traffic noise from the surrounding. This place is definitely worth a special trip there.","Not so many choices of food.

My favs are Sundubu jjigae (perfect for rainy days) and spicy chicken. Sometimes i buy their kimchi too for cooking at home. It's so good and worth the price, better than supermarket bought.
What i appreciate is the owner takes feedback seriously. The best korean restaurant in the area.","Seafood sundubu-jjigae was my fav! You should try it out. Well seasoned, balanced taste, yummy! The spicy beef was good too and a lot of condiment. The staff and owner was very friendly and have a homey atmosphere, cute details.","A beautiful Balinese soul cooking Korean food in munggu‚Ä¶  since moving to Kedungu area, I‚Äôve been reluctant to go all the way to pererenan for my Korean food fix, especially with all the rain these days.  So I pope‚Äôs invite to the little Korean kitchen with little expectation and was surprised to find a gem of a place where Korean food was given an Indonesian twist that was satisfying.

I was skeptical when I saw dolsot bibimbap on the menu‚Ä¶ meaning stone bowl bibimbap. I asked to be sure it was and was reassured it will be a hot stone bowl. It turned out it was a hot stone bowl but not the typical ones you see in Korea. But it was ok, because the bowl was hot enough to make the rice crispy and stick to the bowl to make  nuerenge.   I love this as we add water and make rice soup ‚Ä¶. Yummmmmm. See picture.

The bowl was a bit small and so the vegetables were mostly cooked and while different when mixed with jochojang, it was very good. They provided 3  banchans, kimchi, pickled cucumbers and savory potato. It was not blanched as well as it could to be a bit more crispy but it was good enough to satisfy my Korean food craving.

Then the Korean pancake ‚Ä¶. I could not finish it all but it was good.  I think it can be a little more crispy and maybe adding kimchi or so thing else to give it a more distinct flavor would make it outstanding but it is a new dish they added and I am sure it will evolve into something that is distinctly Indonesian Korean food.

That is what make this place great.  It‚Äôs Korean food but twisted for the local taste.  I‚Äôve rated Korean food all over the world and it‚Äôs never the same. It‚Äôs always best when it‚Äôs unexpectedly blended with the love of another culture.  Well done lovely lady. Your Seoul speaks Korean but your heart is baliüòç","Best authentic Korean food with good prices! You can ask for less spicy or more spicy for your jiggae. Nice banchan too. I used to eat Korean food at Pererenan but here is better. Just a bit hot, no AC.","I was not in the good condition, but this Korean food cures me!
Kimchi Jjigae tastes like a real Korean one. They follows recipes very well. Best Korean food you can get in Canggu area."

Chairs & table were not.  Bathroom lacks basic amenities like shelf/cabinet space, feels like a prison.  Lacks proper closet/cabinet.

Value for $ is poor.  Canggu guesthouse/villa prices, in spite being located 20min outside.  Area is relatively quiet and residential, except around public holidays where there will be loud noises/music/dance late into the early morning (Balinese tradition however, so there's no changing that).

Workers lacked tact and professionalism.  Manager falsely claimed minimum stay was a month, while my neighbors were a revolving door of tourist short-term stays. Then would send a message last minute saying rent was going up every month (without reason).  Definitely tried to take advantage of the fact I was an American tourist - other residents didn't receive such treatment.

One neighbor was a creep, walking in common areas his underwear or sitting outside, staring at myself and other residents, making us all feel uncomfortable.  Then verbally harassed me during his last week. Definitely lock your doors and hide your belongings if you stay here, given the tenants can be a bit sketch.

The guesthouse is near Seseh, a really nice residential area that has everything you need nearby.  Highly recommend the area, but not this guest house.","I love this place! I lived here for 3 months and think it‚Äôs the perfect spot. The rooms are big, very clean, and so comfortable. There‚Äôs a TV which has its own channels or you can hook up your laptop with a HDMI cable. The AC is good, and the bathroom has hot water and is, again, very clean. There‚Äôs a shared kitchen, with microwave, stove, utensils, crockery and cutlery, as well as a fridge and free water (hot and cold). The courtyard has enough room for bikes and each room has chairs outside and a drying rack.
The owner is clear in communication on WhatsApp and the Komang (staff) is very helpful and friendly.
The location is perfect in my opinion, it‚Äôs down a small lane off the main road so it‚Äôs quiet. There‚Äôs lots of local warungs around, but it‚Äôs only a 10-15 minute drive into central Canggu if you need to go in.

I ordered the burrito bowl, overall the taste was pretty decent, it was not a classic Mexican take. What are the things that I question was the use of carrots in the vegetable ingredients (which I don‚Äôt think it is usually used). I was also expecting a fresh vibrant dish with mix of cold vegetables on top of hot rice and meat, however, they actually cooked the vegetables as well. Also felt like it wasn‚Äôt a classic take to the dish. and finally they drizzled a lot of mayonnaise type sauces that was unnecessary and creating a tasty meal; matter fact that actually ruined it in my opinion.","It is really hard to find good Mexican food anywhere outside Mexico, but this place really comes close, with their own twist (and is so much better than some of the other options in Canggu, *cough cough* Lola's).

Such a cute little place, a bit rogue but the sushi rolls are worth it!

We tried the Spider Crunch Roll, Spicy Tuna, and their best seller Kuta beach roll. 24 pieces of rolls between 2 of us. Looked a bit heavy at first but it was so tasty that we smashed it all!

Didn't even stop to take photos till there were only one or two pieces left! Not the best photos but believe me, so tasty!

Must visit! Super friendly staff as well! So sweet!!!",Highly recommend one cheap place to eat sushi in Bali. We went here for dinner and ended spending 100k per person with five dishes. My favourite was the tempura sushi. Though the place doesn‚Äôt have an ambience to dine in but taste and value for money is icing on the cake. I would definitely come here again for the yummiest sushi in Town. Not to forget the owners are the sweetest and serve the sushi real quick.,"At first, my friends and I were not really sure to try Sushitoo. But knowing this place has good reviews, we decided to go in.

The place is more like local eatery, but boy, the sushi here are good and fresh! We started with 2 plates, ended up with many more. We kept ordering. I couldn‚Äôt remember the names of their best selling sushi, but remember the numbers on the menu - 24,27,28!

Don‚Äôt hesitate to try. Thank me later!"

It's pretty far from everywhere but the trip is worth it. Delicious and comforting. Pair it with the fresh sugar cane juice definitely will bring you back to Malaysia.,"Great cozy spot serving AMAZING Malay food. The laksa is tasty with ample prawn and the soup is not too heavy. We ordered small bites (otak-otak and wings). Wings were crispy on the outside yet juicy and meaty; otak-otak also rich in flavor. Es Cendol was a great way to close the meal, not too sweet and the jelly is soft and chewy. We also met and had a chat with the owner who‚Äôs very friendly and welcoming. This is definitely the place to go if you‚Äôre looking for authentic, homey Malay food. I‚Äôm definitely going back there again.","I like it always improved, the broth the dishes the place. Laksa is my go to dish! ‚ú®","I love restaurant that knows which products they are excelling in to the T and sticks by it. Yes Madam is doing exactly that.

The laksa is fresh, the soup is light and delicious. The prawns are succulent and sweet, the tofu is exactly like how I remember it.

The fried chicken is unlike anything I ever had before. Perfectly seasoned to the bone, generous in spices and flavour.

I like the portion tho, it is not too big so you won‚Äôt overeat. In fact it is just nice for you to order the whole menu.

Don‚Äôt forget to order their es cendol, it taste clean, the brown sugar is rich and aromatic.

I highly recommend this place, it is unlike any other place and definitely worth visiting.","This place is too good! Feels like you can carry on with your day with no lag. Refreshing dishes w/ creative recipes.
Zero competition when it comes to Laksa. Hands down the best!
It‚Äôs not good Laksa if it isn‚Äôt sitting on a bright orange table, yes Madam."
