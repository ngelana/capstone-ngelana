Even though we brought our own sarongs and wore polite clothes with trousers below the knee. We were not allowed to enter the temple area and only outside the temple. There was only a little to see, then we went home and there was a parking attendant asking for 10k for a motorbike.","On the top of Nusa Penida island. Be there once you visit Nusa Penida, it offers nice surrounding view. Sacred place too if you want to worship Hindu Gods.","Oldest temple in Nusa Penida Island. Entry is free for all. But need to rent a Sarong from unauthorised personal roaming around the temple at a cost of Rp20K.

Beautiful surroundings. Very peaceful area. Small restaurants available nearby.",Best vegan kitchen in the Island! Beautiful people and great service,"Give it a 5 star not for the temple (which is nice) but for the way up there with its magical views. The road is good all the way to the top. Guess because the road was made for the windmihlls, which are sadly abbandomed.  Very recomend√© drive. A bit steep in some parts, so if it's your first time on a scooter, maybe not the best thing."

Katon Hills is simply spectacular ‚Äì and so intimate: three comfortable, modern, well-furnished rooms only, up a secluded hill, on the fringes of a tiny traditional village ‚Ä¶ you can pass days without encountering another traveller, and truly connect to nature. The communal pool (if you can call it that, given that you‚Äôll likely enjoy complete privacy with a maximum of four other guests staying!) is perched at the edge of the hill, offering splendid sunset views that will melt the iciest of hearts. Solid breakfast, Oh, and the service ‚Äì Juliana and the team are smart, friendly, attentive, but also discreet, and gave our room a lovely personalised message we will remember for the rest of our lives. Truly an unrivalled spot on Penida or, frankly, anywhere.",We had a lovely stay at Katon Hills. The view was spectacular and so was the pool. Quiet place with decent and cozy rooms. The host and staff were friendly and great. They were available all the time for anything we needed and the service was on point. It was centrally located so everything was convenient within 25-40 mins by motorbike (which they also arranged for us). The host also gave us a list of short listed places around that made our trip easier. Will definitely stay there if we visit again!,Not good place no one on front desk nothing near no food no water don‚Äôt pay before you see like me i will never recommend this property Ac is not working pool is soo dirty,"Very nice place, with very friendly people. we stayed there in march and enjoyed the silence & view there!
Just make sure to rent a bike if u can, or get a taxi driver to drive you all around. The host will help you to get whatever you need","Central location with a beautifull view. Cottages are simpel but ok. The shower is lacking water pressure. Would be convenient if there is more space to hang some clothes/towels and if there is a hairdryer.
Breakfast is fine, choice of 3 dishes with coffee and fruit.
You can rent a scooter. Great response of contact via Whatsapp.

When you rent a cottage please give some love to the dog, Sjors. He protects your cottage the whole night and he is really sweet. üòÄ"
