I had a great lunch here, the service was fast and the food fresh and tasty! Yeah it's a bit pricey but I can't complain. I had the Veg Talli",They had no roti option and only nan was available. Food is okay okay for the price which you pay. On top of it taxes out are flat 25%. Go here only here if you extremely crave for Indian food. But there are much better Indian restaurants at other places of Bali.,"I & my wife Here in Bali and itâ€™s day 3 , we were in search of good Indian restaurant and must say Khana Khazana has fulfill our wish.Food awesome ; service very quick , felt as if we in India ; thank you for the yummy food. We are amazed for their service. U guys rock.","Overpriced, with poor service and food is on the below average to average scale. Only have very few items albeit mentioning almost everything on the menu. Save yourself, try not to go.
And a message to the management, improve your service when you're levying an 18% combined tax over for the same.",Me and my whole family were at dinner. We know how delicious Indian cuisine can be in Bali. There is no such thing here. There was no milk or cream in the sauce. Regular tomato paste. The paneer cheese was tasty though. We asked for it not spicy and without onions. They brought us spicy food with onions. Twice. And they tried to convince us that it was not an onion. And itâ€™s unclear why prices are so high for such food. For this price we eat at much better Indian restaurants in Canggu and Nusa Dua. And on top of the already high prices they add 18% tax and services. It is very unlikely that we will eat here a second time.

The worst service ever. Asked for NORMAL RICE, then this lady said normal is basmati, we were so confused, we asked more NORMAL RICE AGAIN, even though on the menu, there are two options for rice, she never showed us or tell us anything. It was our fault for not looking through the rice menu carefully, after asking for normal rice, the lady kept saying Basmati?? Basmati ??? THERE WAS NORMAL RICE IN THE MENU NOT BASMATI. Later charged us 89K for rice. Total order was 400 K when all we ordered was rice, curry, and naan. Later clocked that the lady just want to charge us more thatâ€™s why she kept saying basmati instead of just offering the normal rice. Never coming here again, never would recommend this place ever.",,,,
