Ordered a latte in restaurant for breakfast which we paid for. No problem. But 60,500 (A$6) for a mediocre cappuccino instead of latte is daylight robbery.

Came here after booking a dolphin tour with them (once in a lifetime experience) going to come back a few times before we leave!,"Nice people, good atmosphere but honestly I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. We ordered  grilled fish for two, and it didn‚Äôt worth the price. Fish was frozen and not tasty at all. The rest of the food was fried and portions really poor for 2 ppl. The only thing the we liked was the tuna skewers. Even fruit was not that good. We choose the place cause of the positive reviews, but honestly I don‚Äôt understand why. Maybe we‚Äôve just got unlucky. If you are looking for fresh fish is not the right place."
