Cocoa II No.77, Kedewatan, Kecamatan Ubud, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80571, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=5920826660707789004,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 972715,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.3,865,,"We stayed in a pool villa. We had a huge room & bathroom, large, four poster with net curtains (which worked well for mosquitoes/bugs), safe, fridge, kettle + drinks. Our private pool was a small infinity, very nice, with seating area and views over the jungle behind the hotel area.
There was a larger pool near the bar and restaurant area as well as an on-site spa which we didn't try (it's cheaper to get massages in Ubud). Breakfast was excellent, with a wide selection of foods, eggs cooked to order. Coffee was local & great. We did have room service one evening, and what we had was fine if expensive.
The location is down to personal taste. Because it's a little way out from the centre of Ubud, it's much more peaceful. However, it means that you need transport to go anywhere. There's a shuttle four times a day from the hotel into the town centre, but the last return is 8pm so you may need to take taxis of an evening if you're out.
Service was excellent.","Worst hotel we ever stayed at. This hotel put a dampener on our experience in Bali thus far. The room we paid for was a villa with an outdoor bath and shower cubicle. The shower cubicle was full of insects and critters and was similar to a shower from I'm a celebrity.

Our room had 3 lizards, ants and bugs in the bed. This was the moment we decided to leave. The staff were particularly unhelpful and told us we are in a jungle and that was normal.

Bugs in the bedsheet is not normal in any country. We left for a better hotel near Ubud central but will warn people please don't stay at this hotel. Poor staff and  overpriced rooms filled with jungle residents...","Myself and my family really enjoyed our stay at this resort. We have a two year old girl who loved to look at all the fish they have in the ponds, anytime she did the staff would bring some food so she could feed them. All the staff were friendly and helpful to us, In particular a young man called Widi was always one to make sure we were happy with everything. The resort itself has the jungly vibe away from the busstle of other areas. I would definitely recommend this place for families that want a nice chilled holiday. SUKSMA üôè",It's a beautiful villa resort and we had a unique experience with a private pool. But the ac provided was too small for such a big room. Our friends also felt the same. We were a group of 9 in four villas. Each villa is different. In some villas the maintenance of restrooms were not up to the mark. The food was good. Indian cuisine was also available and quite good too. The buggy service inside resort provided was prompt and very helpful . On the whole it was a memorable and cherishable experience.,"Probably the best place to stay in Ubud. From check in to check out, everything was smooth. The rooms are spacious and cozy with private pool option. The food served has a lot of options. You have no disturbance from outside."

We booked a royal pool villa room for 3 nights (directly through their website) and when we showed up they put us in a totally different room.  One night was prepaid and they then made us pay upfront for the remaining nights. We then found out that they didn‚Äôt even have one night to put us in the room we booked. The presidential two bedroom suite is what we were given. The entrance is right off the lobby and common area, not private/quieter entrances like all the other rooms. They locked one of the bedrooms so we didn‚Äôt even have access to the whole suite. The bedroom we had was incredibly small and the bathroom right next to the bed. There was an outdoor jacuzzi that we did not want. There was all this outdoor space- dark, humid, and buggy. The suite did have a small pool, but it was NOT PRIVATE. It was in direct line of sight of the public pool above. You could hear people walking and talking, not to mention people were looking over the edge directly down at our pool. Not relaxing or private at all.

They claimed they were upgrading us but when you look on their website the room they put us in is significantly cheaper than royal pool villa. The room we were put in was amenity and cost wise cheaper. They claimed they were upgrading us to give us a jacuzzi- we did not want that. Whether they overbooked the room or something happened, they handled the situation awfully! They tried to cover up and lied to us. They should have asked us- don‚Äôt assume, ask your guests if you are going to change the room on them! It‚Äôs still shocking that they could do this to their guests, especially those on their honeymoon.

There are so many other hotels with private pools nearby and who have much better customer service. Do not risk having your trip ruined. DO NOT STAY HERE","The resort is absolutely amazing! The room was great, and the view breathtaking! All the staff are very polite, positive and smiley, and make your stay very pleasant.
There is absolutely only good thing to say about this resort!!
However, one thing I need to point out which justifies the 4 star - is the hotel restaurant. The staff there is great also and we are sure they are doing their best‚Ä¶
We tried our best to like it, and try different foods, but except the breakfast the food there is just not good. Honestly, I am sorry to say this, but the portions were either tasteless or very dry and bad‚Ä¶","Such a fantastic resort for our honeymoon! The staff were very kind and attentive and provided us with honeymoon gifts and a birthday cake for my wife. The whole resort was super clean with a fantastic view of rice terraces and fields...without all the touristy eye sores. We stayed here for 6 nights in late December in a Royal Pool Villa.
The room was very clean and spacious with fresh flower decorations and fruit provided each morning. The huge bed was decently comfortable with a soft and firm pillow. The breakfast is large and tasty...I recommend the American Breakfast with fruit yoghurt. It is a bit out of the way from Ubud center but hiring a local driver on the Grab App or renting a scooter at the hotel makes transport convenient. Will definitely be returning if we find ourselves back in Ubud. Oh and the fire flies are quite the spectacle at night.","Really an amazing resort. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The restaurant is also very good and has also a good selection of vegetarian options.
The staff was simply amazing and we loved our stay here.","Beautiful place, very romantic location and room. I will recommend it for couples.

We went with our kid and had a fantastic time, the staff made us feel special in every treatment, interaction, meals and just around the hotel. Thank you for the sweet details, like preparing the room for sleeping, including a bedtime story for the kids.

Meals in the restaurant are delicious, a very full breakfast was included (fruit, bread, and choise of main), the coffe or te in the afternoon was perfect, and dinners delicious, we decided to stay more than once instead of going out.

View to the rice fields are hard to compare, loved to wake up with the birds and watch the sunset from the pool or room."

Pools were clean, some leaves drop in throughout the day which is to be expected. Around the main pool is a valley where you cannot see any other buildings, a spot of paradise!

The area is relatively quiet, our villa was closest to the road, in the day you can hear faint engines on the road, at night you can hear lizards. Cockerels start making noise at sunrise, these are a distance from the accommodation but fairly loud, better than man made noises though!

Scooter rental is available, a little bit more expensive than other places we have stayed but it was a newish smart scooter so worth it, they have helmets you can use for free. Highly recommend a scooter as you can explore the waterfalls, rice paddies etc. A bit of confidence is needed if you want to drive it into the center as it can get busy, but I managed it fine.

There is a free service that runs several times a day to get to the center of Ubud and home, on demand service is available for an additional fee.","Had a really good time at these Villas. The main pool has a beautiful jungle view!
The villa itself was gorgeous and the bathroom was very unique.
The only issue is the location- its a bit far from the city centre but perfect if thats what you are looking for. 10/10 would stay again!","The best service is in Ubud! Our room was BEAUTIFUL, the service was amazing, the cost was great!","Best Resort in Ubud.
The junggle view is really nice and calmüçÉ

Especially from second floor balconies. If you get up early, you can see mountains. Far from center of Ubud, so here is very quite. Rooms is clean and spacious: contains comfortable bed, table with chair, bedside tables and wardrobe, conditioner and big balcony. Big windows to balcony. No problems with hot water. Wi fi had some problems, but not so often. Rooms are cleaned two times a week, swimming pool - every day. Extremely recommend this place.","Place is beautiful in the midst of the greenery. I love it, so peaceful and calm. üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü

The odd part is the bathroom and room, there are termites or I think bug that is eating the wood and is always falling from the ceiling down to the floor and it feels like there is a sand every time you walk from bed to the bathroom. Room bathroom has leakage and water is overflowing from the roof down to the floor. Please see attached videos and picture. I hope it will be fixed sooner so other guest will not experience what we experienced.

Room smells very old and humid, even if it‚Äôs cleaned properly its still smells very strong. Bed mattress smells not good, linens are not well washed and not fully dry so it smells strong. We paid about 20$ per night for 5days. Though they compensate us with a free massage which was great of them, we greatly appreciate their gesture. I still hope they fixed the room and bathroom before allowing new guests to come in.

Btw, our room is number 14.

Food is okay. My favorites are pancakes, grilled tofu, and spring rolls! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Overall, very beautiful place to stay.",We stayed here for a few days with the whole family in January 2020.  It‚Äôs just north of UBud.  It‚Äôs secluded very private with beautiful sunset views of the volcano.  The staff were fantastic.  The breakfasts were delicious with fresh fruits juice and best crepes ever.  When we get back to Bali we will definitely stay here again!,"Visited this small hotel for the 3rd time now; it's location is fantastic. All rooms have a beautiful view on the always 'singing' forest (many birds and crickets), the sound of streaming water in the small river below. Rooms are simple but good, have recently been redone; bathroom and toilet are new. Service and food are good, prices very reasonable. Everything you need for a pleasant stay is here. Enjoy your time in Ubud!","Very dissatisfied, very. We paid 14‚Ç¨/person per night. Breakfast was small and not tasteful, staff was missing from the front desk. Rooms, rooms were terrible. Smell from the toilet was awful, it was dusty, stains all over walls and blankets. Front doors were broken as were the doors on the balcony.

Moreover, my wallet went missing on the first day. I am not pointing fingers, but it just disappeared so that possibly made the whole experience worse for us and we started noticing all the negative sides of the accommodation.

Would not recommend, 2/10."

Each meal was a delight, artfully prepared and bursting with flavors that celebrate Balinese cuisine. The serene atmosphere of the restaurant, combined with the lush surroundings of Ubud, made every dining experience truly special.

The staff at Padi were the heart of our wonderful experience. Their attentiveness and support, particularly with our little baby, were exceptional. They didn‚Äôt just serve us; they accompanied us on our culinary adventure, ensuring that our needs were met with the utmost care and consideration.

In summary, Padi is more than just a restaurant‚Äîit‚Äôs a place where exquisite meals and heartfelt service blend seamlessly to create unforgettable memories.","We had an amazing culinary experience at Padi Restaurant during our 3-day stay at Puri Sebali Resort. The ala carte breakfast menu, available both at the restaurant and in-room, offered a delightful journey of flavors. The menu selection was outstanding, featuring a range of Western delicacies, Indonesian specialties, and satisfying vegetarian options. Each dish was prepared with care and presented beautifully, catering to both our palates and health-conscious preferences.

The staff at Padi Restaurant created a friendly and welcoming atmosphere, delivering exceptional service. Their attentiveness and friendliness made our dining experience truly enjoyable.

Moreover, we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, and Puri Sebali Resort went above and beyond to make it unforgettable. The restaurant staff surprised us with roses and delectable chocolate cake, accompanied by heartfelt wishes. The attention to detail and the extraordinary experiences provided exceeded our expectations, leaving a lasting impression.

We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the kitchen and service staff of Puri Sebali Resort and Padi Restaurant. Their dedication and exceptional service made our overall experience truly wonderful.",The food was very good. For breakfast there is a large selection (also vegetarian/vegan options). In the afternoon you have the possibility for a tea time. The traditional snacks were very good. From the restaurant you have a beautiful view over rice fields and palm trees. The dinner was also great. During our stay there was even live music.,"Delicious food and amazing staff! We stayed next door at Taluh Bebek, but wandered over to Puri Sebali almost every night to eat at Padi Restaurant. All the food we tried was delicious and the staff was amazing. Everyone went out of their way to make us feel welcomed and made sure our dining experience went perfectly! 10/10 would recommend!","Amazing food and service!! Highly recommended to try for dinner or lunchtime, you sitting with an amazing view in front of the rice terrace and jungle. You can bring the kids they'll take care of them like their own one!!!

The villa is luxurious,  quiet, very well prepared. It was a bless to come back to the villa after a long day of visits in Ubud and despite of being tired we always ended our day in the villa private pool. The hosts (Rene & Made) are so helpful, so kind and extremely sweet. Made has a car which made things convenient for us. Rene's luxurious homemade breakfast gave us just the best start for our day. They offer free water, tea, coffee and milk in the kitchen so we did not have to buy groceries or water everyday.
My only comment is that villa road entrance has a small ramp so if you have knee problem then be cautious. Having said that, the hosts carried our bags on arrival and departure. The rooms has AC, wifi available,  room and bathroom cleanliness is perfect. Highly recommended stay.","Best hosts in the world. They make the entire experience seamless. They make breakfast, drive you to places and share a lot about their culture.
