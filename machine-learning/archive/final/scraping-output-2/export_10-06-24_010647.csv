They have very very delicious food. My favorite is the Siomay, idk how but its soo gooood. The beverage is fine, they have non dairy milk option too. The smoothies are tasty. They are quited pricey tho.

This cafe is good if you are looking for a place to sit, working, and eating. The only problem is the AC doesnt really work when we were there, and also its a bit noisy so not recommend for online meeting.

Overall, nice cafe for hang out and do your work a bit.","It's a great place to hang out with your friends or to get some offline work done.
It's way too noisy to have work/video calls.
The coffee is good, and the food is average. The pastry is fresh and tastes best out of the food options. The space is well arranged and feels very home-like.","A comfy homey coffee shop that as someone with a toddler really loves. I can let my 2yo roam around and be happy and safe here.

The place have a really homey vibe and have games you can play while you are here. I saw also a couple people that was working here.

Their coffee are good and the food options are also plentiful and also tasty. They have reasonable prices too

This can be a favourite place to come for me and my family","It was nice, the place is cozy and warm. Such a good place to hangout with your friends. I gave three stars cos one of the staff (a girl) was kinda  harsh. It was not completely rude but kinda more like annoying. The way she‚Äôs staring at me and my friends when she delivered our order is just not a pleasant experience for us.

But the food that i eat just standard taste.
Yakimesi rice with chicken karage, the chicken is to dry and the rice dont really have a taste.

Outside dining in a beautiful and peaceful garden.","what i really like about this place is that they incorporate natural elements into their restaurant. they have fish ponds, cobblestones, vines, and plants. it feels like you step into a garden where it's green everywhere.

the food here is delicious. it's fun because you can eat different kinds of chicken dishes in small portions, so you can taste many flavors. i'm not a fan of their chicken gizzard, though. it's too chewy. but other than that, it's perfect to eat with rice and betutu sauce.

if you're a moslem, they also have a praying room albeit not too large. but that wouldn't be a problem since many places in bali don't have a praying room for moslem."

Reception agreed with that and showed us another one. In this one bathroom has not been cleaned after last guests, we found used toiletries in the shower, bed sheets were also full of stains and overall room was not cleaned properly. So we asked in reception to change sheets and clean bathroom. They agreed with that but there was no apology for that and they didn't rush to clean the room. After sheets were changed we saw that pillow sheet has holes from smoking and there still was stains on sheets but we didn't bother any more. Also our towels had stains. After night we saw that bathroom ceiling was leaking with some brownish liquid righ by the toilet. Overall disgusting hotel, sad that nobody really cares about customers.","Honestly don‚Äôt know where all the good reviews are coming from.
Worst place I ever stayed. Dirty sheets, we had to ask to replace them.
Bugs and little flies everywhere. Sink and shower head full with lime stones and didn‚Äôt seem really clean. Thank god we only stayed one night. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the pictures!","One of the receptionists is very rude and has no attitude at all. Shouting at me as the guest when I was trying to tell her in a polite way because every time I asked her, she always said ""I don't know"" without even staring at my face.

And yesterday I tried to tell her, but she cut me off while talking and told me sorry for cutting you off because you sat there on the chair in front of the receptionist while there's another guest checked in and based on the SOP you were wrong and not supposed to sit there, I could have warned you earlier (with a high tone) and I for sure replied her as she didn't respect me as a guest ""oh wow your tone was really rude and you weren't supposed to treat other guest like this etc, you're not supposed to speak in a high intonation to me as I'm the guest here"".

I've been staying here for 4 months now, but this lady named pipin doesn't seem to respect each guest who has been staying there longer.

The lady named pipin is very rude and she's not supposed to work in the hospitality industry.

I have no complaints about other staff, they are all friendly and polite except for that one lady that I mentioned above.",The room is clean but the ambience is more like a boarding house which is still acceptable.,"I usually write a long review but I will keep it short and sweet. The place is squeaky clean, staff friendly, comfortable bed, owner who wants to know how she can make the place better. All the ingredients necessary for an enduring good experience. Often I read a review and it doesn‚Äôt match my experience. I think it may be my standards but also many reviews are old and the place goes down hill.  Not here.  I will bet that this place will only get better.  I should also say the location is outstanding, quiet, clean and upscale neighborhood. Two thumbs way up."

Very clean and nice. The menu is gigantic and very complicated. There is a lack of sets which would make it easier for sharing. There is also no English menu, so use Google translate only. Staff does not speak English also.
As for food we ordered a mix of things. The tuna on nigiri wassliced so thin it was almost transparent, the salmon similar. Tamago however beautiful and thick. Gyu truffle meat was delicious! the sushi rolls.. well choice is very Indonesian focused on meats.. the California roll was drowning in mayonnaise- drowning!. Spicy tuna roll was covered in bread crumbs which dominated the taste and really took away from the rolls. Shame that the service and medium food takes away from this place. I think there is no passion and absolutely no manager to take care of the place. Also best if you cover up the staffareaon the stairs as it looks like a trash can - such a mess..
Overall i would recommend coming here keeping in mind that only bahasa service and some tastes are different from what you know from Japan or Europe.","I have to say, I enjoyed every single bite of the meal in (Okinawa Renon). I tried their new Fresh Oyster dish. Some was small some was a bit bigger and the taste is good and has great Presentation.

Considering the quality, the price is reasonable. Ideal for those who want a romantic night out. There was also plenty of room for bigger groups but make sure to book in advanced.

The manager lets us sit upstairs in the big table for big group even if there were just the 3 of us because I been here many times with my parents and ex-boyfriend from Slovakia and many other family members since they first opened so considering that, at least I felt comfortable and treated fairly because I am a long time coming back customer who lives here in Bali a very2 long time in Renon.

I recommend the Aburi Salmon Mentai üç£ yummy ü§§

So because of this nice, I will give 5 ‚ú®
üçÄLucky me!

PS: we really miss the first menu when you can pick many different mixed types of sushi and sashimi for fair price but now price had gone up for that but I used to come more often when they had that very first menu when you can pick a few sushi/sashimi and you get about 7 or 12 pieces for a super reasonable price.
