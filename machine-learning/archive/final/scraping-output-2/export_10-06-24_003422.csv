Why would I want to look at the Four Seasons when having my meal? Cocktail is really average, with very limited choice of wine. Food wise.. it's mainly Japanese, I am not sure why I would come to Bali to eat Japanese food when I can have more authentic ones at home. Comparing to many nice places in Ubud, its price is quite high. The whole place is just so dim, very comfortable to eat or drink. We came here as recommended by a friend, but were quite disappointed to be honest.",Book in advance for your stay in Ubud. This is an absolute must.. gorgeous sunset views and lovely setting in general. Great place for cocktails and food. My top 3 restaurant in Ubud for sure.,"This place has one of the best views for sunset. Add great service and amazing cocktails to it. Great time is guaranteed. Bar manager or owner offered me free negroni which was amazing. Looking forward to go back again. Don’t hesitate and visit it, you won’t regret.","An exceptional view down onto the beautiful Four Season Resort and the wonderful extensive valley and forest below this place. Perfect for sunset!
Outstanding and creative cocktail and food choices. High quality live band with an excellent singer making you feel Shade is present. Perfectly relaxing and romantic high quality atmosphere.","One of the most beautiful restaurants in Ubud area. The food was amazing, service was excellent.  The view from the terrace is of another world. I highly recommend this restaurant for both an amazing view and food."

That's what differentiates the good and the best.

Stayed at the river side villa. Amazing view from the river side villas. We spent most of our time in the resort, just drink and chill in the pool while the Ayung river flows by. What more can I ask for a relaxing holiday?

The breakfast were amazing, I am not a buffet person, so à la carte is perfect for me.","Timeless Elegance and Balinese Serenity at Four Seasons

The Four Seasons in SAYAN is more than just a luxury resort, it's a timeless experience that captures the essence of Balinese culture and hospitality. From the moment you arrive, you're transported into a world of serenity, where lush greenery and traditional architecture create a sense of harmony with nature.

The resort embodies the Four Seasons legacy of excellence. Every detail, from the warm smiles of the staff to the intricate designs of the villas, reflects a commitment to providing an unforgettable stay. The service is exceptional, with staff going above and beyond to make your every wish come true.

Speaking of the villas, they are a testament to Balinese artistry. Handcrafted wooden elements and traditional designs transport you back in time, while the spacious layout and modern amenities ensure complete comfort. Each villa offers absolute privacy, making this the perfect romantic escape.

The resort offers a wealth of activities that immerse you in Balinese culture. From sacred naps at the spa and cultural visits to Balinese farmers life. But if all you seek is relaxation, the resort is a sanctuary of peace. Lounge by the swimming pool, or simply lose yourself in the beauty of the surroundings.

What makes this resort truly special is how deeply it's connected to its location. It's one of the very best in the world, not just for its luxury, but because it embodies the spirit of Bali.","We stayed here for our Honeymoon in the summer of 2023. Four Seasons Sayan remains one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at. Staying on this property is like no other, with amazing views of the valley and stream. The tranquility of the resort was welcome after our first few days in Seminyak. While staying here we booked the private VW tour that brought us to a secluded water temple with no other tourists - a highlight of our trip to Bali. It’s certainly on the smaller side for a four seasons hotel (in terms of guest rooms) which only increased the level of hospitality the four seasons is already known for. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a luxury stay in Ubud.","During our stay at the Four Seasons Sayan, the staff went above and beyond to ensure our family's comfort, especially for our little one. From the stuff animal and sash greeting, to making sure we have milk and diapers in the villa. Their attention to detail was exceptional, particularly in catering to our baby's picky eating habits. The chefs took it upon themselves to prepare special baby food that not only met nutritional needs but also won over our baby's taste buds. Furthermore, the level of hospitality didn’t stop there; we were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary upgrade to a river side villa, enhancing our experience even more. Such gestures made our stay unforgettable, truly embodying the warmth and care that Four Seasons is known for.

The breakfast offerings at the Four Seasons Sayan were indeed delightful, featuring a variety of choices that catered to different tastes and dietary requirements. Each morning, we were greeted with freshly prepared dishes that boasted local flavors and high-quality ingredients, ensuring a delicious start to our day. However, I found myself wishing for a buffet option rather than the à la carte service. A buffet would have offered the opportunity to sample a wider array of dishes at our own pace, allowing us to better explore the rich culinary heritage of the region. Despite this, the exquisite quality and presentation of the breakfast dishes served undoubtedly highlighted the hotel's commitment to excellence in dining.

Safety was clearly a top priority at the Four Seasons Sayan, evidenced by the thoughtful installation of a fence around the pool area. This precaution was particularly appreciated given our concerns for our baby's safety around water. It allowed us to relax and enjoy the beautiful pool setting without constant worry. However, it is worth noting that the living area of our villa was exclusively outdoor. While this offered stunning views and an immersive natural experience, the lack of an indoor option meant that it could become uncomfortably hot during the day.","Bali has 2 Four Season hotels and the one at Sayan in Ubud is a resort built in the middle of dessert/jungle. When you get there, access to the resort is through a beautiful coloring wall. You can see the nature unfold before your eyes as soon as you get off the car. This is a jungle experience rather than a beach Bali experience. It’s away from the beach and city chaos and away in nature that is very relaxing."

From aromatic curries to flavorful stir-fries, every dish is a delight to the taste buds. Highly recommend for a comforting and satisfying meal.","We’ve tried some dishes, and there was dishes that i like better than the others.
We ordered 2 cocktail because of spring rolls promotions, turn out spring rolls was run out.
Tom yum prawns was good however I think something rather to sweet side to my taste, kinda missing spiciness and sourness that hit your palate.
Prawn fried rice was ok, grilled pork was tasty and crispy garlic pork was delicious","We tried eating Thai food at this restaurant yesterday. The food was pretty good, we liked some dishes better than others, price was fair.

Even though there were several other people in the restaurant, already, the food came out super quick, and did not feel like it was rushed.

If our checkout wasn’t today, we would go and eat here again.

I would recommend the ลาบ, which I think is called the spicy minced pork salad. That was the best dish they gave us.","Never failed and always good! Worth the price, 40-60k for one menu and the portion is enough for 1 person.

Kailan with crispy pork and Stir fried basil are great. Tomyum broth is really fresh, using medium size shrimp.  The curry also taste original like in Thailand.

Make sure to spare some space for fried mie / kwetiauw.
Usually all food here is already packaged with rice so make sure to double check before you order rice.

We always eat this everytime we go to Ubud. And def will alwaya go back.","The seek for the best thai food in Bali so far has come to and end, Most authentic in term of taste of the food. We came for lunch and had some dishes like tom yam goong, chicken pad thai, fried pork with garlic, mango sticky rice, everything was absolutly amazing, thai milk tea was rock, not too sweet but has a strong tea flavour. Place was quite small but feel homey and comfy, price was affordable, we’ll definitelly come back again one day.."

Both experiences were quite long and good value for money. They also supplied lunch, unfortunately the chicken was very dry but everything else was good. Prices of drinks were also very reasonable at the place. Staff were very friendly however did push a little bit for reviews. Didn’t detract from the experience but it would have been nice to review in my own time rather than being rushed.
If you do book the rafting as well, be prepared for many stairs!!","ATV - totally a new experience for my family. A good workout for shoulders and arms. The bike they are providing is in a good condition, no breakdown or break not working during the whole experience.

And the facilities from the Booking Centre, the stating point of the ATV, and the simple buffet lunch area, the shower area all are clean. The staff are friendly, especially the young guy gave us towels, showed us the buffet lunch, and the photos taken by their team member although we didn't sign up for that.

Do check out their combined package (the swing, luwak coffee plantation etc) for a good deal as we did not, and we just walked in after our lunch together with our private car  charter driver, so we paid the standard, non discount price. There is a charge of 3% extra on top of the payment if you pay by credit card.","Imagine being surrounded by lush greenery, the scent of exotic flowers in the air, and the distant calls of tropical birds echoing through the trees. Now, picture yourself navigating rugged terrain on an ATV, feeling the adrenaline surge as you conquer each twist and turn. It's like being in a real-life video game, except you're the hero. The jungle becomes your playground, with every bump and dip adding to the thrill. It's an experience that's equal parts exhilarating and awe-inspiring, leaving you with memories that will last a lifetime.","10/10!!! Had a fantastic time :)

Such a fun activity!!! One of our highlights of Ubud for sure. We arrived and almost instantly got to go on the bikes, we had a tour the whole time and lunch after - thanks for such a great day!","People are amazing, patient, friendly

Seems like there are a couple places like this, but this place you can bundle up classic car ride and rafting experiences. We took the full package. The staff at the swing was extra friendly and attentive to our needs. They requested for our phones and took professional photos for each and everyone of us. Recommend using the most recent phone for better quality. Videos and photos are all shot at professional level. Recommend hiring a dress on site to further enhance the photo experience. Welcome drink provided with a meal included packages available. For servings were decent and the taste was good. Would highly recommend everyone visiting Bali to try the experience"
