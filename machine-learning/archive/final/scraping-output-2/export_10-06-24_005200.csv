The fee to enter is 15k rp and  it is totally worth it for pathway maintenance and local cleaning. There is the main Waterfall and then a mini Waterfall to a deeper place where you can swim. There is even a changing room in this place. Amazing experience!","This waterfall is a gem ‚Äì not crowded, clean surroundings, just a very refreshing spot. What added to the charm was the boy at the entrance. His beautiful smile and kind attitude added a warm touch to the experience, making it even more memorable. Charming boy, if you are reading this: I am sending kindest greetings! :)","If you want to avoid crowd and discover waterfalls in Ubud, Bali, this is the one ‚ÄòUma Anyar Waterfall‚Äô. 10 mins walk to the waterfall from the small village and no stairs climbing. Beautiful nature around this place. One of the local boy guided us to this location. He was very friendly and helpful.","This is the third time I'm here.. And I think I can't (and won't) stop visiting this natural beauty for as long as I can stay in Bali..

The rating of this nature beauty perfectly fits for this waterfall.. You can enjoy the waterfall, and swim in the river beneath the waterfall.. For watersport (diving, swimming, snorkeling) lovers like me, this natural, beautiful, and serene place is highly recommended..

And the entrance ticket is just 15k for maintenance, which is not expensive at all for such beautiful waterfall, without waiting time here..","Very worth the visit. There is free parking in the oposite side of the road and after you pay the entrance fee of 15k you start a 3/4 minute walk down to the waterfall with a local guide. We were suuuper lucky because we got to meet Aran, he showed us everything, took dozens of pictures, and was very friendly and funny! Very worth the visit!"

The staff was very nice & helpful.
They provide very special clean drinking water for free, we very much enjoyed that.

The location was quite remote from Ubud city center - about 17 mins drive by motorcycle.
The wifi reception at the entire hotel was very bad - both in the room & the front desk area.
The water in the shower kept changing the temperature independently - from steaming hot to freezing cold, not so nice considering it was an outdoor shower.","I had a fantastic stay with Hot Stone Club. Room is basic yet comfortable. Staff are friendly and helpful. The location is good for me on this trip, a wonderful ‚Äúme time‚Äù far away from the hustle of noise. On evenings which i wish to have a sip of wine or a different menu, Ubud is 25-35 mins by Grab car, which is convenient to dial one. The yoga class each morning is definitely a pick me up. Jamu drinks were served daily and I absolutely like the scrambled tofu toast that I asked the resort for its recipe. :) thank you.","I stayed at the resort for 5 nights on my own and I loved it! My room (Apriori room) was beautiful, cosy and very clean. There is a outdoor shower, which was a nice touch! The staff was so welcoming and kind, always with the smile!
The restaurant is good, only healthy options. Choice was bit limited for me as I stayed 5 nights. There are a few restaurants in walking distance if you want to try something else.
I booked the Russian sauna the first night (extra cost), I did a couple of yoga classes (scheduled every morning at 8am) and had massages. Perfect relaxing time! Ubud centre is located 20 minutes from the resort. I used Gojek app (similar to Uber) to book a ride and go to the city. Great app!
Would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Ubud who's looking to relax!",We had a fantastic time at Banya and ice bath experience !! We highly recommend this place and service when you come to Bali!! You won‚Äôt regret it :) thank you for having us and for the wonderful experience!,"I had visited this beautiful yoga retreat a month ago and the experience was one of the best yet. The property is beautifully made and maintained. My Villa (family villa) was overlooking the rice paddy field and waking up to that view every morning was just so satisfying.

Since it's a yoga retreat the food was pure veg but surprisingly at par or even better than some meat dishes. Try the juices there, they are amazing. The staff is super friendly there specially Annie, she is so energetic and bubbly and always smiling.

Widerma, the manager (If I recollect his name correctly) has done an amazing job running this retreat.  He is also very knowledgeable and keen to help on any requests.

All in all a 5 star experience."

You need to take a taxi for half an hour to get to the centre. However, the location is a little different from the city and is ideal for a quieter stay in the villa area. The hotel also has its own transfer service.","We stayed a week at Kailash Bali and we absolutely recommend this stay! Very clean and good breakfast. Also lovely people and great service.

Thank you team üåª","Spend 3 nights at this place,
Didn‚Äôt worth the money compare to other hotels with same price, we booked one of the room facing the pool.
The room, especially the bathroom smells moldy. You will see the mold on the side wall of the bathroom.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
It wasn‚Äôt a pleasant stay.","Great experience in this homestay, although the hot shower is not fully working.
Room is super clean. Service is excellent.
Perhaps, food can be cooked faster.","Rooms are comfortable, breakfast is absolutely fantastic and the owner and the staff are the friendliest and most helpful people we have had a pleasure of staying with. They offer you rides, suggestions for trips, can do laundry, etc. The pool is also good to chill after a long day.

Highly recommended to stay here if you want a bit more of peace and quiet from Ubud city centre and traffic.

My only small problems were that one time there was no hot water in shower and that drain was draining very slowly.","Beautifully kept, well looked after and welcoming homestay experience. I definitely recommend it.

As unfortunately I injured myself (not at Kudesa) this became the perfect, tranquil environment for me to rest & recuperate for three days. The hosts / staff could not do enough for me, even ordering me food to deliver to my room when I couldn't walk!

Daily cleaning of rooms, welcome drink on arrival, decent WiFi, welcoming faces, laundry assistance, swimming pool, taxi rides and activity bookings all available; nothing was too much trouble.

Two options for food, they offer a small limited menu cooked onsite for lunch onwards or a menu from a different venue 5 minutes away that they order in for you. Cannot comment on breakfast - I never got out of bed on time! Also a few small Warungs in walking distance which you can also try.

Location wise, further away from central Ubud but this gives it its delightful peacefulness. Rooms were spacious with an outdoor bathroom.

I would not hesitate to recommend staying here."

Great place to wander around in the evenings. I have stayed in this area previously and it is the reason I returned on this trip.

Mudru has a beautiful pool and garden. And a peaceful area to have a meal. (nice simple meals)

Okay to average rooms let down the rest of the resort and have a few cons for me personally.

Not ideal privacy as anyone can see directly into your room and noise from other guests is easily transmitted through the walls and floors. The bathrooms could be cleaner and in need of maintenance.  Not horrible just requires some improvements. I would ignore the issues at a lower price point.","Awesome little resort with the nicest staff you'll ever meet. The owner was extremely helpful with any problems we had. He even helped me to send some large furniture and wood carvings I bought back to Germany.

The rooms are clean. The beds extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean bedsheeds which wad a fist in Bali for us.
The food is excellent and the pool and garden beautiful. Very good place to relax.
You will need a scooter or car to move around if you want so see things in the area. We did rent two scooters from the resort.

Highly recommendeable. We will definitely stay here again.","Quiet place in the middle of the nature. The bed is very comfy. The pool is amazing, clean and quiet big. The staff was very friendly. We requested a late check out due to our late flight and they accepted to give 2 hours extra free of charge and also let us leave the bags there for a few more hours. Had a great time here! You have two beautiful waterfalls 8 minutes walking from the hotel each, which are not so crowded and turisty like the rest but equally beautiful.","What a great property and location! I stayed at The Mudru for 15 days. The staff were always nice and accommodating, the rooms were well spaced and clean. The bed was comfortable and the view of the pool was stunning. The grounds were also well kept and tidy. The food was great and the menu had a wide variety of choices. One of the best advantages about the property, IMHO, was that it is located in a local neighbourhood, which is far from the traffic laden roads, congestion and busyness of Ubud. I‚Äôll definitely be back with my family as well.  Thank you to the owner and staff of The Mudru!","My stay at Mudru resort was exceptional. It was much beyond what I expected .

We have got this villa after couple hours wait and ignored by the first online booked villa. The first villa was full but still displayed at website.

The gardens are absolutely stunning and the the swimming pool and seating
areas are nice. Everything around closes by 8:00 PM so you'll have to buy everything you need by then. Ida, the host is quite helpful and helped us rent scooters.

Coming to the rooms. Again, rooms are big and spacious. But for a two floor room, there is a small AC ( about 0.5 - 1 tonne) which is not enough to cool the room. Lighting is dim, with only one bulb. You need to carry your international chargers or convertors. The bathrooms have glass  doors an open ceiling plan which is beautiful to look at but might be uncomfortable if you aren't used to it. No bidets or health flushes.

A men's shirt and towel went missing when they were clearly there when we unpacked. We had turned to AC on in our rooms to cool down by the time we got back but they were turned off when we came back. So someone definitely entered our rooms when we weren't there. That did throw our group off a bit.

All in all, nice pretty place. But be careful.","We spent three nights with Ida and we're extremely happy with our stay. The courtyard is beautiful, the dogs are nice and Ida is a fantastic host. He will happily help you with anything you need, be it scooters it recommendations on what to do and where to go. He is a very friendly host and we were very fortunate to have picked his hotel.
Merci beacoup et Bonne chance pour la future, Ida!","Watch out!!! T-shirts were stolen from our apartment!
Full story: We were 3 people in the room and from 2 of us one shirt each was missing after being away from the apartments. We confronted the guy working there and he didn't seem shocked. In the end he offered us each 200k for our loss. We accepted, but it had a bad taste to it and didn't feel right. We definitely still had our shirts in the apartment before and we locked the door before leaving.
If you think about it, it's a pretty good thing to steal from a guest - it's not valuable enough to call the police and also one might think its somewhere else in ones luggage or must have forgotten it somewhere else.
Would not recommend to stay there!!","Great value! Near uma anyar & sumampan waterfall. Special mention for Warung Serbet,  a small resto with DELICIOUS food..!!  200m from this lodging"

You can see the action in front of you in one of the legendary areas for wood carving in Bali.","Lovely, family-owned establishment that allows you to see the carving process as different generations go through demonstrations. The showroom is massive with items for every budget, or not. If your suitcase is full or wood carving is not your thing, it's still a good experience and, at the very least, a great photo-op.","What a fabulous place to visit and see the carving happening in front of you. Beautiful customer service, we visited on 1 August. No pressure to purchase and a stunning gallery  to shop from. (wish I had bought the bear home now)"

This is a hidden gem!!! My wife and I where heading to the Umar Anyar Waterfall and got a little hungry, thanks to the universe we were able to spot this cozy place. The food is delicious plus the pineapple juice. I also got a few passion fruits which I loved.","Awesome small family restaurant, cosy, quiet, very friendly staff and tasty food with drinks.

Flowers and lime growing outside, and you can see some interesting retro pieces, such as old sewing table, a bike and tv.","A good pick in the area, where many restaurants closed after 2 difficult pandemy years. A cosy family restaurant nicely decorated with a mix of modern / retro style. Owners are kind and welcoming. On the menu you will find a good selection of classic indonesian and western meals. Food is good, made with fresh ingredients (pictures illustrate satay lilit and cesar salad). A place worth to try!","Very well decorated place tucked down a small lane without traffic. Hipster vibes with local prices. Aircon, interesting menu and good wifi. I had the spiced fish burger and everything was cooked to perfection. So nice to have different fusion food that isn't overpriced.","Very kind owners, nice ambiente and I loved the veggie nasi goreng"
