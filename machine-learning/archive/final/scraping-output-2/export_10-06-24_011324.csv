Ari is an absolute treasure to the team, he looked after my bags for a week while I was away and was genuinely happy to help spread the Balinese hospitality.

Can't recommend enough","Just checked out and had a great time.
Super nice employees who are always there for you.
It's also great that there's a laundry next door - which I can highly recommend, by the way.
Free hot and cold water is great.
Air conditioning works great.

Couple of things to optimize:
A toilet brush
A shelf in the bathroom for storage.
A chair that can also be used to sit at a desk - the legs do not fit underneath.
A few coat hooks and hooks on the wall to hang things.

Everything else is perfect.

I will come back.

Thank you and best regards","Very comfortable place to stay.
Lovely staff and very friendly service.
Strong recommended for short stay and long stay vacation.
See you soon","Nice place, good price, lovely staff, very recommended"

That's all it has to recommend it. The room had poor lighting (one lamp didn't even have a bulb). The toilet seat wasn't attached to the toilet, there was only one thin blanket  on the bed, and when I tried to shower the water immediately smelled of rotten eggs. The staff was kind and checked me in late. The staff was excellent. But the room was seriously lacking.","We paid $32/35. We told them we were arriving in Bali at 930 pm. When we got there and  it was all dark, no messages or anything at front desk, luck there was another guess around the pool who helped us whatsapp the owner. A lady/?the owner came out, and smiled at us, she didn't talk, she walked us to our room, open door and gave us key, and left.

The room was run down. But the floor and bathroom was clean.
There was 2 enclosed private court yards the back door didn't open, stuck on paint i think, the plants was dead.
There was no water to drink, no cuttery, no glasses/cup, no kettle.
The TV and air-con worked.
No hot water.
2x towels hard towels.
2x packets of soap, and shampoo.
The bathroom tile are really slippery.
There was hair and debrey on both the sheets and the thread thin blanket
No top sheet.
The bed was solid, the mattress was hard and firm.

The pool looked clear and clean, I didn't swim so can not add more detail.
The furniture around the pool was weathered I didn't sit, so can not add more detail.
There where nice plant along the path to the rooms.

We tried to check out and no one was around,  Texted the whatsapp number, no answer. Called, received text back that they were unable to talk and asked us what we need, and than informed us to leave the key at front desk.

If the sheets and blanket didn't have hair and and stuff.
If there was a top sheet.
If there was complimentary water for drinking in a country you can't drink the tap water...
I would have given 5 stars as it reflects the price.","Wouldn't recommend. Don't be fooled by the photos. My room looked nothing like the photos and was filthy. Arrived a little early and they said they were cleaning the room. The room had 1 and a half bottles of water (one half drank by last guest). Hair on blanket, ciggerette ends outside,wifi was bad, hot water lasts all of about 3 minutes, 1 small soap bar, no coffee facilities. Spend your money elsewhere. I won't even start on their ""motorbike rental sham"". Highly disappointed for the price, much better available in the area.",Would give 0 if it was an option.,Nice

Firstly I want to say that the crew is really nice and that the problem comes from a lack of consideration from the owners.

I changed 3 times my room because I was staying long term and every time I had a problem. In Each one of the room the bathroom smelled like rotten eggs and was covered by mold, don’t be allergic. Most of the ACs won’t work. The water flow is really bad. The rooms are really dark. But the worse part is that you feel like the owner just doesn’t care. Stupid example : I ran out of toilet paper, asked for some and had to wait for 2 days to get 1. The owner told me a 7pm that they will bring some next morning, ridiculous.
Also, THERES NO INTERNET so if you need to work or watch Netflix forget it. And when I told the owner they gently told me that if I was unhappy I could just leave 🤡

So is it worth the price ? Definitely not considering there’s many other places cheaper and way better in Jimbaran !","no matter what anyone says, I want to say that the staff here is quite friendly. yes there are some problems with ventilation in the bathroom. and I would like a more efficient air conditioning system. But I want to say that the energy here is good. Also, all the minor shortcomings of this hotel are brightened up by a fairly low price.
If you are a normal person who wants to have a cheap and good time, then I recommend this hotel to you!)🙌","There was black mold on the walls, everything was covered with dust, the lights were either dull or didn't work at all.","Place wasn't clean, garbage from last guests was still in the room. Bathroom looks like hasn't been cleaned ever, even piece of soap bar of last guest was there still. Shower is warm for approximately 5 minutes, after that it needs to refill the boiler (which is hanging in the shower). There are no pillows to lay down at the pool, you will be laying on concrete. Pool also quite greenish and slippery on the inside. They're currently doing renovations on weekdays near the pool area from 9 / 5, which don't give too much extra noise but there will be workers walking around and watching you while you may be in your bikini trying to relax. 😅 One evening suddenly an alarm was going off at the front of the room I was staying in and also in all top floor units. Nobody could be found on the property, tried reaching out by phone but no one responded. After 2 hours of searching, texting and calling I went to bed anyway. Have been sleeping with earplugs in a sound like a truck driving backwards. Until finally someone turned it off in the morning around 9... At which time construction started. Pff. I would recommend to get a contact number whenever you check in to reach out to as there is no one at the property at night. Also one day woke up around 8:30 AM in whole room being covered in smoke and fire smell. The whole outside area was filled with smoke (maybe from big offers). It stuck all day since it was also humid and rainy. Left around 5 pm as I Couldn’t breath / very bad hurting throat.

Also the area is kinda sketchy, if you're a western person it's not really safe to walk around alone(even at day). People look at you and there are quite some beggars. When you have a scooter the area is fine as you will be just passing from the property to another area. You're quite central, and quite some grab food can be delivered to the property. Your scooter can be parked in the fences and underneath a roof.
There is no common toilet / shower near the pool, just the one in your room.
They allowed me to shower in another room before leaving to the airport, which was super nice. Also got a transfer by them for 50.000, it's really close to the airport around 10 minutes.

Overall it's a fine place to stay for a few days if you're mainly going out, but wouldn't stay here for longer.","Nice, quite and have a big swimming pool"

If you are staying for a long term like i did, they will change the bed linens once every fortnight or alternatively you can ask them to change it for you every 3 days (i did this). Mind you there are no safety deposit box, breakfast, water boiler nor rice cooker that are available for you to use in the vicinity. There is a shared kitchen that has a sink and a gas stove but very limited utensils. In my opinion better make sure that you are self sustained. Ie. Come home with a full belly.
