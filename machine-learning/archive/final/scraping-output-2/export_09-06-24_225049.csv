One point 11 am breakfast finish i would offer my guests breakfast whenever they want because restaurant seems all day open. So guests maybe could sleep till ……. Rest all perfekt,"Amazing place to stay! We spent here 10 days and we enjoyed every single moment here! It was a piece and quiet stay in the heart of jungles and mango trees.
The Chalet is absolutely amazing and it was decorated in European style. The furniture, bed, bed linens and bathroom are new and clean. We had everything we need in the room.
We had breakfast included and every day we got new breakfast menu: we had pancakes, scrambled eggs, toasts and sandwiches. Sometimes we had indonesian food like nasi and mie goreng. Food was really good and tasty, all ingredients were fresh and good quality. Portions were big. There was also lunch and dinner menu for extra price.
The staff is so friendly and helpful! Monica did her best to make our stay here unforgettable!
Thank you so much! We wish you luck!","After looking for a tranquil, zen and mesmerizing place to show us what the “real Bali” is like - away from the hustle and bustle tourist traps of the south, we found Ling & Louie’s place.

It was an adventure for both us and our taxi driver to find this place, but when we arrived we were not disappointed. What we found was a surreal location nestled deep in the northern part of the island. It felt free and was exactly what we were looking for. It is a high terrain, high altitude paradise.

A very steep walk up to the “summit” which definitely burnt the calf muscles and left us a bit breathless, only to find an almost spiritual like setting within Ling & Louie’s mountain retreat.

Backed onto a majestic, lush mountainous landscape. Ling & Louie’s was a perfect getaway for anyone wanting to escape reality.

Our cute little cabin had incredible views of the mountain range and sunsets and a short 10 second walk to the dining area, where our amazing hosts made us feel so special. Like we were part of their family. They showed us around their mountain, their garden and had a beautiful pool to sunbathe and even a pool table to use while watching the sunsets and having cold Bintangs.

The food was a great price, delicious and the portion sizes were perfect - something a 5 star restaurant anywhere in the world couldn’t serve up, it was that good. We ordered almost three dishes a night.

Rina and Glenn were amazing hosts and catered to our every need, they went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed and could’ve wanted. Monica, their daughter was incredibly helpful booking taxis and sharing her books. From late night talks about life, to enjoying fresh fruit and delicious lunches, we never felt like our needs were unnoticed or unmet.

If you’re looking for a walk, you can venture into the nearby villages and chill out with the locals, drink beers and go fruit picking, a truly great experience.

Would recommend to anyone who wants pure peace and tranquility. 10/10 stars for this special slice of Heaven.

Thank you and we can’t wait to return! This experience will always hold a special place in our hearts.",Very wonderful and quiet place and the food was delicious.,Perfect getaway. Fresh air. Great Matress.
