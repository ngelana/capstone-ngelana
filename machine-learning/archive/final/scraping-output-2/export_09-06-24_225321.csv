Just make sure you bring water and your picnic necessities. An umbrella also highly recommended! ü´∂üèΩ,A nice and calming place where you can enjoy a relaxing walk in the forests. A morning or evening walks is a great way to enjoy the day outdoors. Maybe it has the same feeling as an ant in a garden.,"One of the most beautiful places in Bali, I really enjoyed my time there. So foggy and mystery. Almost no people, clean and calm. 100/10.","Lovely huge garden, the total area 150 hectar. The place it's a refreshing atmosphere with fresh air everywhere.
My favorite part it's the cactus Glass house and the Giant Ficus Tree.
My suggestion if you came here for the first time and have limited time, you need to go to the 5 most favorites area by renting small car, it's only IDR 50.000 per person and if you have plenty of time, rent a bike or motorcycle with battery.
Don't even try to walk unless you are like to do  running for sport.
If you like photos ,  there's a lot of spots to take photos.  The place also good to hang around /picnic with family and friends.","Sorry if there is any reason for the system at the moment....but I want to say this because I have so much love for this place. The visitors cannot enter all areas with their vehicles except bicycles. You need to pay parking & entrance fee separately, plus pay another extra fee for various vehicles to go around, which is expensive. The system of pay-for-each is good, so that people who just sit and picnik can pay only a little.

However, please make shuttle bus reachable for anyone inside the garden and tour each spots so that we can enjoy & appreciate the beautiful garden more. if you're worried about staff costs or thefts, you can set a vending machine that sells ticket to ride the bus. This way only the driver is needed, and the guest who wants to learn more about tropical plants do not have to go back to the entrance to rent smaller vehicles (which actually cannot go around all spots). And the price to ride shuttle one time can be much cheaper, repetitive, and effective.
You can also set CCTV cameras to watch people who scatter rubbish anywhere, then ask for fine when they leave.

Please please consider because I hope to visit the garden again and teach my kid how beautiful tropical nature in Bali is. The place has so much worth."

Altho some staff are friendly, They need to improve the service, the staff supposed to ask the customer if they could clean up the table after the customer finished their order. Because it was so uncomfortable and not enjoyable since there were so many flies! You don't have to wait until a half hour to clean up those plates.","Very nice staff and beautiful place with lake view.
We came here only for sweat things for breakfast. Out of the 5 sweet dishes on the menu only one was available : fried bananas... we ended up ordering noodles and a chicken sandwich. Very simple dressing and not so good. The sandwich contained a ridiculous amount of chicken. But that's not the worse part : you get invaded by flies very quickly and when the food arrived... it was a disaster. We had like 50 flies on us all the time and we spent the 10 min trying to eat as fast as possible and slap our bodies to chase them away. So annoying. I ended walking around the table with my sandwich to run away from them... we left after 15 min. Very bad smell of paint coming from the renovation they were doing at the bottom of the garden. I think the owner should build walls around the terrace and manage his stocks better",Love the ambience...even the foods are not a lot of choice but worth it with the view...,Beautiful caf√© with hands down the best view of Beratan lake !,The view over the lake is really worth it and it's a quiet place. Mie goreng and mocktail were good but the flies are a bit annoying guests to eat with. The staff was very polite.

It was convenient and perfect for a getaway, offering a lovely view of the mountain and lake. The bed was comfortable too. I highly recommend this place for your Bedugul stay! The owner is also really nice, and they offer food services at a very reasonable price! They also provide WiFi in each cottage.

The bathroom is located outside, which is fine. But it was quite challenging as I needed to use it frequently. Especially during the middle of the night when I needed to step down and up the cottage in the cold weather.","An amazingly beautiful, quiet and cheap place to stay up on the hill overlooking the lake/caldera. Just remember that you are in the rainforest, there will be bugs in your room, just spray it and don't keep your nose in the air like a self entitled tourist and you will love it. The stairs are for fit people.","Nice Camping Cabin. üòä

Friendly owner. We arrived late at night, and he was waiting for us at the entrance. Such a nice guy. üòä

Nice comfortable bed. üëç

Reasonably priced. üëç

Delicious breakfast. üëç","Room : neatly clean and quite comfortable for sleeping, the mattress capacity is for 2 to 3 people. but there were several moments when there were ants roaming around.

Service : The guard staff is very kind and friendly. also explains all the facilities that can be used at the accommodation.

Location : very enchanting, location in the forest and very calming. Very good for those of you who need Zen."

You need to be aware that this is in the middle of the jungle so expect insects, and when I say insects I mean a lot of them. The room is full of huge holes everywhere so mosquitos, flies, fireflies, grasshoppers, moths, spiders, worms, etc etc they have a easy time coming to your bedroom. The views are amazing and during the night we had a mosquito net which helped quite a lot but honestly the amount of insects I had to deal with was unbearable. The owner was really sweet, they have a restaurant but I didn't eat so I don't know how the food is. Oh yeah, and you have to climb 80 steps to get to your room so is not suitable for everyone","Love this place! It's easy to get by scooter and the view is amazing! So peaceful ‚ù§Ô∏è

üí† The room was clean and well maintained. There is hot water in the shower and warm blankets with comfy pillows. The porch with a bench is the best place to listen to sounds of nature and just enjoy the moment.
üí† The staff is super nice and friendly.
üí† Breakfast was tasty and generous (you can choose rice/noodles, eggs option, potato/vegetables soup, juice, coffee/tea and toast with homemade strawberry jam).
üí† I didn't use wifi a lot, so cannot say anything about the Internet.
üí† The price is good and affordable.

I'll definitely come back. And it's just 5 minutes from Bali Botanical Gardens - must visit!","Great place to escape the crowd of the touristic places! Amazing view from the cabin, great breakfast on site and lovely staff! Be aware of the 80 steep steps you have to take to reach the cabins, but Angus is so kind that will help you with all your luggages. His sister will take care of your breakfast, they can rent you a motorbike and help you with the laundry service. I‚Äôd definitely would come back! Thank you","Amazing place - this was my view from bed at sunrise! And so close to the famous temple, you can go there when it opens at 7 to beat the crowds. Very close to the botanic gardens. Just make sure you don't have a huge dinner the night before -- breakfasts are quite an event!","Very quiet location with an amazing view of Lake Beratan. Many tourist attractions nearby but you need a scooter to get around. Breakfast is plentiful, there is a fridge, tea, coffee and free water refills. Strong WiFi and comfortable beds. It's in the jungle, so expect running into some animals :)
We recommend!"
