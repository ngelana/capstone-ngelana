I had an amazing time cooking Balinese food, learned a lot about their culture and their dish and can’t even start talking about the views from the place, they even have a waterfall! Thank you so much all for the experience!","Stunning location, surrounded by beautiful rice fields. Beautiful vegetable gardens and landscaping, luscious greenery and a lovely place to swim in the waterfalls and pools at the bottom. Highly recommend, worth the hike down and back up again. Purchased a mocktail to take down with us and enjoy by the waterfall. Very quiet. Can’t comment on the food - didn’t eat here","You come here for the views and they don't disappoint. We did go down to the bottom for a swim, if you are unfit like me coming back up again will be... difficult.

It was just so stunning, peaceful, lots of great photo ops. Activities for kids, my son did some painting. The play area needs close supervision and maybe isn't great for little ones, it is not built with safety in mind. But was still entertaining for my 6yo.

Food was nice, nothing special.","I think its because of the construction (they build a resort), the place isn't very well maintained when i visit. And the road to the place need a maintenance as well.
They have a good ""natural"" pool actually and you need to pass some stairs to get there. But it kinda worth to try. The ticket can be redeemed with towels/foods inside.",this is no longer the place that appears from previous descriptions. a huge 'instagram' complex is currently being built. the restaurant works but was not outstanding. the vibe is completely off.

So much fun and the food was delicious. Stunning location with a natural pool “hidden” in the jungle.","We have visited the cooking class of Rudi and are thrilled! It was not only about cooking, but we started in the garden of the farm and were allowed to harvest the ingredients ourselves. Rudi explained all the plants to us and even told us what else you can use them for. After that it was time to cook. Rudi explained everything very well and it was a lot of fun. We prepared a wonderful, delicious meal with his help. The team even prepared a table just for us in rose petals with the view of the waterfall. There we could enjoy our meal. It was a wonderful experience. We will recommend the cooking class to anyone who comes to Bali!","The cooking class at Sanggraloka farms was amazing- you truly get a taste of the farm to table experience. Chef Rudi guided us through the farm and helped us harvest ingredients for our authentic Balinese dishes. After harvesting our ingredients, we prepared them to cook ourselves. Chef rudi walked us through each step and made it fun and enjoyable! Lastly we were able to plate our food and enjoy all our hard work for lunch! Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Bali!","It was an amazing experience! If you want to do a cooking glass with fresh ingredients, lovely people and a amazing view you are right here!
It was so funny and we learnt a lot.
The place were you cook and eat is amazing and also perfect for taking nice pictures!",picking food ingredients from organic farming to table cooking and learning about traditional balinese cuisine you can get here and I recommend all my experiences to everyone a great experience
