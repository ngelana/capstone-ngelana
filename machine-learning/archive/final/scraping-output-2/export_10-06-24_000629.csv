I spent 3 nights here and felt like that was a good amount of time. The food each meal was fresh and delicious, the rooms were clean and the private bathroom had a hot shower and toilet. The jungle is loud at night and you can here other guests making noise but I found ear buds blocked that out completely. The staff were so kind, in particular, Made who works in reception - she made me feel so welcome with her warm nature. The scenery looking out onto the rice paddy fields is stunning and so calming. Massages are available by appointment. I recommend booking in with Bu Wulan if you can get a spot because she was AMAZING.","Wow, the level of thoughtfulness, care & love poured into this space amazed me! I had such a special experience. It felt like there were invitations to slowly explore and interact with throughout the retreat. I especially loved the labyrinth and the fire at night. It’s the perfect balance of silence/ space and activities you can choose to do.

The food is incredible!! Everything was delicious and it’s all grown on site. So flavourful and very healthy.

The staff were warm and attentive while giving space to my process.

I chose the basic single room. One wall was open to the jungle. After the first night I slept with the blind open and absolutely loved falling asleep and waking up to soothing jungle views.

The beds are also comfy and the sheets felt luxurious.

Gorgeous nature & views around all the grounds too!! Very very special.

It is a big blessing to be able to go to Bali Silent Retreat. I highly recommend it!","The best was to escape from stress and noice, even one day will be enough to recover fast ,better to arrive alone , during the day you will have a plant things to do , they have buffet for breakfast , lunch , dinner. 2 yoga, meditation classes, library with a big selection of books , you can also bring the book and present to them, walking in the jungles , meditation labyrinth , massage ( book 1 day in advance ) on arrival left you phone in the box and keep silent","Trying to provide an objective view of my experience here. Overall it was a good experience, but there were a few things I hope could’ve been better.

What I really liked about my retreat:
1. The retreat center itself is really peaceful and far away from the urban areas
2. Compared to a lot of yoga/meditation retreats the program is very simple, two sessions per day including stretching and meditations, no other additional trips or fancy rituals, which is basically what I’m looking for
3. Food! I’ve never been a fan of vegan food but the food here really changed my mind
4. Most people are pretty respectful to the rule. I’ve only encountered one person using his phone in the lounge (no phone area) and a couple of girls giggling once.

Things I didn’t like or feel could’ve been better:
1. The transportation communication. When I made the booking it asked me if I needed a pickup, but didn’t state other details, so I assumed it’s included in the booking. Per inquiry I was also only told to WA the coordinator the day before. Then the night before when I WAed the pickup, they told me the transportation fee of 550K. It was a bit pricey knowing the local transportation fare but I figured it would be more convenient. Then the morning when I was there I learned I needed cash to pay. So we went to a few ATM centers and somehow my card didn’t work on non-BCA ATMs then I requested a bank transfer. It’s all very trivia hiccups but honestly could’ve been mentioned in the booking or confirmation email or maybe just a friendly reminder the day before;
2. So I came directly from the airport to the retreat and the drive was about 2.5 hours. So in total I was traveling for more than half day non-stop to get there before the office closes. Upon arrival we went directly into payment collection, intro video then walk tour. Honestly a welcome tea or water or any snack would be really appreciated after that long trip. My flight wasn’t even that long so I can’t imagine how tired other people would be coming from a longer trip.
3. The room - probably the biggest disappointment for my trip. I booked the single room given the fare is definitely standard for a decent one-person stay in Bali. However there is no door or any divider between the open balcony and sleep area, and it felt like I was camping every night especially in loud pouring nights. The bed is really small for me (I’m only 5’5). The worst would be there’s only a concrete half wall dividing rooms, so technically each room is a cubic in a shared space, meaning there is no real privacy when you use the bathrooms which feels REALLY WEIRD. The lighting is pretty bad, and whenever my neighbor room turned on their light mine went really dimmed. All of these really make the room feels overcharging and I hoped they had more details of the rooms on the website.

Oh another thing - reading some earlier comments and program details online, it seems like they did have yoga sessions previously and some instrument thing in the evening, but now the daily movements do not include yoga but stretching sessions instead, with some similar yoga movements.

So yea I still made the most use of my silent experience to reflect and read which really helped me to reset my mind. It’s a cool program so hope they can fix the small details to improve the overall experience.","Stayed here for 2 nights 3 day and could have stayed longer to go deeper inwards and get more clarity.

Unlike, Vipassana, BSR is a lot more relaxed and freflow. You can read, write and choose to do whatever you want in the day from meditations, movement to taking a nap in a hammock.

The location is amazing, surrounded by ricefields and very lush and everything in BSR is very well thought out. They have cute signs everywhere, grow their own food, incorporate locals and their traditions, have an expansive library etc..

The staff is also very sweet and professional and you can tell they love what they do.

Now a bit on the room for improvement.
1. Because it is more relaxed, I saw a lot of people with computers and their phones outside the cowork. They have a place call the cowork by the reception but this place kind of defeats the purpose of being there. I saw people there smoking, and having calls..
2. You pay a daily rate for the room and another for food and activities. In my opinion the food fee is very high for what you get. Everyone raves about the food and it was good but I personally only found the dinner really good. Breakfast was very basic and lunch was a very bland green salad and raw veggies with dips.
3. If you don't like bugs and nature, this is not the place with you. There is no AC, it rains a lot (in rainy season) and you will hear mosquitoes at night and you will see other bugs around.
4. Last, the rooms... I stayed in the private single top floor and they aren't lying about, if you are a light sleeper don't stay here... you literally hear everything, specially bathroom noises and snoring..."
