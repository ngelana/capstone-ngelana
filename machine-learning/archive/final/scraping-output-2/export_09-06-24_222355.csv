The staff (the family) make you feel like you are their family, they helped us fit in dolphin tour, waterfalls and plankton all in one day, it felt like a bucket list day for us and we had the best time. Lucky and his family including the kiddies and Bruno the dog will stay in our hearts forever ","The place is just perfect to enjoy time in lovina, the people here are the kindest i've meet, I just can recommand you this hostel ! I try the hamac, the tent and the dorms, the three it's good and the prince is really cheap ! You can alors booked with them for the plankton, the dolphin, dive or snorkeling, this is all perfect, the food also is really delicious ! Thanks a lot ðŸ©¶",dont trust the ratings. they offer cheap beer for 5 star ratings. the air con does not work. place below average. ugly rooms and toilet,Family hostel was such a joy!! The owners are so genuine and caring and really want to make you feel part of the family. I really enjoyed the dolphin tour I did with them and of course singing karaoke all night. Highly recommend for your stay in Lovina. I will be back for more Shakira songs!!,"You feel like you are part of the family. Everyone here was super nice. The breakfast was delicious. The dorm room was clean and comfortable. Itâ€˜s nice that you can just walk past the kitchen and the rooms of the family to go upstairs to the bathroom. This makes it feel very authentic and like you are part of the family.
You can book activities directly with the owner.
Also the location is very local. The streets were very quiet and also a lot of nature around. I would recommend renting a scooter and just driving through the little streets around this place.
If I had more time I wouldâ€˜ve stayed a few nights longer."
