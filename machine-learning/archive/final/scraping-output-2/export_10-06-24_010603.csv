Always give it a go instead of dine in.,"A bargain! For 25k small duck and rice, it is a well worth dish! Tasty sambals and seasoning, well fried duck, and fairly quick serving. You might want to be patience at queueing and parking is hard to find.","Still don't understand the hype. Yes, the sambal is tasty and the black seasoning is great. But that's it. The duck meat is a bit tough and chewy.","It was good and fun until the so called food reviewer come and this peace fried duck stall become so crowdy. Kinda sad. We used to eat this scrumptious duck since they open on little bengkel terrace. But now, it takes much effort üíî"

Renowned for its exceptional taste, generous portions, and reasonable prices, it's no wonder it's a favorite dining spot. Every bite of their babi guling is a culinary delight, showcasing the perfect balance of flavors and textures. What sets this place apart is its thoughtful offering of frozen babi guling, allowing travelers to bring a taste of Bali back home with them. For an authentic and satisfying babi guling experience that won't break the bank, Warung Babi Guling Swari is the ultimate destination.","A hidden gem located on the narrow street of denpasar, this place serve excellent babi guling. Road to this place can be a little difficult, especially if you go to this place with car. Parking also a little bit difficult, the street is narrow and they doesn't have a parking spot.

The place itself have a very traditional balinese home. Serving time is quick, even though a lot of food delivery courrier queing. Pork is tender and juicy, the sambal is excellent too. The pork is fragrant, combined with their sambal, it is very delicious. The soup is very delicious too, fragrant and a little bit spicy. This place is better than most of the babi guling restaurant in the touristy place such as kuta and jimbaran. And they have lower price too.","Taste awesome, a different variety of babi guling because they put some unusual ingredients. Especially i like their sop balung. Worth to try!",This is a hidden gem! Taste really good and very cheap. This place needs more exposure. Definitely I would love to go back here!,"Overall delicious. Idk if it's just their style but the skin is not crispy. It's not rubbery either. Just melts in your mouth. Still pretty good, but expected it to be crispy. Love the spice"

I highly recommend this place for anyone who likes pork satay.","Great pork satay and open till night, their sate babi bumbu dalam was the best, and pairs it sambal, it will make a match in heaven. It usually have a lot of queue especially from online order, so do expect some online drivers when dining in. Overall very recommended satay!","I recently tried sate sabo for the first time and it was absolutely delicious! Sate babi bumbu sabo from Sate Sabo is definitely my go-to meal, plus, it's always served fresh.

The price was incredibly reasonable, considering the quality of the food.","Recommanded, the place very clean. Gread taste for Sate Plecing, Sate Sabo, Sate bumbu Dalam and babi kecap. We will back and try another menu. Mantap!!","Tried this vintage pork satay restaurant for the first time. Their location was at a busy road. Ordered their Sate Babi Bumbu Dalam, Sate Babi Bumbu Sabo & Soto Babi. My favorite was Sate Babi Bumbu Dalam because the flavor was perfectly marinated into the meat.

So far the sambal taste was so nicely balance with sweet, sour, spicy ""u named it"". All the fruits selections are also a lot and they are giving very generous on the portion. Love this place, but when busy time u might be patient waiting in line. Thanks for having us. We'll always be back. üòä","Rujak dan tipatnya juara! For those seeking for authentic balinese fruit salad and peanut sauce-salad, this is the place. Affordable, quick serving, but limited parking area.","I've been buying rujak here since I was in high school until now. The rujak is authentically delicious because it's still prepared traditionally.

The downside is that it can get really crowded since the place is small, so it feels very hot and stuffy. There's not enough space, and sometimes there are dirty dishes still on the tables. The parking is only available for motorcycles, so don't bring a car because there's no parking here.

It's better to get the food to go and eat at home if you don't want to eat in a hot and cramped place. If you want to dine in, it's better in the late afternoon from 5 pm until closing because it's not as crowded then.","The great place to take authentic Balinesse meal

Tipat cantok and rujak kuah pindang is the best
Try es gula pasir and es tape also","Very nice food, but no air conditioner and fan."

I checked several times before visiting because I wanted to know information about the menu and confirm reviews from previous visitors about this meatball stall.
When I entered the shop, also wasn't busy around all, only one table with 3 persons were already eating, I stepped in and was very excited and happy that I finally had the chance to stop by. I looked around the wall containing menu writing and chose Beef Vein Meatballs. I asked, what does the menu contain, ma'am?

Surprisingly, it seemed like the seller didn't want to bother explaining and seemed reluctant to explain, with the response with one level rising voice, she answered ""It's all the same, you get all the items."" My hope by asking was, I intend to add items if I think it's small portion and also I am used to trying the dishes that are sold for my very first time visit. As a meatball lover, this is mandatory for me.

Since i told her frankly that ""Tell me coz this is my first time, please."", she's cooling a bit down. And this all scene such a letdown just before i got to eat the food. üòÇ

And not to mention when she brought the bakso that I ordered, i found out she only gave me fork without spoon üòÇ im laughing to myself. Oh my...

Anyway back to the food review;

Bakso Urat Sapi / 15K -- 7/10
Es Teh -- 7/10
Bakso Goreng 2pcs (additional) -- 6/10

Overall, alternative to get Bakso Malang if youre around the area.","The server smiled all the time, which was nice. Good service! The food is ok!","I tried beef meatball
The meatball itself is wonderful, broth is great
But the disappointment lays in the chilli ü•µ dont like it at all
As meatball lover, this is such a letdown",I love the Baso Sapi komplit with sambal and krupuk. Drink jeruk hangat also make the dinner completed. Don't forget to come before night so u can get lontong/ tipat also to give your stomach fullness,This is my fourth visit the food is excellent the price is good the atmosphere is good the service is excellent. Location is clean and tidy inside and out thoroughly recommended
