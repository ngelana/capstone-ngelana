Nestled in the scenic beauty of Luwus, this restaurant offers an authentic taste of Balinese cuisine, with their Babi Guling being the star of the show.

The Babi Guling (suckling pig) was exceptionally prepared - crispy skin on the outside, tender and flavorful meat on the inside. Each bite was a burst of traditional spices and flavors, perfectly encapsulating the essence of Balinese cooking.

What added to the charm of Depot Betty was the warm and welcoming atmosphere. The staff were attentive and friendly, making us feel right at home. Their recommendations for side dishes and drinks were spot on, enhancing our dining experience.

Moreover, the value for money here is incredible. Delicious, high-quality food at reasonable prices is a rare find.

If you're a food enthusiast exploring Bali, Babi Guling Depot Betty is a must-visit. It's more than just a meal; it's a culinary journey into the heart of Balinese culture. Highly recommended for an authentic and memorable dining experience!","First time try this Babi Guling here at Bedugul, usually will have it at Ubud. The taste is good, just notice there is pork fur still on skin which I can’t really take it. Overall with the price and portion, my tummy is happy.

Worth to try: 4 stars","1 of the best Babi Guling here in Bali. I'm not sure is this famous restaurant but i have been to others' so-called 'famous' restaurants but i find this restaurant babi guling is better.

I recommend this restaurant if you pass by.","Above average Balinese Pork restaurant, very recommended if you're Babi Guling Lovers. The place is a big plus because it's clean and comfy, makes you enjoy your foods even more. There are plenty of parking spaces especially for cars but its across the street. It was a bit crowded when last time i visited but i got my order served in less than 10 mins, pretty fast I'd say, so a plus for services too.","They have same menu with different portion. Not only taste, they also give good atmosphere and enough parking space. I think this branch is better than others. And I got crispy pork skin, it’s a good taste for it."
