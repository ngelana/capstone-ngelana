Amazing experience to do flying fox across the rice fields.
Well trained staff, the owner is very kind and humble.",Panda boat park with several trails for adults and kids. There are several winter linas over the rice fields. Very friendly hosts!,"Our best local experience in Bali from far! The owner of this domain and his lovely wife are so friendly and welcoming. We spent all the evening with them to learn more about their balinese culture. They learnt us how to cook Lak Lak, the speciality dessert from Bali, and how to make the local tea, and how to make an offering in their tradition. They also shew us how to play with their instruments, especially the gamelan. We spoke for hours and it was so interesting and enriching. We can see that they love what they do, and they don’t ask anything in exchange, so please don’t hesitate to make a donation to help them.
There are also trees games for kids, or even for adults of course.
Thanks again a lot, om shanti shanti shanti om, matur suksma.","Had a great experience here. Gede, the owner, is really helpful and the adventure was challenging enough. But he also has different levels!",Amazing zipline above the rice paddies. The staff is professional and welcoming. I recommend to anyone visiting to try it out !

They have an array of different teas and coffees which you can try for free, yes you heard that right. They bring you a tray of 12 samples to try which you can decide to buy in their shop. The Luwak coffee you have to pay for to try. They also have a swing on premises  (one single and one for a couple to sit on at a cost) which over looked beautiful views.","Rp 300,000 for couple Swing and Nest. Free coffee and tea tasting. Rp 50,000 to try giant cup of Luwak Coffee.

Tour - Educational and fun, guide was great and friendly. Really cool to see a whole pineapple plant and durian tree!

Swing and Nest - Swing is very scary but very fun, highly recommend, views are incredible. Nest doesn't move, so not scary to do. Worth trying!

Coffee and tea tasting - Very fun to try so many! We ended up buying the Pandan Tea since it was so good. They have different sizes in the gift shop.

My only complaint is the poor musang/luwak needs to be freed or at least given a bigger habitat.",Lovely place to have coffee or tea with a view and the opportunity to swing. They explain the plants in their garden and there is a Luwak.,Nice view,Nice swing...!!!
