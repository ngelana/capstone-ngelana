I lived in an ordinary villa with a shared infinity pool from which you have a beautiful view of the valley! The room is small but very cozy and clean, there is everything you need. Beautiful area and very friendly staff, great service. I had a wonderful time alone with myself and nature! I will definitely be back!","What a stunning place, incredible staff and service. The highlight is the floating pool overlooking plantation terraces.On a clear day you get a gorgeous view of the mountain. Lots of attractions close by, botanical gardens, luwak coffee tasting, waterfalls, temples, lakes...Food is delicious and bedding super comfortable.Totally worth a stay!",We are two families of 4 adults and 3 kids stayed in Villa no 06 for 1 nights.
