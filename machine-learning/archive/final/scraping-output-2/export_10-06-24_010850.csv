Wonderfully quiet place. Driving a scooter is recommended because of the location, but you can get around with a taxi or guide as well. It has great facilities. The swimming pool is large and a nice place to connect. The dorms have AC and nice beds with a large storage drawer, curtain, lamp, and socket. The atmosphere is social but calm at the same time, so there's something for everyone. The staff is amazing! They are helpful, vibrant, and nice to hang out with. Also, the food is amazing! Western food with quite a few vegetarian and vegan options. They also have two cute dogs who love to get some cuddles.

I initially booked for two nights, but I ended up staying for seven nights! I was sad to leave this hostel because it felt like home to me.","The hostel itself is great. Staff are lovely, comfy beds, a great pool and it’s fairly social but also not party. They do some great food too and you can set up a tab which makes life a lot easier.
The issue for me was location. If you don’t know how to drive a scooter it becomes very difficult and expensive to get to the places you want to go. Furthermore, if you want to go to some of the bars in the city later on at night it becomes impossible to get home. There is nothing within a 10 minute walk of the hostel so you generally have to get a scooter or taxi. The roads are not very forgiving for inexperienced drivers either.","It was so good the first time that I came back.
Clean rooms, great vibe, friendly people and awesome service. Workers go above and beyond to make everyone feel included and make sure everyone is having a good time.
Private area, great music and the pool is cold. Would recommend. The food is awesome!!!",Best hostel with the best staff! The place is just amazing and beds were really comfy :) Special thanks to the staff who helped me out when I had logistic problem (I was a girl travelling solo and they literally saved me). I couldn't recommend it more! Also the place is even better than what we can see online and the food was really good,The best hostel I’ve stayed at in Indonesia. Great service and food. Amazing common areas and the dorms are super comfortable. Was supposed to stay for 3 nights but extended my stay on two separate occasions.

However, note that you will need a taxi to go out for dinner (if you want to go to the nice cafe/restaurants on the beach side), which will cost you ~200K IDR to go and come back (even if 10min drive).
However, the rooms are nice and clean, very comfortable.
The breakfast is ok with a choice between eggs or banana pancakes and a tea or coffee.","Bed was comfy. Aircon was good. TV wasn't smart TV. Location has a good view of Bali but you need a scooter to get around as it is up a very long hill.

Pool is great and good temperature. Food was nice and you can pay with credit card 3% fee though.

150k taxi from the port. Breakfast was simple menu, eggs or pancake.","Overall a great stay for the budget in Penida. The staffs are just awesome. Kudos to their way of handling guests. We booked all activities through them since price and arrangements were great.

Just a small suggestion is to improve the bathroom maintenance. Otherwise everything else was just perfect.","For the price, great place to stay. Refreshing welcome drink, nice breakfast. Clean room and bathroom, welcoming staff. Nice pool. Location is nice, quiet and only 15 minutes away from the harbours.","The location is excellent- up on the hill so very peaceful and just a short journey downhill to the beach. Good location for exploring both east and west. The room is fantastic - very clean and refreshed everyday plus the bathroom is big and clean. Everything is exactly like the pictures. Free toiletries and tea/coffee are included and refreshed everyday. The service from the staff is excellent - every evening we came home to our lights on, AC on low so the room is cool and bed turned down - extremely welcoming and comfy! Everything we asked for they did with a smile and nice chat. We did laundry, rented a scooter and booked taxi and ferry tickets all really easy! There is a little restaurant on site too the breakfast options are great and can be tailored to our needs and the meals are tasty and priced well! Staying at Sarivanna feels like staying at a fancy hotel the service is so great! Big thanks to the team at Sarivanna Penida!!"

It’s located about 10 minutes drive from the North of the Island, where most restaurants are, and perfectly positioned to access both the East and the South coasts of the island. It’s about 15 minutes from Toya Pakeh Harbour.

The family running these cottages is wonderful, extremely friendly and generous. We’ve seen one of the family member make the furniture for the bathrooms and therefore had even more appreciation for the place they built and all the homemade furniture.

Their breakfast is great, and having it on the terrace with such a view sets your day!

The room has a fridge and a kettle which is a great bonus!

If you like nature, are looking for some disconnection, and want a beautiful stay, book at Aryaginata!","Best thing that could have happened to me during my stay on Nusa Penida. Beautiful, well kept Bungalows in the most idyl location. I stayed for a full 3 months and enjoyed every single day, beginning with the scenic (and tasty) breakfast from my porch, overlooking the jungle, the ocean and Mount Agung, a warm shower in the open bathroom and only a 5 to 10  minute ride, down to the best cafes of the island. The hosts were very friendly  too and gave their best to help me with all of my needs - they even helped me drive my suitcase up to a friends place, after my stay ended. Definitely going to come back one day, sooner or later.
Makasih banyak :)","Super great bungalow. This is the nicest accommodation I have ever used on my travels. Wonderful staff, amazing views, romantic and peaceful location. Walking distance to town about 3 km along a footpath along banana, fig and palm trees. Breakfast very good. WiFi works here, air conditioning is efficient enough. Refrigerator functional.","Amazing family run cottages. Very accomodating, delicious breakfast, beautiful surrounding.

Highly recommend!","Tranquil. Honestly one of the best places I have stayed at over the last 4 months of travelling SE Asia. Comfortable beds, cute little semi-outdoor bathroom. Beautiful landscape. The only downside is the water was cold and it was very far from anything so had to rely on the staff to book our taxis (who unsurprisingly charged more)."

Nice awakening in the early morning. Beautiful view to the sea and the mainland Bali. The big volcano is impressive.

Good service and nice staff. The owner speak very well English and has hospitality as a high priority.

The room was clean and well maintained.

I wanna coma back.","I stayed here for 4 nights and I was extremely impressed. The location is quiet and relaxing with an amazing view, yet still close to busy spots and must see sights.
The food available at the resto is quality and tasty! Rooms and common areas are clean and beautiful.
The staff at Teba garden are incredible. Catering to your every need and more!
They helped us to book a snorkeling trip at a great price, gave us advise on local destinations and brought us local fruit to enjoy.
The staff even went so far as to come to work early to cook us breakfast as we were leaving before the normal breakfast time.
I highly recommend this spot and would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Thank you Teba Garden!","Stayed here for one night but wishing it was longer. The room is nice, bed is nice, the shower is super nice. Love the view. When you open the door of your room you can see the magnificent Mount Agung. The staff is very friendly and hospitable. Had a slight mishap from a certain website, totally not the hotel's fault, but they handled it nicely. Made us feel very welcome.
Just a liiiitle problem, the door is a little bit hard to open. But otherwise, everything is nice.","The location:
The hotel is located in the jungle at the hill top. Easy access with paved road about 6km from the harbor (15 mints scooter ride) with a good bargaining skill you can get a Taxi to drop you off for 50k.

The room:
This hotel is recently established (about year ago). The rooms are cottage style, with a lot of privacy and great view. Every thing inside is new and sparkling clean! However, there are no mini-bar (mini fridge) and safe-box in the room. Small pool but clean. Poor internet connection and depending on your cell career you might have weak signal.

BEWARE!
Got my watch stolen by the staff. However, with a bit of drama I was able to get it back!","One of the best places to be for nusa penida enthusiast. Great staff. Services superb.

The owner is friendly and his nephew Wayang (19 tahun), thank you for your warm welcome and advice!

The room is big, clean and comfortable. The TV let you learn bahasa Indonesia quickly, only 3 channels on my room.
The location is very central to Al directions.
Because is a little away from the busy Beach area. I love it. Quite at all times. Swimming pool makes it perfectly.

And BACK AGAIN AFTER 3 YEARS. it's still my favorite place to stay!

Service and kindness still very good.
One of the former manager, Suwindra, thanks a lot!"
