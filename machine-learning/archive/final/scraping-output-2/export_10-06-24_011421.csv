The hosts are kind and will make everything they can to make your stay memorable. The rooms are very clean. But yea you can expect some geckos in the room but that‚Äôs part of the experience :) yes the accommodation is a bit remote from The rest of the village and you will have to walk 25min for the beaches and scenic spots (20min by scooter as you have to take a detour), but if like us, you‚Äôre looking for a quiet place, with really nice people, Mahendra is definitely what you want üòä","Few things you have to know before book this place

It looks close to the beach but it‚Äôs not.
‚ñ™Ô∏è16 minutes on a bumpy road one way to get to the main road
‚ñ™Ô∏è24 minutes to get to the Diamond beach
‚ñ™Ô∏èdark at night
‚ñ™Ô∏èif you are not experienced driver better don‚Äôt go there

Otherwise
‚ñ™Ô∏èhot water
‚ñ™Ô∏èfresh big towels
‚ñ™Ô∏èokay wifi
‚ñ™Ô∏èbreakfast is included
‚ñ™Ô∏èac in the room
‚ñ™Ô∏ènice view from the room on ocean, islands and jungle
‚ñ™Ô∏èbeautiful and peaceful place

For me it was a surprise road conditions and the price/far from beach

We stayed for 1 night and it was a bit weird choice
It was 400k/per night","Super spot, quiet, calm and wonderful hosts. Not far from the beaches, Atuh & Diamond, and the road in is not as bad as it sounds. We rode in on scooters with all our backpacks and luggage and managed fine!",We stayed for two nights. The service and the food was excellent. We enjoyed the room as well. Really beautiful cottages. We enjoyed also to walk to diamond beach by foot. It is quite and lovely.,"Mahendra Cottage is located in a small village and run by a lovely local family. They were really attentive and helpful during our 10 day visit. Everything is extremely clean, and they provide shower gel, shampoo, fresh towels, and cleaning throughout your entire stay. Drinking water is not included, you have to pay 15k/1.5l. Local people burn a lot of plastic nearby, it smells bad if you're sensitive to it. Expect geckos in your room sometimes.

The location is a bit far from everything (Diamond beach is 25 minute walk). They offer scooter rental, but you should be extremely careful: don't go out after sunset, the lamp of the scooter is not bright enough to see the potholes in the dark.

Most restaurants close early during low season (november to mid-december for sure), so your only option for dinner is Mahendra Cottage kitchen or AB restaurant. During lunch, the situation is better, but you won't have any gourmet experiences here. Watch out for bali belly.

We really enjoyed our stay here. I hope they can make their dream come true and build a pool later :)"

Basic help to reach you out for water supply, towel and Kettle which is mentioned , nothing over and beyond we‚Äôre asking. The place is nice but you cannot go on comparing with money from the start when we checked -in. To find you around we went in kitchen and other rooms to search you as we didn‚Äôt receive any response from long on multiple calls and msgs. We are completely fine if the housekeeping was not done as you‚Äôre not well, we cooperate with you. Also, appreciate to guide us for the route towards diamond beach :)
We can surely recommend to people visiting if we get basic facility. Hope you take it positively!","There is only one room with good views and a window. Others don't have a single window. The place is very isolated. There are not a lot of places nearby. The road to this place was also not in a great condition.

It is close to the diamond beach though. You can opt for it if you have multiple days in nusa. You can stay here one day to enjoy diamond beach and other days you can stay at some other place.","Very nice experience, the lady is very helpful and kind, we are so glad we found this hotel, I love the ambience, the room is clean, the wifi is fast, the small road in front is so quiet, and it's cheap.
Ibu is very polite, she helped us with stuff and she gave us free noodle before checkout , definitely will come back here . Thankyou ibu .","I was here for 8 days and I love this place and Ni Ketut family. You can feel and see that they also love what they did and doing here, they are really kind and helpful.

A little heaven in the middle of nature and coconut trees, full of details and far from the party party locals so it's perfect to rest your mind and body.
The rooms are big and very comfortable, aircon work really good, hot water available also and the wifi are really good. The best bed I tried in two months in Indonesia!

Ni Ketut are a good chef, I love all what she cooked for us!

I don't need a 5 star hotel when I can go here!","Is the perfekt place to enjoy the quite of the Hill, do some trekking (25 Minute to Atuh Beach and Diamond Beach trou a secret pat that the owner will Show you) and enjoy the beuty of the beach without driving 2 HOURS (1hour to get there and 1hour to get back). No traffic, no Stress, no pollution...and THE PRICE IS TOP comparig to the oder Guesthaus in the neighborhood.
It is a Family Business, they are really frendly, the all area is really tide and the rooms are PERFEKT!!!
The food is really good and made with love.
You will love this place ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks again to the Owners"
