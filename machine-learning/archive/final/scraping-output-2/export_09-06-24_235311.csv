ChIJg1sLy5Yo0i0RXOqsjpwQRlk,Sarinbuana Eco Lodge,-8.3930214,115.0786335,"Jalan Arjuna, Br. Biyahan Desa Wanagiri, Dalang, Kec. Selemadeg Tim., Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82152, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=6432847382339971676,OPERATIONAL,+62 813-3902-8839,,lodging,4.6,219,,"Beautiful place, such an inspiring and truly nourishing place to be. To soak in the natural world, and man's place in harmony with it, is priceless. Will definitely return. That being said, the rooms were OK for the price, not the cleanest but not dirty either-- you're living in the jungle, and you're paying for the holistic experience of being able to walk around the beautiful gardens, pools, ponds, waterfalls. Don't expect a resort. And it's expensive, for Bali. Also, they cook with Canola Oil FYI. I loved the taste of the beautiful fresh food and was disappointed to find out on the last day that they cook with toxic industrial oils. Luckily it was all cooked with love and yummy fresh ingredients, hopefully they switch over to something that is healthy, such as tallow or lard.","Wow, truly an inspirational family run eco lodge. It was so joyful to see the Balinese community cared for and respected  so highly. Take some time to read the guide book, the history and background of The Sarinbuna is a beautiful one. Putri and her team make you feel like one of the family, while Made and her team in the kitchen serve you the most amazing meals fresh from the garden and local farms, honestly I think the food is some of the best we have ever eaten. We ate every dessert and recommend everything! Be sure to have the special each day to get a real guide to traditional Balinese food :) There are too many amazing things to tell but you will just have to visit. Lastly I must mention the wonderful Sauna, that was an epic experience! We will never forget our time here and take inspiration to live this way in the future. Peace and love üôè",Absolutely loved it. The food was out of this world (especially anything with their chocolate). The activity options are fantastic and all run by local residents. Location and setting are beautiful and quiet. Not rugged whatsoever but be conscious that they are trying to sustain a natural and chemical free ecosystem (so bugs are encouraged etc).,"We had the most enchanting stays (2 already) at Sarinbuana Eco Lodge and we simply cannot wait to be back and back and back again!
Everything about this lodge is beautiful : the surrounding nature, the amazing natural pool, the perfect service, the unexpected sauna, the private waterfall, the ravishing permaculture garden, the overall comforting and relaxing atmosphere to name only a few of the things this place provides to nature lovers and peace seekers.
Thank you for so much care & beauty üåø","Owner opened my car door when I was in the car park trying to help my sick 11 month old baby sleep. Used an arrogant tone. Started asking me question. She didn‚Äôt ask me if I was ok just asked me questions like ‚Äúwhy are you sitting here? Did you mean to leave your car on? Are you coming to eat in my restaurant!?‚Äù I had never met this woman before and she opened MY car. Didn‚Äôt ask. Didn‚Äôt tap on the window first . No ‚Äúoh excuse me‚Äù or ‚Äúsorry to disturb you‚Äù just abrupt questions.  VERY RUDE!!

My husband and kids had just left me to get food. I decided to stay in the car with our baby. My husband had gone no longer than 2 mins before this lady had opened my car door, and abruptly interrogated me.‚Äù

In addition, prior to this, she beeped and rudely waved her arms at another lady who was parked in the car park and getting on her bike to leave. The owner was clearly irritated this lady was taking up her spot.

I would not recommend this place, and felt very uncomfortable in the owners presence.

Another reason not to visit. My children‚Äôs food took one hour and 10 mins and arrived very dry and over cooked. The kids left it after a few bites. I don‚Äôt blame them.

I‚Äôve read reviews and this lady tries to justify every negative feedback , there are quite a few. And it‚Äôs also sad and hypocritical that these guys claim to be ‚ÄúEco‚Äù and there for the environment and our health yet use canola oil ‚Ä¶ hmmm. They even try to justify this.

Ps . I left a review prior to this but the owner had it removed."
