Kubu, Kabupaten Karangasem, Bali 80864, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=14650549035815379890,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.4,81,,Nice plain that looks like African savannah. No fee but a bit dangerous narrow path with locals and trucks driving. Good place for photos not swarmed by tourists or anyone really.,"Excellent spot for viewing Agung and the surrounding countryside. Batur, Kintinani and the Bali Sea are also viewable from here.
Worth a visit","Out of 3 savanas in Karangasem area, personally I like Nusu better than Tianyar or Tulamben. Good access for car, amazing view (you can see ocean, savana & mountain!), not crowded with tourists. To feel savana vibe, come during dry season. If you come on rainy season like I did last time, the savana turned green! :)",It’s a very pretty area and the view was OK but I honestly wouldn’t go out of my way to view it.,"A savannah located nearby cement company. View was nice, no entrance fee but I got embarrassed while taking pictures here as locals keep looking at me whilst passing by."
