The air conditioning system worked extremely well.

Clean.

The staff were not very friendly.

The breakfast was bland.","This was one of our favorite places to stay. The hotel garden is beautiful and comfortable. The hotel is located in the middle of nature and close to the coast. The room was clean, there was drinking water and air conditioning. Staff was very friendly! The food was good.","Quiet and clean hotel. They run a good restaurant. Aircondition and hot water works well. Internet is a bit slow.
But loud speaker from mosque at 5 AM almost 30 minutes made us unable to sleep.","This place probably one of the best place in pekutatan area. The price was incredible good, quiet and far from everywhere. The hotel has restaurant to make sure we are not hungry. The room very clean, big, the bath room very nice. The staff very kind and helpful. They will help us to get motorbike rent and also good helmet. The area just about 10 mins walk to the beach. The beach very quiet and nice.. local people who lived in this area also very very nice","Welcome drink, nice breakfast options, comfortable room, friendly staff, short walk to interesting beach... great value for the price, would come again.  Note, during Ramadan there is nearby temple loudspeaker from 5am+ that you will hear in the room."

Free well functioning wifi.","Pigged out at this Warung which is in the same grounds as the accommodation. Simple, good and cheap Indonesian meals, Loved the fries, couldn't get enough of them.  Had vego meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Hope to go back in the future, like that part of Bali, few tourist, some expats.","Food here is really the worst in Bali. No taste at all. Juice fruit, coffee, nasi goreng, vegetables are horrible.",
