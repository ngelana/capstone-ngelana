We bought our tickets for the temple entrance and about midway through our wait, we walked back down to this restaurant, had lunch and walked back up to the temple (to continue our wait).

This restaurant is conveniently located at the foot of the hill. It’s clean and the service is excellent.

There’s a lot of international food choices. Balinese, American and European. As well as, fresh juices, sodas and alcoholic drinks.","Amazing fries, the rest was sadly not that good. The prices were way to high for the quality, the service was very inattentive, it took 20 minutes, hand waving and in the end even loud calling to only get the menue. And the restaurant wasn't even busy. Same with some extra order and the bill. And when I ordered the fit breakfast, it contained a Bali coffee for 35k but I wanted a cappuccino (55k), they said then I would have to pay extra, which in my opinion should've been the difference of 20k, instead they charged me 35k extra.. the fries are the only thing we liked here, very much, but we won't come back.","Food was cold and rubbery, breakfast portions are small. Juices were watery, only the coffee was good.","Great place to relax and wait your turn for the photo op. Cappuccino, BLAT, and club sandwich were pretty good.","Good restaurant on way to Gates of heaven, we ordered margarita pizza and asked them to add some veggies the food was good staff was friendly, view was amazing and cafe also has some photo spots were you can get yourself clicked, if you are having something in the restaurant then its free else there is a small price that needs to be paid for the photo spots"

If you are looking for such amazing veg/Vegan options then this place is must recommended. If were group of 10 people and were amazed to find some Veg food near to Gate of Heaven temple. We ordered Pan cakes, Hot chocolates, Veg Samosa(Indian snacks). They had a very good service, people where kind and friendly and the food was good. You might have seen many Instagram photos with the similar probs and its free for people who have food over there. And also you get the amazing Mount Agung view from this place.",€7 for one beer and one cola. Had to pay separate for toilet aswell. Menu looked like sht and staff was not very friendly 1/5.,"The place is good as well as the service,but the food was low quality. Don't recommend.","cheap, delicious, friendly. a good place to rest after you climb to the top of the lempuyang temple",Ok
