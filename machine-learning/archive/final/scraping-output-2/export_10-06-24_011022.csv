Upon entering, it was a very nice atmosphere with an amazing 2 person band playing live music for the customers. The food was also delicious and affordable. We ordered the Avocado Spring Rolls, Greek Salad, BBQ Tuna Skewers, and Red‚Äôs Pomelo Bowl - we would recommend each and every one of these. Tuna Skewers came with the most delicious homemade BBQ sauce. The staff was also very friendly and attentive with fast service.",I had the Red Pomelo Burger and my wife had the Beef Burger. They were both delicious! We came here last year as well and had to come back! Highly recommend stopping here for lunch or dinner. Sounds like all the food here is good.,"The reason why I rate this place so highly is because it‚Äôs the only place on the island that doesn‚Äôt charge you an arm and a leg. Yes, I understand that Nusa Penida needs to import everything but still, why does this place have regular prices? Also, there‚Äôs only a few places that actually has cocktails and this is one of them. The other place is amok sunset which is also amazing but overpriced. The food is perfectly fine for decent western food, the atmosphere is great, staff is helpful and I can‚Äôt really say anything better, because Nusa Penida has very little to offer for restaurants and bars. We had the burger, fish and chips, and spaghetti. All decent. I just give this place a great review because there‚Äôs nothing better near Kelingking.",Very good place to eat. I ate Carbonara and my husband ate Beef Burger. We had banan spilt dessert and I am very happy choosing this restaurant. I recommend this in Nusa Penida. Best restaurant in Nusa Penida.,"Wow. I literally can't believe how good a meal can make me feel ü´®. I've been in Bali for 60 days, and somehow, right before my visa expires, I make it to this wonderful restaurant, and have what was, no joke, the best meal I'd had in 60 days. It was mind blowing good. I know this sounds dramatic and maybe it's because of the vibes and good day I had, but seriously, it was unreal. I wish I took a picture of the Creamy Chicken Mushroom Fettuccine I had, but I recommend it SO MUCH. I needed a late dinner, and the wonderful chef here really blew me away. So so happy to come here and have such a fresh tasting HOT meal. Wow. Such great prices, SO MUCH better than the ones by the port and dive shops. I really wish the best for everyone involved here. Will come back tomorrow."

Homemade breakfasts consisting of scrambled eggs, omelette with toast or banana pancakes with fresh fruit and coffee/juice were delicious. Putu was very helpful suggesting sites to see, places to eat, organising day trips or tickets for experiences, and driving us around or available scooter hire. Rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable with good air conditioning and wifi. Thanks for everything üòÅ","My  other half and I stayed seven nights here. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better homebase. Air quality, cleanliness, breakfast was all superb. The bed was so comfy and the  hosts (husband & wife) had such an amazing hospitality. The scooter rental was 70 K and his mother sells water and patrol a minute left from Mountain cottage for a great price.  Hosts had a dog which was very friendly and quiet. One thing to add was the walls were paperthin so keep in mind to be respectful of your neighbors.  location was ideal half hour from the sites and a 13 minute walk or three minute scooter ride down to the best food on the island- vegan soul kitchen. Overall you will not regret staying at the mountain cottages!","We enjoyed our stay here. The owners were really friendly, nice location. It‚Äôs very near Vegan Soul Kitchen where we ate every day. Haha. We got breakfast at the cottage. Fruit was the only option for us we enjoyed it.","Our stay here on Nusa Penida island was so hospitable! Putu was so kind to us and made an amazing breakfast consisting of omelette, fruit juice, and toast. When we arrived, there was a beautiful bedspread waiting for us and we were so impressed at the care and time he spent in making our stay enjoyable. We were able to get transport to this location fairly easily and Putu also has motorbikes for rental for 70,000rp per day, which made traveling the island very convenient as we could come and go as we pleased. If you‚Äôre planning on biking, know that the roads are uneven and sometimes extremely steep so be careful!","Wonderful spot in the mountains of nusa penida, giving easy access to both sides of the Island. Mr Komang and his lovely family are always here to help in any way. There is everything we needed in the room, the bed is great and the air conditionner works perfectly. You can directly rent a scooter in the hotel which is very convenient. You can order breakfeast a day before depending on when you want to wake up which makes you feel like home."

Putu was one of the most incredible host I have ever met, friendly and helpful","""You get what you pay for"". Here you get so much more. Putu, the guy managing the place, is incredibly kind and helpful. He booked our ferries in and out of Nusa Penida. He made sure our laundry was done, he got us a scooter, he got us a taxi, he sent us lots of places to visit. All for a better deal than we would manage on our own.
The rooms had the basic amenities, nice shower, good view from the balcony. The bed was comfortable. Breakfast was delivered on request with no extra charge. We'll definitely come back here!","The manager and his team are highly accommodating and helpful. They constantly and relentlessly ensure that we feel at home and somewhat meet our expectations or needs. The room is adorable and spacious, and the view is great. On top of that, it is equipped with a kettle which is seldom in Indonesia. The water was hot, and the pressure was strong. The WIFI worked properly. They clean the room every day and provide a complimentary breakfast, which is delicious.
The wildlife is part of the package... during the night, birds invade the roof and make quite a bit of noise.","Positive
- Beautiful  little place (4 Bungalows) to stay, with an amazing view !
- Lovely, friendly staff,
- Rooms getting cleaned daily.
- Got asked every afternoon what/when  we would like to have Breakfast.
- secured as gate is closed during the night,

Suggestions
- Having a fridge in the room would be a big plus.
- lovely idea with the lose rocks in the shower, can be a bit hard sometimes to move in the shower ( a fixed level of rocks would be a bit more save,(shower is directed into the bathroom, be careful , slippery)  :)

All in all a beautiful place to stay
Thank you","It couldnt be more perfect and nice. We are a couple from Argentina that stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. Breakfast was delicious, Putu was the best host ever. Thanks for everything"

Short ride from harbour. Room is clean and spacious with good aircon. Big bathroom with tub and separate rain shower. Nice breakfast every morning served by wonderful host. They can recommend and arrange activities like snorkelling, etc. Also have scooters for rent and even brought to harbour for me on my arrival. Highly recommended. Thanks üôèüèº","We have stayed at Wahyu Masari Homestay for three nights, and we have really enjoyed our time there. The homestay is very well located and only a short drive from major attractions on the island. The rooms are very clean and equipped with quiet AC units. The breakfast is hearty. There is also a possibility to rent a motorbike, which is very convenient. You can pay by cash or card.

But what we loved the most were the hosts: a very nice local couple, who not only gave us plenty of tips regarding what to visit on the island, but also recommended which routes to take (good if you are using a motorbike and want to avoid bad roads). The hosts also arranged a Manta Ray snorkeling trip for us and offered us a lift to the harbour. We really did feel like at home.","We couldn't be happier with our stay at Kadek's place. She was the best hostess we had on our trip arround Indonesia, gave great advice as how to visit Nusa Penida and took care of our motorcycle, taxi and boat tickets to Bali. She keeps a clean, beautifull and cozy homestay, the villas are big, clean and very comfortable, with a small terrace where she serves the best banana pancakes we ever had and an amazing coffee for breakfast.","The best place we have stayed on our 5 month trip so far! You get a lot of value for your money. Best of all was the sweet couple who own the place, they made us feel very comfortable and taken care of. They offer the best and cheapest snorkel trips and a mixed trip to see the east and west sides of the island. This was definitely the highlight of our stay here on Nusa Penida. We can highly recommend Wahyu Masari Homestay.","5 stars because I can't put 6! Rooms are a great deal: spacious, comfy bed and huge tasty breakfast üòé. But the best of all was our host Kadek who went way beyond we imagined during our stay. She gave us a lot of advice and even took us to the harbour herself because I hurt my elbow and couldn't drive properly! Honestly one of our highlights during our holidays"

The hosts were lovely and helpful. The echo lodge allows you to fill your water bottle for free, which is a nice addition. They also sell bamboo straws, although at a premium price.

One point of improvement for me would be to abstain from supplying the visitors with plastic-packaged soap and promote the use of more-or-less single-use toothbrushes. They could simply not provide them as a statement of sustainability, or provide a more sustainable soap-dispenser in the bathroom.

Overall very recommendable.","Perfect place to relax, find peace and have good food.
The bungalows in the jungle are so cute, we had a comfortable matress and it was very good, that there was a mosquito net.
All in all you cand find a peaceful atmosphere there and enjoy some time in the (almost) origin of the nature. Loved it!","Very nice place located in a quiet location. Friendly and helful staff, nice rooms and good food for a reasonable price","Friendly stuff until we had something to complain. Dirty rooms and blankets. Furthermore the moskito net over the bed doesn't keep the insects away. Very expensive prices in the restaurant. But the smoothies were really good and worth the money. The lady offered to refill our bottles, but didn't say anything  at the beginning that we have to pay for the water. On the description of booking was something totally different claimed - promised to have a whirlpool and other fancy facilities but in reality when we arrived there was none of it except of the hot water in the bathroom and wifi.",Beautiful place to stay in the middle of the jungle. They make very good food and the service is very good.

There was actually only one room available upon arrival and no breakfast. As soon as we entered the room one of us fell down because one of the stairs was broken.

Besides that mess the staff was friendly.","Stayed here at 9 april 2021 for 2 nights since everything closed due The Praying Day. Owner kindly enough to accept my last minute request.

Turned out it was the best location that i need:
10 minutes to Harbour
10 minutes to Kelingking Beach
30 minutes to Peguyangan waterfall

Pros:
Room was clean, Big comfy bed, spacious room, huge shower, wifi, and aircon
Swimmingpool's really clean
Breakfast's really yummy, fried noodles and fried rice made by owner :)
They also have store next door so it's really convenient to buy everything that i need: beers, mineral water, etc with fair price

Cons:
i should have stayed longer if i haven't booked my return ticket to Sanur. Nusa penida is so much to see.

Definitely will recommend this to friends and i will come back and stay","Allowed us to waive the booking fee, really forthcoming. Thank you.",Lovely place hidden up the mountain but close enough to the speedboat harbour. Friendly owners.,Great Bungalow near by to crystal bay
