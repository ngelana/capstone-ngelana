This was not our first stay here. It‚Äôs always clean, well maintained, welcoming and well presented.

All the staff are polite and efficient, and will go beyond the basic to help you. The rooms are spacious, well appointed, clean and comfortable. Beds are very comfy!

The restaurant and cafe are very good, the food is of a high standard, breakfast is awesome.

The pools are large and clean and well maintained. Service around the pool is prompt and efficient.

It‚Äôs a great location. The beach club is a short beach path walk away but there is also a free bus to take you. It‚Äôs a short walk multiple other shops, bars and restaurants.

We have already booked to return again.","Whilst we enjoyed our lovely stay I don‚Äôt think this classifies as 5 star. Nothing made it terrible it just lacked luxury that would make it a 5 star. For the price we paid we were happy though and I‚Äôd stay again for same price. Pros - great pools, shuttle bus to a nice beach area, our housekeeper Yoga made great towel creations for the kids, everyone friendly. Breakfast buffet had everything. Cons - noise can be an issue it echoes in from everywhere. It didn‚Äôt ruin our stay but we noticed. Nothing stocked in a mini bar, no milk for tea. Just those small things. No usb charge sockets had to buy indo adapter. Staff can be slow to respond and cocktails were hit and miss. If you‚Äôre happy go lucky and don‚Äôt want to break the bank it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable. If you‚Äôre looking for total luxury 5 star it‚Äôs not your place.","Pros: The location is perfect if you want to explore and walk around Nusa Dua. There is a shuttle bus to the beach and to Bali collection ( lots of shops and restaurants). The personnel is very friendly and attentive. Rooms are very clean.

Cons: Food and drinks are as expensive as in western countries ( Bali suppose to be an affordable travel destination). Eating out nearby the hotel is less than 50% than hotel prices.

The noise in the rooms is really bad, at least in the level that we stayed ‚Äúlevel 2‚Äù. I could hear the next room people taking showers and banging the doors really hard.","This establishment has exceeded expectations with cleanliness, service, location, food service etc etc‚Ä¶

The only aspect of disappointment has been that this establishment does not support video streaming, so whilst I can text and email on the in-house wifi, I am unable to access any video streaming platforms, which nearly prevented me from viewing my nana‚Äôs funeral which was live streamed.

This caused great distress in the minutes leading up to the start of the service. I was fortunate that I had access to a personal phone that had data roaming‚Ä¶ but my anxiety experienced at this very sensitive time was unacceptable.

An establishment that is apart of the Global Marriott network has greatly disappointed my expectations of service delivery in an area of modern technology that should be a basic requirement and service for a modern hotel.","Exceeding your expectations. Reasonable rate for the services provided. Nice-clean-well maintained rooms, cozy restaurant ambience, lovely pool atmosphere, and warm-friendly staffs. We had a very supportive staff at the resto, Putu Adhika Yasa that told us everything we want to know not just about the hotel, but Bali as well. We only have some notes about the taste quality of the menu though. We are really sure that some improvements can be done related to the foods taste."

There is a day spa in the hotel which was so relaxing.the restaurant had buffet dinning changing the theme each night. A bus comes evey 15min to the beach club where the cocktails are the very best and the staff members are friendly and chatty thankyou to the 2 young boys for wanting to practice some Aussie slang with us.shopping is close by with more restaurants there is a Cafe attached which sells delious donuts and coffee. Smal circle K attached for all your needs. Can walk to many massage places and street shopping is close by.  All the food I ate at this hotel I can give a 10 out of 10 only the highest quality. We will be back again and again.,"We enjoyed spacious 1 bedroom apartment, daily room service, Pause Cafe is excellent, their food is so much better than at the restaurant, we loved pastries and cakes, the staff is amazing.
Our kids enjoyed junior spa experience which adds that special touch.

Unfortunately, the reality was far from my expectations. The hotel appears old and poorly maintained, which was immediately evident from the condition of the facilities.

Upon entering my room, I was greeted by an unpleasant odour and soon discovered ants in various areas. For a hotel that claims a 4-star status, this lack of basic cleanliness is unacceptable. Additionally, the room and the general ambiance felt outdated and neglected, which detracted significantly from my overall comfort.

The hotel's lobby was uncomfortably hot, lacking air conditioning‚Äîa surprising oversight for a property in such a warm climate and one that claims to offer premium services. This made the time spent in the lobby areas quite unpleasant.

Breakfast, which one usually looks forward to in such accommodations, was underwhelming. The food quality and variety did not meet the standards of a 4-star hotel, or even a 2-star establishment.","1. The hotel upgraded our room to a pool-facing one and even did some beautiful artwork with bath towels and flowers.
2. The hotel provides free transport to the nearby beach in a very convenient golf cart. The hotel has earmarked space at the beach for the comfort of its guests complete with a beach lounge
3. The breakfast menu was diverse
4. The hotel offered to extend our stay which we opted for (charges extra per hour)",Nice resort with good facilities and a private area on Nusa Dua beach. Breakfast is very good and offers at the restaurant are quite nice too. Staff is friendly and welcoming and try to help as much as they can. Had a wonderful stay here.,Room was not spacious for deluxe. Just ok. Have backside door to enjoy the view. The AC is cool enough and comfortable to stay.Not having much variety for the breakfast but overall is OK. They do providing halal food.,"High profile hotel with run down rooms but friendly and professional staff. The location is amazing, close to restaurants, laundry services, supermarkets. Several beaches within walking distance. The staff will do their best to assist you with anything.

The gym is the best one i have ever seen in a hotel. Its a separate building and you can do an actual full workout with all the equipment they have. Its not particularly big, 3 people makes a crowd, but well cooled and equipped.

The pool seems quite small for a hotel of this size. The breakfast was fine, small buffet with an egg station.

The rooms are the weakest point of the hotel. Poor sound isolation means you hear all noise your neighbours make. Woe to you if your upstairs neighbours are people who never sat on chairs before and keep moving them around to find out the workings of the great four legged contraptions. My balcony was occupied by the AC. There is no single switch to turn off all the lights. During a particularly severe rainstorm there was a flood on my floor which also led to water coming into my room.

Though the rooms could be better, all in all my stay was not bad."

I don't usually eat chicken but had to make an exception for this gem. Even took seconds!!

My fiance has very particular standards and she was savouring every bite of her sate lilit!

Dropped a pin and will be back.","We ordered the food online through the Grab App. The food was delicious as compared to  the food that we ordered room service from the hotel's restaurant as our first lunch in Bali after we checked in our hotel/Villa.

The Ayam Betutu (with sauce) was very good. They used the old chicken or kampung chicken I was not sure. But the meat was tender and cooked in a unique mix of spices. It was spicy and tasty, but we enjoyed it very much. The Ayam Betutu did not come with the rice.

The Nasi Ayam Campur, chicken (a little bit dry compared to the Ayam Betutu) with vegetable long beans was good and the onion sambal was quite spicy.","After our arrival to Nusa Dua we found that it was catered to tourism a fair bit, we asked our grab driver for a recommendation on where the locals eat and he recommended this place.

A short trip from our hotel to this local eatery and it‚Äôs a very basic set up. Perfect.
The ordering system is pretty easy for tourists, rather spicy or not spicy, not sure exactly what‚Äôs on the menu prior to ordering but it seems to be fried chicken of some sort according to the locals and google translate.

I ended up ordering the spicy version and my partner got the non spicy version. Seems to come with a skewer and some chicken and rice plus the sauce which is the spicy part of it.  Overall the food is pretty good, the chicken if you‚Äôre not familiar with culture is very similar to how you would find in most south east Asia locations where it is what it is, the chicken was chopped and it wasn‚Äôt just thigh or breast, it‚Äôs bone and all, my partner got a leg and I got a section of the breast. Overall fantastic flavours, loads of spices and very tasty, could‚Äôve been more meat but still a light and balanced meal. Super cheap, came up to 70k with 2 cokes. I‚Äôd rate this place a solid 8.2/10.","We were the first customer. Went there while they were still setting up so no queue and the shop attendants were pleasant and nice. However as we were eating, the crowd was trickling in. The food is good and flavourful. The spices were aromatic and the portions decent. Definitely must order the 'sedang' or the 'spicy' version to enjoy the goodness of the spiced chicken.","Never had such a local food like this before.
Good environment, strategic place, cheap price."

The resort itself was amazing! So much to do in the resort and the pool and breakfast were amazing.

Nusa Dua is probably not the place for people looking for clubs and partying but it was fantastic for staying with my family. The resort itself was quiet, the staff friendly, the facilities great. Staying at The Gardens meant we could access the Courtyard pool too. I found the resort less busy than other places and we could always get a chair easily. The kids enjoyed the kids club and the whirlpool was always a favourite. The beds are really comfortable and the sofa in the lounge folds out to be a sofa bed. Great resort if you want to just relax and chill. 5 min walk to a row of shops and restaurants outside.","Loved our stay at Marriott's Bali Nusa Dua Gardens! Three pools, including a lazy river, kept my daughter entertained for hours. Even has indoor and outdoor kids clubs! We scored a ground floor room by the lazy river - perfect for poolside fun with the little one. Plus, the location is ideal! Lots of convenient stores, massage spas, and delicious warungs nearby.

Lovely hospitality and great place to stay at Bali. Love the receptionist, Moon.

I ordered mixed beef and pork satay, and Balinese nasi campur.

Satay's presentation was great as it was served on a mini grill which made it look appetizing. Taste-wise, however, was a let down as the meat was dry-tough and the satay sauce was lacking. Sauce would have done better if there were crushed nuts and a tad spicier.

The Balinese nasi campur was forgetable as the meat too, was dry, and the sides didn't harmonize.

Such a great vibe for a romantic dinner or even family friendly. Definitely recommend if you're in the area. It's very good value for money too!
The only feedback is we we told the ""half"" chicken was a big meal - I'm guessing the chickens aren't that big in Bali, so if you're hungry, opt for the whole chicken option.","Great place, had a drink. Nice atmosphere, chilled music. The signature mocktail is great! Clean, very friendly service, good quality.

It was too good so we had to visit here almost everyday once or twice a day because of their good service as well as good coffee & food! Had to get takeaway food to bring it to beach as well lol! If you are in Nusa Dua this is the local place to visit, staffs are really friendly and helpful too! Their google review is too low compare to real experience you can get! Thumbs up and highly recommend!!!","Lia, our server was very nice and their menu has a great selection. Our food and drinks came out quick and delicious.

The place is very spacious, cozy and serene. It is done with such good taste and is absolutely gorgeous. Food was great and the mushroom sushi was one of the best I have tried. The soba noodles were also great. They have vegetarian options but not too many when it comes to main course. The staff came across as bit disinterested. I would still recommend this place if you like Japanese food in a Japanese look alike set up.","We are foodies from Singapore and we love our flavourful and creative sushi rolls. We also treat our reviews seriously. We stumbled upon Kagura by searching for Sushi roll on Google map and I was lured in because I saw that it had hotel transfer for dinner service and the pricing is a lot more competitive than the insanely overpriced Japanese restaurants residing within the hotels in the Nusa Dua district. We tried RIN at Conrad hotel that had somewhat good reviews and were very disappointed.

Overall, I give a 5/5 for the 3 x sushi rolls that we had + the salmon belly (generous portion)! We had the Catapiaro Roll (Signature roll), Scorpion Roll (Signature) & Dragon Roll and all 3 of the hit the spot! We also had a complimentary banana spilt and it was great as well.

Service was attentive and responsive. I called to arrange for dinner service hotel pickup at 6pm and the staff was prompt to facilitate throughout. We had an infant with us too and the crew took note of it and prepared the baby chair in advance to our arrival. They also remembered that I mentioned that I wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary.

The dining atmosphere was great as well. Spacious, clean, dim lit and cosy environment.

We are looking to change our restaurant dining schedule to revisit Kagura again. If only we discovered it earlier.

If you got to this part of the review, look no further if you want to have authentic, delicious and price competitive Japanese food in Nusa Dua. The other good alternatives will be at Kuta area, more than 20 minutes drive away.

Hopefully this review will help you!

*2nd review: We visited Kagura again for lunch and was pleasantly surprised that they offered hotel transfer for lunchtime too. Unsure if they will continue this service during peak travelling periods as we are here in March and it seems like a lull period.

This time, we had 4 x rolls, the mushroom roll, Salmon Avocado roll, and repeated the Catapiaro Roll and Scorpion Roll. The mushroom roll was novel and covered with crispy tempura for added texture. The Salmon Avocado roll had cream cheese and was on par with the Scorpion Roll (the best one in our opinion).

We were also surprised with complementary ice cream (2 scoop) for being return customers (again not sure if this is the norm!).","I stopped by to eat some neat Japanese food.
The tofu avocado salad is small in quantity, but light and delicious.
squid sugatayaki is not tough and is easy to eat.
As shown in the mix sashimi picture, the amount is very small, so if you really, really want to eat sashimi, order it with anticipation.
I don't recommend mix sushi because it tastes bland, like it's not made well, and the rice grains are weak.
The miso soup was a bit disappointing. I think you could give it as a service rather than putting it on the menu.
The portion size was very small, so two people visited and ate 6 dishes.","Fast service, warm welcoming from the staffs, big portion and reasonable price. Always passing by this restaurant but never dine in .... until 31.12.23 we had dinnere there. Surely will go back when we are in nusadua area","If I could give a ten star I would!  The food is fantastic and the service is fast. The sashimi is so thick, cold and fresh.  The fried squid is amazing. As is everything else we have tried.  It‚Äôs our second day coming here. We wish we had found it earlier. Love everything about this place.  We have had lunch and dinner here. The sake is super yummy too!  Miso soup was filled with tofu and seaweed‚Ä¶"

The staff speaks very good English and everyone is very attentive, kind. My husband ordered food but didn‚Äôt eat much, our server immediately paid attention and asked if the food tasted good, otherwise she would ask the kitchen to remake it, and when we told her the reason was him not feeling well, she offered to give him a cup of tea with ginger, honey‚Ä¶, that touched our hearts.

It's the thinnest steak I've ever had. Only the plate is big‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm not sure they measured proper portion.
They only gave me six fried calamari that I ordered.
The bread served as a base is too cheap and tacky, and the salad dressing is not dressing oil, just cooking oil.

Both Carpaccio Manzo and Pesce are such delicate and refined starters and pairs well with Pizza Magherita. The Roast Beef and grilled chicken are lightly seasoned, succulent and refreshing.

They served their own homemade limoncello at the end of the meal, it was very delicious.

We only found the pizza dough unsalted and a bit hard, which may be specific to that day. thank you for everything, good job!","Just returned from Bali and we were staying a 5 mins walk from Ganzos.
