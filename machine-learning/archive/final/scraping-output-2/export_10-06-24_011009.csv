The Sup Kepala Ikan assam was yums and flavourful. The Fried tenggiri was on point too. Fresh and no fishy taste. I was looking forward to the Telur Ikan but I think this could've done with a bit more frying. Overall - good!! No frills. Staff were sharp and fast.","Many people compared this with the popular one : Mak Beng Sanur. But i thought it was different. Mak Beng has one menu only, and Bambu Lulu has various menu altough its special menu is Sop Kepala Ikan, the same dish with Mak Beng.

For me, Mak Beng still the best if we talk about the taste. I didnt say Bambu Lulu was bad. It tastes delicious, but Mak Beng for me was beyond.

+ has musala (small mosque).
+ various menu. I really wanna try the egg fish so bad
+ bigger space than Mak Beng
+ has indoor room. Seems full AC, but i dunno it for special reservation or no.

- still not smoking free
- no special attraction. While Mak Beng just 10 walks from Sanur beach.
- Cashier located in a tiny room. It was a struggle if crowded.","Had a lunch there, simple place with good Indonesian food.
Nothing fancy here, come for their fish and seafood dishes if you like Indonesian tasty food.
Fish soup are super good, fried fish as well.
I recommend their fried noodles if you like noodles, best I had since while !
The place seams to be always busy, mainly locals, almost no tourists here.
Next time around, will def come back !
Recommended üëçüëçüëç","they mainly sell seafood dishes but they also have some dishes that don't use any kinds of seafood like fried rice, and fried vermicelli.

the sour and spicy fish soup is a little too sour for my liking. there's nothing wrong with the dish, it's just i'm not really into sour, but since it's their signature dish, i would like to try. the fish is really soft and tender though. i might order the fried fish next time.

the fried calamari has too much batter, but the calamari itself is tasty and not overcooked. the stir fried kangkong is good to eat with the seafood.

they have different kinds of dining rooms, one with air cons, and one with electric fans. the owner is very friendly and patient. the waiters are helpful too.",Less touristy area but accessible within the main road.  Food was delicious. There were plenty of seats available even in the afternoon. Ordered Fish Head Soup with rice and fried fish. Both of it had plenty of meat. Rice may be a little small on the portion.

Looks like I'm about to break my streak of never giving a 1-star review. Brace yourself, because this one's a doozy.

Picture this: after a grueling 6-hour drive, we finally roll up to the Hotel at the ungodly hour of 2 AM. And what do we get? A room that reeks like nobody's business. If I had to put it into words, it's like we stumbled upon the lair of a sweaty chain-smoker who hasn't showered in a week. Yuck!

Now, let's talk about the bed. Oh boy, the bed. It's not just any ordinary bed, my friend. It's a vibrant mix of yellow and brown, like a failed attempt at a DIY tie-dye project (it should be white!!!!). And trust me, I know my tie-dye, being the girly pop that I am. But this is definitely not it. And if you dare touch it, prepare to feel a delightful combination of sand and stickiness. Joy!

But wait, there's more! The floor, the sofa, the chair - sticky, sticky, and sticky. And don't even get me started on the furniture, water faucet, etc.

Now, here's the kicker. I had booked this place for three whole days, only to check in at 2 AM and check out at 4 AM on the same day. Two hours of frantically calling other hotels to find an alternative. Talk about a wasted booking, and to make matters worse, it's non-refundable. Lucky me, right?

Just to clarify, I'm not some obsessive-compulsive neat freak. I actually enjoy traveling to rural areas quite a bit. But this experience? Let's just say it was far from charming.","Furious at this property, false advertising since the expectation doesn‚Äôt meet. Room is moist, the floor humidity trace visible, everything cracked on the wall, the fridge they don‚Äôt even bother to clean, the shower handle was broken, sink is broken, the bed is smelled like haven‚Äôt been washed and the couch is really dirty, overall isn‚Äôt a proper accommodation to be rented. They should have renovated in the first place before they opened it again for clients to come. Foremost the Traveloka should have been checked out before they put it on their website since their hold for responsible as the owner did. Pictures are trafficked to deceived the clients. I demand to be rembourse and  get paid for the damage for this false advertisement.","Booked this room for holiday nyepi while partner and I are in between villas. DO NOT STAY HERE. SCAM!!! Save your money. Where do I begin, Our room key was so bent and twisted we were worried it would break trying to get the door open, which we had to body slam each time to get it to force open. The back door wouldnt close or latch, so anyone can easily just walk in by pool area. The room has a bad smell. Musty, moldy, damp. The walls are moldy and the wallpaper is tearing off. Bugs are eating away at the walls and trim (where there is any). The white bed sheets are stained all over and ripped, did not seem clean or maintained at  all. Not even real mattress cover, just a sheet draped over mattress. No hot water in shower in 6 days, not even ‚Äúwarm‚Äù, COLD. Water shoots out of the wall. Kettle is very worn and has a film, not cleaned. They don‚Äôt offer refunds or consolidation so I wouldn‚Äôt bother. They know what they are doing. The WiFi barely works, and there was no cell service for me either. On the silent day, children were screaming in the pool area all morning and afternoon, we were woken up early multiple times (7am/8am).",This might be one the worst hotels I have ever stayed in my life. It was so bad that I booked 5 night and had to leave after checking in and in room for 4 hours.. the back sliding door would not lock or close. I brought to staff attention and they came and  inspection and claimed it was locked.. after slighted force the door would open. Staff then said if your curtains are closed no one will open door. The walls were disgusting and falling a part.  They put a coffee tea tray to hid a giant gaping hole in the counter in kitchenette. Couch was stained all over the place. Stained sheets. Dirty carpet. Dirty and stained furniture. The front door had to be rigged with some cheap wood . I asked staff why and she simply said yesterday a customer... and couldn't finish the explanation.  This poor girl was too young and too inexperienced to be in any form of help or authority. I asked to speak to boss or manager and was told there not there. I asked when will return and was told I don't know. I asked who is in charge then. And was told i don't know. I was shown 3 other rooms all just as bad as the rest. In pretty sure there were rats in the walls as well. The bathroom was dirty. Toilet seat was black and brown. Half roll of tissue paper for toilet. Kitchenette was disgusting and old. Bugs in plain sight. A sense of clueless was obvious. Pictures did not match the room. The hotel has a no refund policy in place because they know how bad their establishment really is. I never go this far to even review. Hotel but this was by far very bad. Do not saty here. Unless you want to feel dirty and disgusting. Moldy walls and just in terrible shape all around. I truly feel bad for the staff who had to deal with my rage and anger they are not responsible for its the owner and management that is responsible. DO NOT STAY,"what a scam! moldy ceiling, stingy bed & pillows, dirty pool, cannot lock balcony door, cannot use the microwave & even the kettle has some used water in it, room also not cleaned properly.

I recently stayed at Sanur Seaview during my trip to Sanur Bali, and while there were some positive aspects, I encountered several concerning issues that impacted my overall experience.

On the positive side, the hotel boasts a beautiful pool area, perfect for relaxation, and its location is very convenient, just a two-minute walk to Metasari Beach. Additionally, the rooms are spacious and well-appointed, providing ample comfort during my stay.

However, I was disappointed to discover hygiene issues within the room. Behind the refrigerator, we found mold and even mushrooms were growing from it. Furthermore, the water dispenser showed signs of mold in its collection container. The cleanliness of the rooms is only superficially maintained.

Another aspect that detracted from my experience was the breakfast service. Waiting times were long, and the staff seemed indifferent to the guests' needs. The quality of the breakfast did not justify its high price, and it needed more attention to detail and care in its presentation. Given the price, it would have been preferable to dine elsewhere.

Moreover, the overall condition of the property seemed outdated and in need of renovation. Maintenance has been neglected, which impacts the overall ambiance and comfort of the stay.","Great value, great breakfast, great staff.
If you are staying here, I would highly recommend eating at the seafood restaurant just around the corner on the way to the beach. The hotel is a little way from the beach however the bicycles are free to use. Definitely worth getting up early and doing a 5 minute bike ride to see the sunrise.","Cheap hotel run by a guy called Agus . Really amazing man , extremely kind and caring with wonderful staff . It is a budget hotel so please understand this .","We booked a 2 bedroom villa  2 months ago for mid October. We received the confirmation email an everything. Last night we got a message saying. "" we do not have 2br villa available from mid oct. Our villa has been booked for a wedding  event ""

Then said they have a jr suite available.  If i wanted a hr suite i would have booked it.","Shocked to actually see the place after the terrific photos online, rundown and poorly furnished room, rusty bar fridge, no tea or coffee facilities in room. Tiny aircon hardly able to counteract the heat. Hard basic mattress and covers on bed.  Basic bathroom facilities. Room on the second floor looked out over a swamp like block next door, raising concern of mosquitoes. Quiet location with potential but requires a lot of refurbishment.Checked in at 2pm, called a taxi to pick me up at 5.30 and checked out, never to return."

Very authentic and kids friendly.

My daughter loves the plain roti canai üòä

Will always come back!!","So this is our second Warung Bunana location and we were looking for something delicious and since the first experience was so nice, we had high expectations.

This location is great because it has much more parking and seating than the location in Jimbaran. The kitchen also seems larger so there is more space to make food.

We quickly ordered a few roti and 1 teh tarek as we were hungry. We ordered one regular, one egg, and one garlic and onion. Teh came out pretty quick and shortly after the regular and egg one came out.

After about 15 minutes the garlic and onion came out. The guy taking the order didn‚Äôt even bother to check in to make sure we got all of our food.

So many tables that came after us received our food. Minus 1 star.

After waiting for the chef who was visibly rushing the making sent over a soggy undercooked roti that wasn‚Äôt crispy and just unpleasant as the onions were still raw.

We didn‚Äôt bother to make a comment because it was clear that the staff just didn‚Äôt care. No one apologized for the mistake and the flavor wasn‚Äôt up to par with the other location. Minus 1 star.

Will not be returning to this location."

Very bad.,"We stayed three nights in that accomodation. The hotel is located a little outside, which was the reason why we picked that hotel. So for us the location was top. It is a very calm area and we liked the swimmingpool and generally the green nature in that hotel. About the rooms i can mention, that they need an update. Many things are not state of the art anymore. Additionally i can say, that our room was clean and the bed very comfortable. A kitchen in the rooms (or sometimes outside) exists, but the amount of equipment in there is limited. So this would for me not be a reason to book that hotel. Besides that, the aircondition in the room was not strong enough. As a summary: the stay there was ok, but next time i would book another accomodation."

Room is clean and neat, toilet comes with hot showers too. The biggest win for me is the main common area with the beautiful lawn, pool and the company of the dogs (who will often appear when they smell your food). This place really made me feel like home, and i love that its rather spacious with multiple common areas, so that you can find a quiet spot when you feel like it.

Barbarossa Sanur is a restaurant that offers good food, excellent service, and an impressive drink list. While I enjoyed my dining experience overall, there were a couple of notable issues that need to be addressed.

Let's start with the positives. The food at Barbarossa Sanur is undeniably delicious. The menu features a variety of flavorful dishes that cater to different tastes. From appetizers to main courses, the culinary offerings are well-prepared and satisfying. The attentive service provided by the staff was also commendable, as they were friendly, helpful, and ensured that our needs were met throughout the meal. Additionally, the drink list boasts an impressive selection of beverages, including cocktails, wines, and non-alcoholic options, allowing guests to find a suitable drink to accompany their meal.

However, one significant drawback of Barbarossa Sanur is the poor ventilation within the restaurant. The smoke from the kitchen tends to flow into the main dining area, causing an unpleasant and uncomfortable dining experience. As a result, the smell of smoke lingers on our clothes even after leaving the establishment. This issue significantly detracted from the overall enjoyment of the meal and needs to be addressed to enhance the dining experience for guests.

Furthermore, it is important to note that Barbarossa Sanur lacks parking facilities. This can be inconvenient, as finding parking in the surrounding area can be a challenge, especially during busy hours. It would be beneficial if the restaurant could explore options to provide parking for their customers to alleviate this issue.

In conclusion, Barbarossa Sanur offers good food, excellent service, and an impressive drink list. However, the lack of proper ventilation, which results in the smoke from the kitchen flowing into the main dining room and leaving a lingering smell on clothes, is a significant concern. Additionally, the absence of parking facilities adds to the inconvenience for guests. Addressing these issues would greatly improve the overall dining experience at Barbarossa Sanur.","Came to this restaurant a couple of times and it never fails. The food here is awesome. We tried a few items from the menu and everything was super delicious. The cocktails are well made and authentic. We tried the special menu of the day and the lamb shank was just immaculate!
It‚Äôs not a big restaurant so reservations might be
needed.","We had the pleasure of dining at Barbarossa in Sanur, Bali, and we were absolutely blown away by the food and service. The restaurant is located in a quiet, residential area, just a short walk from the beach. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with a rustic, Mediterranean feel.

We started our meal with a complimentary tomato avocado bruschetta, which was perfectly cooked and delicious. For our main course, we ordered the diavola pizza, the mama's bolognese al sugo, and the paccheri alla carbonara. All three dishes were absolutely incredible. The pizza was cooked to perfection, with a crispy crust and a flavorful, spicy sauce. The bolognese was rich and creamy, with tender beef and a flavorful tomato sauce. The carbonara was creamy and decadent, with perfectly cooked pasta and a generous amount of guanciale.

The service at Barbarossa was also top-notch. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, and she was happy to make recommendations. She also offered us a taste of the wine before we made our selection, which was a nice touch.

We had such a wonderful dining experience at Barbarossa that we will definitely be back. If you're looking for a delicious and authentic Italian meal in Sanur, this is the place to go.

**Would you recommend this restaurant to a friend?**

Yes, I would definitely recommend Barbarossa to a friend. It is one of the best Italian restaurants I have ever been to. The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great dining experience."

Very highly recommended if you're in Sanur.",Thank you so much for everything.  We loved it here the breakfast was beautiful and the shower is the best I've had . Love to personal touches  you do with the pink his a hers pjs. The face masks.  Ther room was great and everything cannot fault it except maybe too far out from places for me but I'm old lol

The cottages are reachable through a 30 minute Grab ride and are easily accessible by road.

The ambience and vibe here is really laid back, and the room we booked was spacious and comfortable with a couple of bedrooms and two bathrooms (one outdoor and one indoor). They have an attached restaurant where you can eat meals, and our booking included breakfast

If I had one minor complaint with the rooms it is that the plug points are too close to the floor but it's far from a dealbreaker - just make sure you have the correct adapter and decently long wires","My stay at Bebe Cottages Sanur was nothing short of fantastic! Bubbles and I spent six delightful nights here and were thoroughly impressed. Despite being rated as a 3-star accommodation, it exceeded our expectations in every way. The rooms were not only comfortable but also impeccably clean, with the added bonus of air conditioning for those hot days. The pool was a refreshing oasis, perfect for escaping the humidity. However, what truly stole the show was the breathtaking garden and sculptures throughout the complex, masterfully designed by the renowned architect Michael Richard White (Made Wilayah). Each morning, we indulged in delicious breakfasts, with pancakes and French toast for me, and Bubbles couldn't get enough of the fried rice. The location couldn't have been better‚Äîclose enough to the action yet far away enough to enjoy peace and tranquility. If you're considering staying here, don't hesitate for a moment. We'll definitely be returning on our next visit to Sanur!","Small, quiet and beautiful with gorgeous gardens and pool. On a quiet side street close to the hustle of the boardwalk and the Sanur main streets with bars and restaurants if that‚Äôs your scene.

The rooms very comfortable, clean with comfortable beds beautiful large bathrooms and well appointed in general!

Ayu and her staff provide excellent, genuinely welcoming service!

The attached restaurant Warung Memeri is EXCEPTIONAL!!!

You don‚Äôt have to go far to enjoy truly exquisite local cuisine!! They serve the included breakfasts so you know meals will not disappoint and they are open for lunch. Super friendly service!!

Please be kind, ‚Äúglobal travel ambassadors‚Äù and tip generously (above the nominal service charge included in your bill). You won‚Äôt find better service!!","An amazing short stay at Bebek Cottage was the perfect choice for a quiet getaway for a change of scenery.  The location is quiet yet convenient. It‚Äôs a short 5 minute walk to the beach and promenade where there are many choices for dining, spa and water activities.  Head to the right away from the beach and you‚Äôll find some of Bali‚Äôs amazing creative talents; Carlos showroom, Philip Lake ceramics and Kevala where you can do a ceramics class in their studio.

One packed day with a sunset stroll by the beach and a light dinner along the promenade, sunrise walk, yummy breakfast and a swim in the beautiful gardens and pool at Bebek Cottage, a paddle through the boats moored in the bay and back to the cottage to pack up, get refreshed and head on my way.

The room was spacious, the bed and linens beautiful and comfortable and the gardens by Made Widjaya stunning with a wonderful collection of statues hidden amongst the tropical greenery.

Thank you for a beautiful one night get away.

Awesome pool, great staff, big rooms, and not too busy location, yet a lot of restaurants close by. Started our trip here and spent the last 6 nights there too because we just loved our time there so much!","Wonderful hotel to stay in, my family enjoyed staying hereü§© room are big also they‚Äôve got everything that we needed, their staff also are so nice to the guest. Might staying here again. Wanna extend the room but sadly its all booked, definitely 10/10","I loved staying with my family at The Bali Bubble! It was perfect for my family of 4. We had a spacious & clean 2 bedroom suite for about half the price of something comparable at a resort, with a porch that near the pool so we can supervise our kids' swimming fun. The general atmosphere was very relaxing and laid back. It almost has an Air B&B vibe. The staff is very friendly & helpful. Several of their services they contract out to trusted locals which is good as it equated to resort quality without resort prices. We took advantage of laundry service, massages, and shuttle transportation, all of which worked out great for us! Also the complimentary breakfast meals are delicious! Their Nasi Goreng (Indonesian Fried Rice) was the best meal I had my entire time in Bali.

I think main difference between this experience and a resort is that a resort would have a more pristine veneer and be right on the beach. The Bali Bubble is a long but doable walk to the beach. I did it a couple times with my whole family, and every morning by myself to catch the beautiful sunrises. The walk itself is quite enjoyable as it goes along a beautiful riverwalk and just walking around Bali is a novel experience for a foreign visitor.

The only negative about the hotel is we did have a decent number of mosquitoes in our room; although we didn't actually get bit much. Some of my kids also weren't fond of the shower being outdoors (its still private with high walls around it), but personally I enjoyed that.

I would definitely recommend The Bali Bubble to anyone visiting Bali. If I return, this is definitely the place I'll want to stay.","Lovely place with amazing staff! Spacious room, clean, delicious breakfast, nice pool and big smiles on everyone's faces. Internet connection was fine and overall it was great value for money. We got help from one of the guys working there getting SIM cards, they arranged laundry service for us, they gave us rides with their shuttle cars - everyone was more than welcoming and attentive. Walking to the beach or restaurants is a bit far and alongside traffic but this seems to be the case in most places we visited in Bali. Definitely recommended and thank you foe the wonderful stay!","+ the apartment is really large and equipped with all the necessary stuff
+ the staff is friendly and hospitable
+ very nice breakfast
+ large pool with toys for children
- occasional stains/spots on the room floor
- the rooms are facing the pool and the 1st bunch of children to come to play there in the morning would likely wake you up )"

Vietnamese restaurant serves great food and can bring to your room. I have a balcony overlooking the pool on the 2nd floor where I enjoy my lunch. I have nothing negative to say about Puri Messi, I highly recommend.","We stayed here for a quick night, and were very disappointed. The room was dirty and hot.
The AC lacked enough power to properly cool the room and with the bathroom being open air, it didn‚Äôt stand a chance cooling things down. So in conclusion it was a hot and sticky nights sleep.
The room smelt stale and our bed sheets were stained and off in color which made them seem dirty or unwashed. It also lacked proper bathroom linens and toiletries.
Although in Bali you will mostly always find wonderful friendly service which this hotel has, cleanliness it does not.
I think for a similar price there are many other more suitable options in the area. If we were here for more than just one night it would have been a deal breaker for our trip in Bali.","We had an amazing experience staying here, friendly and helpful staff.

Quiet place, spacious clean room, clean pool, and romantic bathroom, no toiletries but it's oke for us.

7 minutes to Mertasari beach by walk, nearby with many local food and coffee shop. Sure we'll recommend this to others.

This deserves more than a 5 Star rating!","Lovely boutique hotel that scores high in both hard and soft product. The rooms, while simple are spacious and very clean. The bed, linen, and pillows are comfortable and spotless. The staff are friendly and always ready to help if needed. The location is a short 5-10 minute walk to many restaurants, mini marts, and other businesses. There is a Vietnamese/vegan restaurant on site. A solid 5 stars in its price range.","Puri Mesari is a delight! I visited last week for 4 nights and really didn't want to leave. My friend was staying there and recommended it. As soon as I arrived a sense of calm came over me - it's like a sanctuary.  I kept marvelling at how serene and tasteful the property and rooms. I booked direct and the communication was easy and clear. The location is good, close enough to the beach to walk but also removed from the hustle. It's very quiet.
The pool is lovely and I swam every day. The facilities were excellent and the room and bed very comfortable. Can't praise the staff enough, they were a delight and so helpful. They dealt with all my queries (I am relatively new to Bali) including trying to sort out the Grab App so it didn't take me to the wrong place. No request for help was too big or small. I came to Puri Mesari after travelling for 5 weeks through Cambodia and Thailand for holiday and work so had some comparisons. Was easily the best place I stayed. The service surpassed everything I'd previously experienced and ended my trip on a high, before returning to Australia."

The Shrimp Summer Roll is fresh, filled with an abundance of refreshing herbs that pairs really well with the Nuoc Cham sauce ‚Äì I'm in love with it! The Banh Mi portion is quite generous; even after sharing it between two people, we felt comfortably full. The Cakwe was fried to crispy perfection, paired with the same Nuoc Cham sauce that I fell head over heels for. Just perfect!

A point for improvement: Although we know it's partly our fault for not reserving beforehand, the waiting time to get the menu was quite long. However, in fairness, our dishes arrived at a good pace once ordered.

Note for first-time diners: Reserving a table won't hurt. They also have limited parking space inside, enough for about three cars and ten or so motorbikes.
