Within a short scooter ride, there are shops, bars, and restaurants. The entire complex is situated on a hilltop, the houses are very nice and comfortable. The food is wonderful and the views by the pool are exceptional. I definitely recommend this place and will come back in the future.","We were left speechless. This is one of the most delightful places we have ever visited. Everything from the breathtaking view and convenient location to the delicious food and exceptional service was simply remarkable. In particular, Ira stood out with her xceptional friendliness, politeness, and helpfulness.","My family and I stayed here for 3nights and we absolutely enjoyed it! Love the sunset view from the swimming pool, all the staffs are friendly, food was amazing! We had a great experience there. Will definitely come back here for our next vacation in Bali","Impeccable hotel surrounded by lush nature and amazing staff! We spend 5days here but could have easily spent 10! The hotel is easily reachable by ride share services, check in was smooth and so was check out.
The pool had great vibes and the snacks there were delicious.
The rooms are comfortable, large and cleaned daily.
The restaurant has great views and intimate atmosphere for dinners.
Room service is available and fast, so is laundry, we used both and are very satisfied.
Really can't fault anything! Location is quiet and peaceful but all beach clubs are easy to reach within a short car or bike ride.","The Gr√ºn Resort was our first stop on our Bali trip and it couldn't have got off to a better start. Everything was perfect. From the extremely friendly staff, to the very tasty breakfast and the super uncomplicated Whatsapp service. Definitely worth a recommendation!"

The view is unbelievably beautiful, and extra special at sunset. It's a quiet place to enjoy (especially away from the crowded bars/beaches).

The team was very communicative - always with a smile on their face! Very helpful to book day trips/transport & provide suggestions.

Rooms were modern and comfy - BUT the door didn't lock properly. would recommend a scooter/gojek to get around. Nothing (yet) that is close by.

Would stay again! LOVED IT!","Disgraceful communication - in fact zero of it. Cancellation due to medical emergency and zero attempt made by the staff to accommodate this in light of all evidence shared. Lack of compassion and empathy in favour of greed.

Do not stay here and fill the pockets of these people","Great! Amazing location, very close to restaurants, cafe and most importantly Padang Padang. Perfect for a relaxing stay, very clean and spectacular views.

It‚Äôs a very practical place, you can fill your bottle of water on demand, they welcome you with a free drink, that you can enjoy by the pool looking at the best sunsets ever. Or your room. The room has all you need, a good bed with nice pillows (very appreciated) and excellent shower, you have a little walking closet where you can hang your things. Highly recommend to stay there if your go to Uluwatu!","Fantastic spot and staff, perched up on the hill in Uluwatu about 5 minutes into town.
So nice and quiet  if that‚Äôs what you like, but An easy commute down into town.
Plenty of bikes to hire as well as the residents has access a couple of drivers and easy to get a bluebird or grab.
The staff are lovely, very helpful and the place is kept very tidy. They also have a gorgeous villa which would suit at least six people I highly recommend the OCEANNA ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è","Amazing place.
We stayed 3 nights in Oceanna and it was wonderful. Thanks to the staff for his kindness ans availability. Special mention to Nanda and Gede.

The room was incredible with a beautiful view to the sunset. It‚Äôs a very peace place to relax and enjoy your holidays.

We will recommend most of all this accommodation for your trip in Uluwatu !

See you soon üòÅ"

And food that we hadn't tried before in Bali, but worthy of a chef that I take the opportunity to acclaim.
The restaurant itself is located in the best spot of the resort with views over the sea and as such only adds value to the dinner... So 5 stars is the minimum you can give and a special thank you to the equally impeccable service of the staff, in fact , extended throughout the resort...
Staying here and not taking the opportunity to have dinner here would be a mistake....","The most romantic dining experience!

My partner and I recently had the pleasure of dining at La Cima Bali, and it was an enchanting experience from start to finish. From the moment we stepped foot into the restaurant, we were captivated by the romantic ambiance and breathtaking views.

Our server, Aris, provided us with impeccable service, attending to our every need with grace and charm. His recommendations were spot on, and his attention to detail made us feel truly cared for throughout the evening.

One of the highlights of our visit was the intimate atmosphere of the restaurant, which allowed us to enjoy each other's company in a secluded setting while savoring the delicious cuisine. The food was a culinary masterpiece, with each dish thoughtfully prepared and bursting with flavors that tantalized our taste buds.

Moreover, the panoramic view of Bali's stunning landscape from the restaurant's vantage point added an extra layer of romance to our dining experience. Watching the sunset while enjoying our meal was an unforgettable moment that we will cherish forever.","Just a lovely day hear at La Cima, I can‚Äôt recommend this place more!! Breathtaking view, amazing food (highly recommend the tuna tadaki) and super friendly staffs (hurray to Yande!!!). Thanks for making the most beautiful day in Bali",Great restaurant in the middle of the forest with spectacular views of the sea and sunsets! I stayed at the hotel and had dinner at La Cima every night. The food was always delicious and the staff super friendly! Can recommend the cocktails as well. Some of them were created by the employees themselves like the one handed by Bayu in the picture. Would love to come back soon!,"It was our firt time and Loved it! great view, delicious tapas and drinks. The staff are very hospitable, accomodating, service is amazing, specially Bayu who made us this off-menu special drink that I love so much."

The bedroom is super comfortable and the bathrooms is amazing. The private pool is excelent to watch the sunset or to spend some of the day chilling out. If I will return? Definitely yes!,"Absolutely stunning location with breathtaking views and meticulously maintained gardens. The space is incredibly clean, tidy, and well-organized, featuring excellent amenities, and the staff are exceptionally friendly. Sunsets by the private pool were a highlight of the experience. I had an incredible time and forged memories that will endure a lifetime.","Best place ever, if you are going to Bali it‚Äôs definitely the place to stay, best host, best location, best everything üôå","5 Stars is an understatement. Myself and my family stayed here and extended our stay twice because we just didn't want to leave. The view cannot be stated how special it is across the day and sunset. The breeze that the place gets due to its elevated location is just beautiful and refreshing. A fully equipped kitchen and spotless villa inside and out. The outdoor area seamlessly mixes into the living area which is perfect.

We slept incredibly well each night in this quiet setting surrounded by nature and in the most comfy bed. All the little things are done right here including the super soft linen.

I was a real pleasure to stay and we cannot wait to return and already planning our next trip. A treat to meet and get to know Gede and his lovely family.",I've been staying here for a long time. The villa is very cozy and has everything one may need. The view is just amazing! And Gede is a super friendly and nice host!
