But the view was so beautiful ❤️ too bad it was so cloudy when we reach the peak because We hike around 12 pm. The parking location was hard to find there's not much information about this hike on google, we almost hike in wrong path.","Best scenery on the whole island. Trekking with diverse landscapes views. The route from Terunyan village to  Abang takes about 4 hours in a quiet mode. The descent to Pos Pemandu Wisata Gunung Abang takes about 1.5 hours. The route is only 10 kilometers long. Walking along this route you will see Batur volcano, Agung, Rejani. Walk through picturesque green hills, magical rain forest, with tall trees and ferns. The route is of medium difficulty, I recommend you to use trekking shoes, otherwise it will be very slippery and not safe. The best time to start is 5:00 am. There is no need for a guide. The fee for the trail is not big - 25.000 rp. Highly recommended","Climbed Mount Abang yesterday.
Wasn't easy but well worth the effort.
Started at 4am and reached the summit about 10 minutes before sunrise.
About 2.5 hours hiking with a few breaks.
A guide is a good idea if going up in the early hours to see sunrise.
The trail has had some work recently to avoid washed-out sections.
It's slippery in places with small rocks and would be difficult if wet.
A hiking pole or a stick is very handy, especially on the way down.
The views are awesome across the lake to Mount Batur, which was covered in cloud for sunrise.
Wayan, my guide said Abang was covered in cloud the day before to so lucky to pick a good day.
Could see the peaks on Lombok and Java
The rainforest is amazing all the way up.
Photos don't do it justice. hard to get perspective of how steep it actually is.
The village below is about a mile straight down
There were only three of us on the summit.
Surprising with the hundreds of people that climb Mount Batur.
Take some warm clothes as it gets cold when you are up there a while.
Was a highlight of our visit to Bali.
A special place.",Great experience. No tourists at all. Ascent around 2h if you take little breaks and are in relatively good shape. The last push is a bit steep but doable when it's not raining. The views are spectacular. Descending is a bit more challenging but faster. Try to arrange a driver in advance if you do not have a scooter. There are local people who will stop you as ask you to pay 150k per person if you don't have a guide. Arguing is ineffective and they are not cooperative. But guide is not necessary as the trail is easy to follow.,"Nice and easy hike through lushy serene tropical forest with occasional view across the valley on the lake and m. Batur.
Beware of mean men which are collecting a compulsory “toll” to let you enter the trail. They have a brand new fake story about the closed trail and ongoing cleansing ceremony on the mountain with the only aim to get more money from you. At least make a bargain keeping in mind that official price for bule is as low as 20k per person"
