We made it to the summit via Pura Pasar Agung way, itâ€™s not easy so you'll need a good physical condition but it's doable.

Highly recommend to choose Darma as your guide if you plan to do this hike ðŸ™‚","I did the hike with Darma (local guide) a month ago to see the sunrise at Mont Agung. Departure at Pura Pasar (easier than Besakih Temple) at 00h for a long hike (more than 10h, breaks and stop at the top included).
Even though it is a hard hike Darma listened to our needs. He provides food for the hike (would advise to still bring extra with you), gives some information about the volcano and the most important he makes you laugh. We were 2 people doing the hike with Darma and I have to say that it was one of my most memorable memories of Bali. The hike is tough especially by nightime but you got so many memories after that, it's amazing.
It is really dangerous to go by yourself on this hike especially at nightime.
I recommend 100% Darma as a guide, he's great !!

(If you are not sure for Mont Agung I recommend you to try Mont Batur, ask for the difficult path first. I did mont batur 5 days before and it felt really easy, I could talk easily during the hike and I was eating most of the time while climbing. If you do not feel at ease at Mont Batur I do not recommend Mont Agung, or maybe just for the 2nd top of the mountain and not the 3142m top)","We booked the climb for six friends, and it was a unique experience. I highly recommend this guide. They are kind and funny and ensuring our safety. Having a guide is essential for the climb, and this one is exceptional.","Câ€™est parti mon kiki ! We can do it : nous pouvons le faire !
Thank you very much Darma from all our group ! Your happiness was so communicative : a great help to reach the top of the Agung.
Bonus : he is such a great singer ;)",Darma was a great guide good English and had alot of good stories about trekking Agung
