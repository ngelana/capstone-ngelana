Beautiful drive from Ubud to get to this organic plantation set in the serenity of rice paddies and fields. We went on the tour which was great and our guide Kadek was absolutely lovely. We loved learning about the plantation and the cacoa. Was really interesting to taste each stage of the bean as well.
Followed up with lunch. Chocolate iced drinks were amazing, lovely lumpia, but would suggest passing on the pizza. Not great. But the restaurant is beautifully set and lovely. One of the most interesting and genuine things we've done in Bali.","For chocolate lovers, this is a must visit place when you are in Tabanan. The menu is affordable, don‚Äôt forget their signature Raw Chocolate Ice Cream. The view is also stunning ‚Äî the rice field is so green. Moreover, they have a chocolate factory and workshop where you can buy the fresh cacao products directly from the shop. The service is also outstanding. Would love to visit again in the future.","The place is in the middle of rice fields. I came here for an educational trip. First, I thought they would show us the process of making chocolate from the cacao. But it turned out we just putting the chocolate in the mold and planting rice. They didn't even give us the knowledge about the chocolate itself.

The foods are also pricey and the taste wasn't really good.","Great place to visit with family. Tour includes welcome ice chocolate drink, cocoa tree plantation walk, molding chocolate, opening cocoa bean, row chocolate ice cream and chocolate souvenirs only for 450k. It took us  over 2,5 hours to complete  program. Definitely worth the price. 5 stars.","Would give 10 stars if I could! People are so kind and sweet in this place! The tour was very educational, took 1,5h, totally worth the money. They took us to see the trees, pick our own cacao, taste the raw fruit (which was surprisingly delicious). In the end we tasted all different sorts of chocolate they produce and bought a few to take home with us. They also had a beautiful cafe with cold chocolate and ice cream! Obrigada Kaydek, your first costumers from Brazil loved the experience!!! üáßüá∑üáÆüá©"

Lunch was Balinese and I had a great chicken noodle soup.
Part of the tour was a visit to a typical Bali house complex which consists of 4 houses with a house temple.
The house was on a hill and I climbed up and was given a scooter ride back down.
I actually made some chocolate pops and bought some great chocolate at extremely reasonable prices.  There are also rice paddies to visit.
My guide was wonderful and I highly recommend this tour.",Had an amazing tour here. Chose the ‚Äúchocolate experience‚Äù package and learned all about the bean to bar process. The tour guide was patient and knowledgeable - he answered all our questions. Delicious food in the restaurant and chocolate drinks and ice creams are also great. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre in Bali and are into chocolate!,"Amazing tour with Ida, she's lovely and took the time to take us around. It was a very lovely day","The place is nice, quiet and cool with a thick rural atmosphere. Besides seeing the cocoa garden, you can also see the activity of processing cocoa into various food commodities. Our advice is that you don't need to do the entire tour, unless you're really coming to study. Just get general information and try the variety of chocolate-processed foods.","Purchased this from a chocolate factory in Bali. Something very wrong with this chocolate. Inedible. Also bought the hot chocolate which is made with water. Really won't make it again, not nice at all."
