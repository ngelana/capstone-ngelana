Selemadeg, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=13171946278588091628,OPERATIONAL,,guest_house,"guest_house, hotel, lodging",4.9,9,,"I recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Bali away from the tourist crowds. Endra and his family welcome you in the heart of their village, a beautiful place between jungle and rice fields. A 100% local experience. You have the choice between a room with private bathroom (2 rooms are available) or a studio, a more graded space, which has a large bedroom and a private living room/kitchen. I chose the room because it is not only very comfortable, but also located in the family home, which makes the experience even more unique ! On site you have the choice between relaxing and meeting the locals, or visiting the area, which is very rich culturally. In short, don't hesitate to enjoy this magical village.","Secret Village Guest House offers everything you need when you are looking for an authentic holiday in Bali! Owners and staff go the extra mile for you and you feel like you're part of a family rather than just a guest in a guesthouse. Having a barbecue together and exploring the area reminded me again why I came to Bali. With stylish, minimalist appliances and polished concrete walls, the rooms are the perfect fusion of modernity and that Balinese flair I missed, which is hard to come by nowadays in Bali's other well-known, but overcrowded areas. Only three nights were as relaxing for me as a 2-week vacation!",This is a lovely spot to enjoy a sweet little village and the flowing rice fields while only a few minutes from the beach and great tide pools! A quiet sunrise or sunset walk is a must. The host family is kind and helpful and the rooms are beautifully decorated and thought out. Recommend it highly!,"Nice place to visit! The attention is so nice, I would like to come back.",Very calm and peacefull place. The people are very friendlyðŸ’•
