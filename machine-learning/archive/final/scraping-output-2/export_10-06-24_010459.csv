This market is divided into two main buildings, each serving a unique purpose and contributing to the overall charm of the area.

The first building is a treasure trove for art enthusiasts. It houses numerous art shops specializing in a wide array of crafts and artworks. Whether you're looking for traditional Balinese paintings, intricate carvings, handmade jewelry, or unique souvenirs, you'll find an impressive selection to choose from. The vendors are often artisans themselves, providing an authentic and personal shopping experience.

Adjacent to this artistic haven is the second building, which transforms into a bustling fresh market. Here, you can immerse yourself in the daily life of locals, exploring a variety of fresh produce, meats, and spices. Amidst the hustle and bustle, don't miss the opportunity to try a local street snack called lumpia. These delicious spring rolls are freshly prepared and generously drizzled with a sweet tangy peanut sauce, offering a delightful burst of flavors.

Pasar Kumbasari is also noted for its cleanliness, a commendable aspect for a market of its size and activity. Adding to the market's allure is its picturesque setting along a river, complete with benches where you can sit, relax, and soak in the surroundings. The serene river views provide a perfect contrast to the vibrant market atmosphere, making Pasar Kumbasari a must-visit destination for anyone exploring Denpasar.","I love this place. Too many handmade, crafts & paintings that are cute & nice. Definitely wanna go back again. I don't know the price, i hope not to be crazy expensive after the renovation. Been here before renovation. They have a lounge. It's connected to Badung Market. And the place for sitting under the building in front of Tukad Badung. Curious at night to see this place.","In Floor one, one mini dream catcher 5000IDR small 10000IDR, very cheap.
In Seminyak square, same pattern they sell 250000IDR, 90% discount in this art market","Typical local market. But take care for tourists they often ask high prices. Need to negotiate. When you buy food don't expect European hygienic situation. Also Wochen you buy dried fruit or products, is not always  consulted as some of them are only sold for tourists and out of age. In the basement after 3h30pm you can buy vegetable and fruit directly from delivering farmers. It is really impressive to have a look on the 'belly' of Denpasar. In the basement you have a large parking area but not all tourist may love the smell üòú. But I love to go there for shopping.","I came for a specific small souvenir art pieces that i previously saw being sold at a big temples and could not find anywhere else around Canggu. This market has a full floor dedicated to arts, with a big shop selling some really nice painting, so it was an easy find, with a nice prices. Of course, you can and should bargain here, but i was ok with prices even without negotiation, i think 3-4$ they ask for is fine for a more unique souvenir."

I have to say the food was okay, there's nothing special. The satay meat are small. White rice portion is small. The price are different story üòÖ
I had better than this place.","Do not expect fancy services or ambiance when you are eating here. Come here for flavorful, legendary pork satay that has been established for decades in Denpasar.

Tip, also order their beef soup that comes with light clear soup that really compliments the satay.","Sate Plecing Arjuna is a hidden gem that I recently had the pleasure of discovering. This small eatery specializes in pork satay, and it offers a unique twist with both sweet and chili sauce options. The taste of the pork satay was undeniably delightful, making it a must-try for satay enthusiasts.

One of the standout features of Sate Plecing Arjuna is the flavor of their pork satay, which is exceptionally good. The sweet sauce adds a delightful contrast to the smoky and tender pork, creating a harmonious blend of flavors. The chili sauce option is equally impressive, delivering a satisfying kick for those who enjoy a bit of heat.

The staff and owner were incredibly kind and welcoming, which added to the overall positive dining experience. Their warmth and attentiveness made me feel right at home, and it's always a pleasure to encounter such hospitality.

However, there are a couple of considerations to keep in mind. The popularity of this establishment means it's often crowded, which could result in a wait for a table. Additionally, finding parking space in the vicinity can be a challenge, so it's advisable to plan accordingly.

One potential drawback is that the prices for the dishes are not prominently displayed in the store. This lack of transparency can make it a bit tricky to gauge the cost of your meal upfront. It's a good idea to inquire about prices before ordering to avoid any surprises when the bill arrives.

In conclusion, Sate Plecing Arjuna is a must-visit for anyone craving delicious pork satay with a twist. The sweet and chili sauce options elevate the flavors, and the kind staff and owner enhance the dining experience. Just be prepared for potential crowds and parking challenges, and don't hesitate to ask about prices to ensure a seamless visit to this hidden gem.","I have tried their menus since 2004, surprisingly the quality of taste is still the same, even the venue also not much change. The owner lady still there hope she‚Äôs always healthy.

I can say their Sate Plecing is the best. One of my favourites!!! Every time i come to Bali, this is a must visit eat place. Also they open early like start from 7am even better. üòç

If you are a big eater 1 portion is never enough. The sate i can say quite small (I don‚Äôt mind because the taste is superb).

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates good food and great service.","One of the best in all of Bali. I was amazed by the quality of the food, the taste, and most of all the presentation. It was a surprise and me and my girlfriend fell in love with the food after the first bite.

We had the okonomiyaki which was without a doubt the best ive ever had. The egg was perfect, the truffle was amazing and the bread was the best bread i have ever had in asia.

The sushi was lovely and most of all looked beautiful.

The tuna apetizer was gorgeous with its different fish egg collours and edible flower decorations.

The chicken ramen was very tasteful especially considering that this isnt a ramen focused restaurant. Very tasteful broth!

The strawberry and passionfruit ice teas were lovely and tasteful.

I love conceptual cafe just like this. they present the Japanese atmosphere very well. I love every detail of the interior, it is very warm. the staff also helped us to choose the menu and explain it so we won't get confused with so many fancy coffees they serve.

Of course, we end up with something very basic. the cappuccino, long black (I forgot, I think they have the beans named), rum coffee. I can't recall the exact name of each beverage, but basically, that's what we ordered. the coffee is ok, but the one that I want to highlight is the coffee with rum to be on the list you should try. we also ordered an apple pie, we are obsessed!

we came for an afternoon coffee and did not expect a main dish to be served as well here. maybe on my next visitation, I might try their dish as well. their pricing I can say a bit expensive, but worth trying.

oh, and don't worry about the parking space if you come with a car. they provide the parking space app. 50 m from the cafe. it's free as well!"

Sutomo, Jl. Wahidin and Jl. Gajah Mada, nearby Babi Guling Grenceng.
Because it's next to the road, there is no parking lot, so you park on the side of the road, and ofc it's paid parking lot.
The place isn't too big. They do have a bit many of seats. A bit hot in the afternoon.
They only serve Tipat Tahu. The best option I'd like to recommend is TIPAT TAHU TELOR, which is a full plate of fried tofu, rice cake, and fried egg.
The price is ofc affordable. Look at the menu (photo) I attach. Start from 11.000 rupiah. It is one best options nearby Denpasar city for just having lunch.","Delicious local food, they give lot of peanut sauce, really fast services","This place serves good taste of Tipat Tahu‚ÄîIndonesian delicacy. The peanut sauce is rich and flavorful, served with shrimp cracker which you can ask for more! The portion wise is good and the price is reasonable, IDR 30k/2 pax. The place is spacious. Online payment, QRIS is available. Might a hard to park your car when it‚Äôs busy hours","Even though the taste has been declining (a lil bit) over the years, it still one of the best place to get authentic tipat tahu in denpasar. The place is good for single/couple dine in, if you have kids, better take out as it cramp and near high traffic street.","One of my fav indonesian food/snacks. Its rice cake with fried tofu, beansprouts, with peanut. And on the top of it fried eggs and crackers. Its cheap, also delicious comfort food. The place  always packed with customers, hard to find seating in lunch time.

Freshly cooked, I didn't have to wait too long for the food which was great. Had to wait a bit for it to cool down though! Good service in this quaint, friendly restaurant. Worth popping in for a meal.

Clean and good atmosphere.","The taste miesoa is good 4,2 / 5
And Dory claypot is flat,  if using chili is more delicious & tasty : 4,4 / 5","Ordered Mie kriuk siram sapi with cireng on a hot claypot (a bit salty, cireng is awesome), Gohyong (it tastes great), Nasi hainan chicken (nice for kids). Also ordered es cincau hitam (love it)","The signature misoa is fun-tastic, it's a must try. However, Hainan Rice is quite let down as the taste of the rice out-tasted by the Claypot.

Reminded me back home cause most of the menu I would have it almost every day when I was on my childhood. üòä

We ordered the Mie Yamin (Asin), Es teler, Cendol, and the platers of snack (siomay, batagor, bakso goreng).

1. Mie Yamin, for me, is a bit salty. I know I chose ""Asin,"" but I'm not sure it's supposed to be that salty.
2. Es cendol is quite disappointing (sorry), the jackfruit is not really ripe, and some are spoiled. The cendol is very hard and felt like it's been a couple of days in the fridge.
3. Siomay was a bit mushy, I think it was steamed for quite some time. The batagor was so so, but I liked the bakso goreng and not sure about the peanut sauce cause when it arrived. To me, it's like a peanut paste, very thick.
4. Es teler was a bit too sweet for me and very milky.

I am sure they can improve and will be  back definitely if they do.","ü§© -> how i look when they served my ice cendol. You see those jackfruit topping? ü§§
Food is so Bandung, simple.
Sure a nice intermezzo after all those heavy meal.
Personal note: more enjoyable late afternoon or early evening. Dun come here in starve mode, only 2 servers working all day. Spread smile to make other's life easier.","The first time I came here, make sure did not contain pork, and the menu was also safe. It also tastes good, just right. I ordered the whipped noodles (mie kocok), and the filling was so much that the bowl was full. The marble cake tastes almost like spik*oe. The place is also cute and cozy. Worth to try","Perfect for lunch in the middle of a hot day in Denpasar.

Their Mie Ayam Jamur and Es Alpukat were beyond perfection! What an awesome combo ü§§üôèüèº","When the first time I was about to try this, I thought it gonna be an ordinary taste noodles like most bakmi. I was wrong, the taste was quite unique and it served hot with special broth. Their siomay with peanut sauce also worth to try, definitely gonna comeback again and try their other menu."
