Panties pizza is also available, the soft and cheesy pizza. Clean, friendly staff, indoor & outdoor seating, crowded and limited parking during meals time.","Their Nashville chicken are so good! Great spiciness and crispy. If only they open it near seminyak area I will sure eat more often. They not only sells chicken but also a joint food chain with panties pizza. Overall the taste was good, affordable price and you know what, it can make you to crave more.","The chicken was really great, i just didn't expect the spinach and the scrambled egg is this small. Overall the food is great and the place is clean enough. Will come again.","Spicy food lovers rejoice! Not only is Hotway's a good representation of ""Nashville Hot Chicken"", but their spice levels can and will defeat even the toughest tongues. I HIGHLY recommend trying a calibration piece at level 3, called ""fast"" before you go for the level 4. And only those who can handle the MOST intense spice should go for level 5.

This is coming from someone who always orders the hottest thing on the menu and usually doesn't struggle with the spice level, even here in Asia. But this level 5 is a serious challenge. So don't go there unless you really want the ordeal.

But assuming you get the right spice level for you, the flavors themselves are delicious. Well worth a trip from wherever you are staying in South Bali.","have ordered from them twice. chicken is always good, but they've forgot to pack the rice which i should be getting in my order twice now. hopefully something is done about this because come on, people pay to get food, and not getting the food they paid for is not cool."

went here again on 2021 and the place was barely living. no customers, dimmed light... quiet....

the taste still the same like years ago. price was cheap. taste wise it was okay, no wow factor but definitely a good lunch

liking the garlic one and kebab. they had more flavor than the others","For me the pizza is way too sweet. Only eat 2 slices from 2 menu i ordered. Its a new hype in town so its crowded, food came after 30-40minutes from order. Its cheap tho, only 27-33k per menu. Lack of car parking, so better use motobike.
