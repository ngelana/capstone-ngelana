They are really helpful and cater to your needs. Here we get Villas not rooms for our stay(I took a 1 room version), we got a room with attached toilet with bathtub(big enough to fit 2 people in it) , there is a kitchen outside with utensils(also if you need anything they will bring it to you within 10mins), there is also an outdoor shower, and the best part is the pool. Amazing clean pool with a decent depth(i am 174cm and the water is up to my neck). You can jump into the pool i mean. Do try their floating breakfast it's fun. Also they can provide you with a beautiful romantic dinner (please inform them a day before). They also have a spa where you can get massages and all. It's amazing spot for honeymooners. Loved every moment of the stay.","Ubud Raya Villas provide a serene sanctuary amidst the jungle, though the presence of insects and lizards might deter some. The highlight of the stay is undeniably the spacious private pool, perfect for unwinding amidst nature's embrace. What truly sets this villa apart is the exceptional service provided by the staff members, who consistently go the extra mile to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable stay.

While the restaurant offerings may not be exceptional, the complimentary breads and fruits offered upon checkout are a thoughtful gesture that adds to the overall experience. The welcome massage, albeit short, offers a rejuvenating start to the stay.

One drawback is the villa's distance from the main town, requiring additional travel time for those looking to explore beyond the jungle surroundings. However, the lush green ambiance of the Manipura room creates a deep connection with nature, making it an ideal choice for nature enthusiasts seeking tranquility.

In conclusion, despite its remote location, Ubud Raya Villas offers a memorable retreat for those seeking solace amidst Bali's natural beauty, complemented by exceptional service and a refreshing private pool experience.","Very good hospitality and huge resort, it's great and calm, the arrangements and the rooms are very nice, it's kind of honeymoon treat to newly wed couples.

Resort is grand.
Swimming pool is clean and calming, the bath tub arrangement is good.","A two bedroom villa doesn't have a bathtub in another bedroom. We lived in Yudhishthir villa where too much Lizards ü¶é was present. Whole night we took Frog üê∏ sound. Also There is Mouse roaming in washroom üêÄ.
Indian food was not there.
The kitchen is available but, they don't have Utensils to cook something. No use of the kitchen.","The villa was spacious with all the facilities for a comfortable stay. The service was great too but the limited choice for breakfast is underwhelming. They provide only 1 veg or 1 non-veg dish for breakfast along with a fruit drink. The location of the resort is far from the city too. So, wandering out of the resort for light shopping is fruitless. The staff is welcoming and we'll mannered and takes care of you in every aspect."

We stayed here for 3 nights and we had booked 4 villa rooms. The service and staff were excellent. The villa rooms were superb for a stay and all the rooms had a private swimming pool which was also extremely clean. Room and the pool were cleaned daily. Their is an outdoor kitchenette with each villa which is enough to cook in case one prefers with gas and cutlery provided.

Breakfast is not like a spread but guests had to choose from 8-9 options that they provide. Its enough for a person and tasty too.

We also tried their ""floating breakfast"" service, a first for us and a very nice experience.

Highly recommend this place for a family stay.","For us it was bad experience, room had lot of insects. The room service phone was not working so for every small thing we had to walk to reception even at odd times, they kept on telling we will get it repaired buy no one came. Breakfast was pathetic. They didn't even deliver what they committed to us they said, we forgot!! Unprofessional and untrained staff. Would never visit again.
No one even came for room cleaning. Shower is not proper, hot water facility is poor, there is bath tub but without hot water and slow water flow it is of no use. Restaurant is also not there.","It‚Äôs a worst place to stay for anyone. The room had lot of insects and mosquitoes and we complained they changed the room to a more worse one. The rooms didn‚Äôt have a faucet as well and the furniture is so old. Recommended not to stay in this hotel and the staff is very unprofessional and don‚Äôt understand basic English.

Recommendation: 0/5","Beautiful, Spacious & calm Villa available at UBUD!!
Must book for spending some Quality time
As it offers open kitchen followed by spacious Pool for couple & lastly the room Size & Service offered by caretaker!!
Birds chuckling in morning, felt pleasant.

Friendly environment maintained by caretaker!!
Must book this place..","Warning! Stay Away from The Kampung Ubud Villa ‚Äì A Disappointing Experience

Our stay at The Kampung Ubud Villa was a total letdown. The pictures they showed online were totally different from what we got. The room we got was small and not at all like what we booked.

When we complained, the hotel staff didn‚Äôt listen and refused to give us our money back. It felt like they were cheating us.

If you‚Äôre thinking of staying at The Kampung Ubud Villa, think again. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake we did. Look for another place to stay where they treat you right. This hotel isn‚Äôt worth your time or money. Avoid it if you can."

They don't take accountability for their long service (which took 90 minutes to get my meal) and I specifically asked for no green onions and my meals had green onions. Blaming having no drivers is false. My order started at 12:45pm. My first grab driver cancelled because the order was not prepared. As my second driver arrived, my order was still no prepared he had to wait 40 minutes. After an hour, I asked my driver to ask the kitchen how much longer it will be, he said another 15 minutes. In total it took 90 minutes which I would have order from another restaurant.","Well worth the visit. I had the miso soup but could not taste the miso. Then I had the smoked chicken soup, small but nice. The pork buns were delicious. Quiet place. I just wish there was no smoking. Noodles are fresh homemade.","This restaurant offers amazing ramen and asian style sandwiches. The service is great, as well as the place itself - it has nice rice field view","Very lovely experience. I never do reviews,  however I feel the need to commend this restaurant on their hospitality and impeccable food.

Great host and mindfully done craftsmanship in every inch of the property. Stay there to enjoy the warmth, hospitality, and tranquility.",I absolutely enjoyed my stay here at Villa Sindu! Everything was amazing from the delicious breakfast made every morning by Mary. To the attentive service of Dewa to all my needs. The grounds were kept beautifully and I really enjoyed laying on the hammock and hearing the nature. I also enjoyed sitting by the koi pond and watching the fish. My bed was very comfortable and the strong fan and air conditioner kept me cool at night. As a solo female traveler feeling safe was very important and I absolutely did. The center of Ubud is a short distance. When I come back to Bali I will definitely be staying here again. I absolutely recommend staying here if you‚Äôre traveling to Ubud!,"Everything about Villa Sindu was exceptional, a slice of paradise, away from the tourist hotspots and all to ourselves.  Dewa (host)and staff made our stay feel like a home away from home, everything from our daily breakfasts, massages (every 2 days),  rides into Ubud central and the fantastic, fun, informative private tourist trip driver( Waylenüòä)was organised making this our first holiday to Bali memorable, remarkable and already dreaming of our return visit to the Villa and the lovely people we met there.
Highly recommended 10/10","This villa is so beautifully appointed by Dewa, we felt like we were walking into a secret garden. It is very private. There are three individual cottages each with their own gorgeous outdoor bathroom. Breakfast is lovely. You will need a driver to get to downtown Ubud."

I ordered a banana milkshake but banana juice came, I asked for a change like the order I requested but I couldn't because the bananas had run out. and I asked for banana juice that had been made but the employee said it had been thrown away?!
Finally I ordered a chocolate milkshake, when the female employee brought me the drink, her face looked like she was annoyed. She just put the drink on the table and didn't say anything, until my husband said thank you but the employee didn't respond anything .
I ordered fetuchini carbonara but came was spaghetti carbonara, here I didn't ask for anything because I was already lazy with the grumpy look on the employee's face. I really want to get out of this cafe quickly.
