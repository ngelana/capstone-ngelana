Photo 1 in review by MUAAZ MAHBOOB","The Flea Market in Seminyak, despite its size, offers a charming shopping experience with a notable feature‚Äîan expansive warung within its confines. While the market boasts a unique selection of items, the prices can be on the higher side, requiring some negotiation skills to secure a better deal. The presence of a sizable warung adds to the appeal, providing a convenient break for refreshments amid your shopping endeavors. If you're willing to haggle for a fair price, this small market with its culinary option can still offer a pleasant and distinctive shopping outing in Seminyak.","**Flea Markets: A Treasure Hunter's Delight (With a Side of Caution)**

Flea markets are a unique shopping experience that can be exciting, rewarding, and sometimes a little overwhelming! They offer a chance to delve into the past and uncover unexpected treasures. Here's a breakdown of what to expect:

**The Pros**

* **Unique Finds:** Flea markets are overflowing with vintage clothing, antiques, collectibles, quirky household items, and unexpected gems you won't find in stores.
* **Bargain Potential:** Haggling is part of the experience, and you can often score amazing deals on one-of-a-kind pieces.
* **Sense of Discovery:** The thrill of the hunt is real! You never know what you might stumble upon, making flea markets an adventure.
* **Supporting the Community:** You'll often be buying from individuals and small businesses, supporting the local community.
* **Sustainability:**  Flea market shopping gives used items a new life, promoting a more sustainable approach to consumerism.

**The Cons**

* **Quality Can Vary:** Not everything is a hidden gem ‚Äì be prepared to sift through some duds to find the good stuff.
* **Condition Isn't Always Perfect:**  Items may be dusty, worn, or have minor flaws. Inspect things carefully before buying.
* **Crowds and Chaos:** Flea markets can be hectic, especially on weekends. Prepare for some jostling and noise.
* **Cash is King:** Many vendors may not accept cards, so bring cash.
* **Knowing Your Worth:** Some research on pricing will help you avoid overpaying and make better bargaining decisions.

**Overall Opinion**

Flea markets are a fantastic option if you love a treasure hunt, value unique items, and enjoy a bit of hustle and bustle. With patience and a discerning eye, you can unearth incredible finds and walk away with some seriously cool stuff.

**Tips**

* **Go Early:** The best finds go fast, so arrive early in the morning for the widest selection.
* **Dress Comfortably:** Wear comfy shoes and layers for changing temperatures.
* **Bring a Tote:** A reusable bag is essential for carrying your purchases.
* **Be Open-minded:** Flea markets are best approached with a sense of adventure, not a specific shopping list. You might be surprised by what catches your eye.

**Is a flea market right for you?  If you are a fan of bargaining, enjoy unique items, and love the thrill of the hunt, then absolutely!**"

However, customers could smoke here, so we asked to get reseated inside.
Very busy and popular foreigners place.
Coffee was okay. The food was nice. Portions big enough for me but quite small for my brother. Ordered second for him.
Staff were friendly. Had to wait a bit for food during peak hours, but quick after that.","A little bit of everything. Breakfast, lunch, coffee, bar, etc. Good extensive menu in an alleyway hidden location. We ordered the chicken burger and the Mexican bowl. Both were good. One of the waiters was very nice but throughout the meal none stopped by to ask if we needed something. Coffee was also good but their menu consists of single espresso shots for all drinks. Even though they only have one size for their basic espresso drink line, they should differentiate single and double shots based on type of drink (flat white vs latte vs iced etc) . Once you request the entire double shot, they charge it so the drink becomes expensive. The cookie was amazing. Probably one of the best we‚Äôve tried in Bali. The waiter was nice enough to heat it up a bit.","Revolver in Seminyak isn't your average cafe. It's a full-blown experience for your taste buds and soul. Let's start with the coffee - honestly, the best I've ever had. Rich, flavorful, and consistently amazing every single visit. They must have a secret because it puts most Australian cafes to shame.

But Revolver is more than just a caffeine haven. Their food is fantastic, with a delicious spread that caters to all kinds of eaters. From healthy options to comfort food, you won't be disappointed.

And if you're looking for a nightcap, their cocktails are just as good. Happy hour is a regular event with very reasonable prices, making it the perfect spot to unwind after a day of exploring Bali.

The vibe at Revolver is vibrant and fun. Electronic tunes set the mood, creating a cool atmosphere. But the real stars of the show are the staff. Friendly and attentive, they go above and beyond to ensure you have a top-notch experience.

Having been to Bali three times now, Revolver has become a must-visit for me. It's the ultimate cafe, hands down. Highly recommended!","Super popular cafe which exceeded expectations! Best lattes in Seminyak come from here.

The truffle mash was a wonder. Packed lots of flavour. Avocado sour dough was great too. The prawn toast was tasty, but personally it was too oily for me as it was conventionally deep fried.

Lattes and milkshakes are bomb!! So much so I had to buy their coffee beans home (they grind them for you if you ask!). They retailed at 130k per 250g bag. Don't forget to get your loyalty stamp cards for every 9 drinks ordered you get 1 free.","Revolver Seminyak is a culinary oasis tucked away in an alley, offering a tantalizing menu and vibrant atmosphere. We went for dinner but the breakfast menu looks just as good. The hot chicken burger and rigatoni Alla vodka satisfied our taste buds, while the dragon fruit margarita during happy hour added a refreshing twist. Exceptional service and stylish decor complete the experience, making it a must-visit destination."

Overall, it was a good place for brunch and gathering in the area.",Great experience. The food was very delicious but we felt the portions were a bit small. The staff were very friendly especially Mega. Definitely will come again and highly recommended.,"The perfect place for brekkie.

The service crew is brilliant! Polite and service focused. Made us feel welcomed and appreciated. Aguz was our server and he did a splendid job on checking-in and making sure we had everything we needed. AMAZING!!!

The food curation on the menu makes the Aussie culture come alive. Thanks for this atmosphere and experience.

A must try when in Bali!!!","We had coffees here on 2 occasions and they were great. The breakfast was good, but the sourdough just gets so chewy for me, I'd like to have the option to just order normal bread. But the taste was good.

Overall nice cafe to have a meal and just chill. Gets crowded for sure","This place serves pretty decent cafe food and for some reason, it is super popular with tourists, especially caucasians! When we entered, almost 90% of the guests there were caucasians.

Food wise, nothing much that stands out except the pulled pork charcoal roll.

For their smoothies, they are quite famed for their pash me and power dragon, and they tasted pretty decent. But then again, you are in Bali and almost every other place serves smoothie so yeah.

Oh one good point is that they will always ask if you have any allergies to any kind of food - thought that was pretty nice."

Well designed. The ham and Gruy√®re croissant was delicious, salty and flaky! The coffee was excellent and a nice oasis from the heat! Give it a go for a drop in visit for a pick me up! Worth it","Bright & clean place, chill vibes. Would recommend the Best Scramble; it had a soft and runny texture, tasted buttery, and was simply the creamiest, most delicious scrambled eggs I've ever had. They have options for add-ons, but I think it's best enjoyed as is. I opted to add smoked salmon and katsuoboshi, but they ended up being too much (as in, the dish became too heavy, and the katsuoboshi was quite literally way too much as they gave a whole cereal bowl's worth of it).

The pistachio cube is softer than I expected; it resembles bread more than a laminated pastry. The custard inside was runny and had a subtle pistachio taste.

The matcha latte was quite strong and originally doesn't come with any sugar. If you want it to be sweet their only option is to add vanilla syrup, which distracts from the matcha taste so I wouldn't recommend it.","Well, I was soooooo disappointed with their recent food quality. I was a regular back then at their first branch in Canggu esp in 2021. I was a huuuuge fan of their Ricotta Hotcake. The strawberry one you see is the Ricotta Hotcake I know from my visits in 2021. Very rich, delicious and, portion wise, generous. But when I came back again, this time at their branch in Seminyak Village, I was so surprised their Ricotta Hotcake looked so different (the blueberry one). And it was a hot mess. Not hot enough, def not tasty and super expensive. I mean I can make it by myself if it looks like this. I understand if there‚Äôs some menu adjustment or changing, but you are joking if you are charging this amount of of money for this kinda bland food? Not even the plating was good. And we didn‚Äôt even finish the food and it‚Äôs rarely to me to not finish my food no matter how bad the food is. So you can guess.

And the scrambled egg? Their pinnacle menu? A huge downfall and def a huge letdown. I knew it was not freshly made because it was barely warm even my friend asked me, ‚Äúis it not freshly made? Because it‚Äôs not hot and even the bowl is not warm‚Äù. Adding to that, it‚Äôs too watery. And they charged more for this menu. I was so excited to bring along my friend with me because she‚Äôs never been to Baked before and I was kinda overselling it, ‚Äúoh you should try it, they‚Äôre the best, esp the scrambled egg‚Äù and after we tasted the egg, I felt embarrassed and even apologized to her.

The coffee was decent. Definitely, they lose their once-a-regular-customer. I definitely will not come back here. Super disappointed.","Nice friendly staff. Got a flat white and two free waters, as they don‚Äôt sell water. Coffee was tasty as like most coffee shops in Bali."

The biggest concern and the reason why I rate this star below par is that , there was mold all over the tiles grout on the shower. Not just a little, a whole lot. It was caused by the lack of cleaning. I took a tissue and it rubbed off. Since they didn't do a good job maintaining the tiles, some of the mold was deep in and has to be replaced. The pics are after 3 days of me complaining and they cleaned it the best they can.

Lastly there was mold all over the curtain, this was more understandable since it's so humid it can cause this. But at the same time, they should be either washing the curtains or change it to something that doesn't attract mold.","What a wonderful place to start our first ever trip to Bali.

I was given an upgrade. The staff was very polite and amazing. They gave me details about the places that I can visit during my time there.

For someone who is a strict vegetarian you will have to look somewhere else to for lunch/dinner, as mostly food here was non veg.

We ordered the seafood BBQ platter, pork ribs, lamb shanks and I got the ""Greatest cocktail"" to drink

While the food all looked fabulous and were big plates, we felt the food while good  wasn't great. My hardcore meat eating pals, thought the lamb and pork was a little on the tough side. The fries were ultra awesome though.

The seafood platter looked fab, they ran out of prawns unfortunately and we got them substituted with scallops. The garlic bread was actually the best bit! I wish instead of putting the same sauce over all the items, they could have served a selection of sauces as dipping options. The oysters were on the mini side, but the squids were large and fresh. I think this would make a very good starter.

My drink was refreshing, but ""greatest"" is a bit of a hyperbole.

They do have a massive menu, so maybe it's best to stick to their classic pizzas and pasta, which is what they seem popular for.","Enjoyed this cafe! One of the best coffees I‚Äôve had. I went back for second orders for Flatwhites. Balanced coffees.

The menu is amazing with loads to choose from and the portions are large. Well worth the time and cash.

Ambience:
Chilled. Relaxed. Welcoming.

Service:
Excellent. Polite. Warm. Service oriented. Caring.

Menu:
To die for!","So good! Everything was so good!

We ordered crab croquettes, chicken parma and seafood platter.

The seafood platter was so good! The sauce they used was a mixture of sweet sour and spicy, making it not so heavy which was so lovely! The atmosphere was also great, even though it was packed!","Great service, great food, has a nice ambience. We tried the steak, garlic pizza, and tea. A little critique for the steak because it lacks the sauce but you can ask for more and we asked for medium well but the meat was kind of raw. The garlic pizza was great, has a nice garlicky taste with thin pizza dough but it‚Äôs pretty small, can probably only feed 2-3 people for one pizza. The price of the foods are pretty standard for restaurant price tend a bit cheap but the drinks are pretty expensive. The place is very comfortable, good for hanging out.","The live band was amazing. I love it. ü•∞ You can also order songs. The atmosphere was really great! We ordered a seafood platter and a pork rib. Pork rib was great. As for the seafood platter, I think the sauce was too much and too strong as I can‚Äôt really taste the seafood. I think the fish was delicious. The other seafood were okay. French fries was way overcooked. Thankfully the waitress helped us replace another plate. Good service!"

The atmosphere was pleasant, with an open ceiling that allowed us to dine under the stars, giving it a chic, upscale vibe. Our starter, the compresse salad, was excellent, and the cocktails were enjoyable.

However, things took a turn for the worse from there. The pizza we ordered had uncooked sausage, and the salami was extremely salty, so we could only manage two slices. Additionally, the waiter forgot the second cocktail I ordered. When it was time to pay, it took over 20 minutes to get our bill, and there was no apology for the delay. Personally, I would avoid this restaurant; we had better and more affordable dining experiences elsewhere in Bali.","interesting open air decor with hells kitchen kitchen style view into an active kitchen.  unfortunately the food doesn‚Äôt taste as good as it looks and doesn‚Äôt live up to the high price, quite disappointed as the food standard has dropped.

Located right in the heart of Seminyak, this area is packed and the Goat seems to be one of the best places around for good food, watching sport and live music.

The night I visited there was a great live band playing who encouraged any of the customers to join in with the band. This saw singers, drummers and guitarists all take it in turn to join the band and each time the band blended them in perfectly and it really got the crowd going.

With two floors and a small outside terrace that spans across the full building frontage, you can choose the type of atmosphere and interaction you want.

I started off with garlic bread which was perfectly cooked. However, when I moved to the chicken burger and chips, the chicken really didn't taste great, whilst the chips did.

Even with the food not being great, the overall experience makes me give it 5 stars.","Outstanding service welcomes all guests warmly, regardless of nationality.

Not only did the food offer fantastic value, but it also tantalized our taste buds with every bite. The chicken satay, bursting with flavor, and the aromatic Nasi Goreng seafood were standouts.

However, it was the pork ribs that stole the show. Soft and succulent, they practically fell off the bone, delivering a symphony of flavors with each mouthwatering bite. The smoky chicken and chicken curry spring roll added a delightful twist to our meal, further enhancing the dining experience.

1. I booked a hotel transfer and informed the hotel of my flight details. The flight was delayed by about 25 minutes, and after collecting my luggage, I exited the airport immediately. I walked around two to three times but couldn't find the driver. I even requested two airport announcements but still couldn't the driver. Finally, at 12:45 AM, I had to find another driver, which cost me almost double price to get to the hotel.

2. I arrived at the hotel around 1:30 AM on May 31st and went to sleep around 2-3 AM. In the morning, while I was using the bathroom, staff knocked on the door once or twice (I thought it was from another room ). After using the bathroom, I found the staff knocking and entering my room at 9:48 AM to clean the room. 9:48 AM??? Isn't that too early?

After the manager know about the situation, He provided a hr spa and breakfast as compensation. I thanked him.

But, at night
3. Since I was going to Ubud on June 1st to learn yoga, I had separated $1,700( I‚Äôm pretty sure I count the money before leave the room) for tuition into a small bag and placed it in my luggage . I also had $500 for living expenses in my wallet. When I returned to the room around 9 PM, I found $200 missing from my small bag. I requested to check the surveillance footage, but the hotel said there were no cameras and they couldn't help. The police station is about a 30-minute taxi ride away, and I would need to pay the police for the documents.

What can I say after all this? And I travel by my own, I can only consider myself unlucky. God will punish the person who stole the money.

The room had no locker or internal lock door, and there were no cameras to provide any bad things happen. I deeply regret choosing this hotel for my stay.","5 stars for all package: spent 5 nights in this boutique resort on a private pool villa.

The main shopping street was in very easy walking distance.

The beach was a bit more of a hike, and if we‚Äôd have been staying longer we‚Äôd probably have given one of the Grab motorbikes a go, but we were travelling with two young children.

The only thing to be aware of if you‚Äôre travelling with children is that the pool is not fenced off.  The rooms are not connected by an internal door, so you need to walk around the pool to get from one room to the other.

This wasn‚Äôt a problem for our children (4 and 9) as both are good swimmers and sensible around water.  We did alter our sleeping arrangements so the 4 year old was with a parent overnight however - just in case."
