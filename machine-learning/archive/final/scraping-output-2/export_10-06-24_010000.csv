Nice atmosphere, pool, good food and relaxing music.
We celebrated my friend‚Äôs Bday there and it was amazing.
I think we tried almost everything in the menu, but their specialty is coffee. Avocadocino is the bestü§ç
Ibu was so nice to be opened only for us.

Highly recommend!

Please, remember to bring the towel with you, if you want to swim in the pool.",Nice hide out in the middle of busy Denpasar. Good coffee good snack and comfortable to work. Superb architecture.,So nice,This place so comfy and great for chillaxing. The staff is so kind and friendly üëç,"The best place, where you can eat tasty and real food :)"

The ambiance is truly delightful, with an open swimming pool adding to its charm. Additionally, the resort features a spa for relaxation. The atmosphere is peaceful and serene, free from any city noises. The staff was exceptionally helpful and even arranged for us to rent bikes to explore the surrounding area.

There is an art museum on the premises. The breakfast served was delicious and freshly prepared.This resort closely resembled an authentic Balinese lifestyle and architectural design.We were delighted to capture every aspect of the resort due to its genuine authenticity.

I strongly suggest this place for those seeking a tranquil and serene vacation experience that will rejuvenate your mind and create lasting memories.","Nice polite staff and very helpful.
I enjoyed my 7 day stay there. The room was comfortable (with a private pool). My only issues were their food, very limited choices and not that good. And the private pool wasn't that private, there is a balcony right above us. And the door to my pool was an old heavy wooden door that I had to lift to open/close.
These things didn't affect my stay in a major way but I thought they are worth mentioning.","Amazing views, very friendly service, beautiful and cozy rooms.  Prices are great and the food is excellent. The pool and spa are both wonderful. My girlfriend and I had an excellent time the two and a half days we stayed here. There was a woman in reception named ""Evi"" who speaks English very well who was extremely helpful she. It came to answering some questions that we had and was more than happy to accommodate is with any needs that we had.",Had a lovely stay here! The staff was extraordinarily friendly and we felt welcome from the moment we arrived. Breakfast was delicious with fresh fruit and various options to choose from. We also had dinner here several evenings and can also recommend it. Would love to come back into this Balinese oasis anytime!,"Totally worth a 5 star rating. I had booked a private pool villa and boy it was pure luxury.
The place is full of lush green trees and is located on the outskirts of Ubud on the main road. It's easy to miss to this place because there's no grand entrance but let it not fool you, it is beautiful inside. You're welcomed with a refreshing welcome drink and the staff will escort you to the room. There is a beautiful carved Ganesha idol at the entrance. The private pool villa is a luxury at another level. The staff was more than happy to do a beautiful decor for honeymoon upon request. Room service is available and the menu offers delicious local and continental food. The menu is not very long but the food is deliciously prepared with high quality ingredients and meat. There is a common pool too. This place has a very quirky library and an art museum which is free for the guests. Safe and secure parking is available for cars and bikes. The private pool will give you a Jacuzzi feeling as the motors pump the water. Oh, I loved them so much. The rooms have huge bathtubs which can accommodate two for romantic bath sessions. There is a phone in the room and you can make local and international calls which are chargeable. They have a Spa which offers professional full body massage (not the hanky panky stuff). Remember, Bali is just 8 degrees South of equator and it is warm and humid. There are trees around and you're actually in the habitat of many insects and crawlies. Geckos are common and you can hear them around. I somehow like the sound of the nature around me, so I was totally cool with it. The location, ambience, library, private pool, art museum and the facilities considered, it is totally worth 5 star rating."

It was a fantastic way to see the sights of Bali.,You cannot go wrong with Bali Nature Holiday!! They are the most amazing tour guides I have ever had! They helped me set up everything from airport transfers to excursions around the entire island!! I would HIGHLY recommend them!! I will for sure be using them again when i go back to the island!,"Putu was the absolute best person to help plan Bali excursions! We prebooked the full day temple tour - do not miss this one! Then Putu arranged some additional custom excursions for us with his wonderful team, Ketut and Gede. Ketut was the most knowledgeable, friendly tour guide we had our entire trip. Can not recommend this crew enough. Book them for everything Ubud and beyond!",Putu had organized a great tour of Bali during our stay in December and we had a very nice time there. The driving was very safe and punctal. If you need to adjust the timings and stops you have to let him know and he will incorporate it into the plan.
