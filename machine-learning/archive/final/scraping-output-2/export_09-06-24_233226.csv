That was interesting. After that they asked if we want to try something and we had a really tasty lunch with vegetarian food. It's real they had three animals in 2x2x2 meters ‚Äãboxes, but they told us they change the animals often so they can come back to wilderness. Not sure if it's real but they looked in good condition.
Anyway nice experience.","One of the many breathtaking/fantastic views you'll see in Bali here.  However, to see the animals being put in small cages is just awful.  This is clearly a tourist spot where they expect you to purchase their ""priced"" products after sampling the teas & coffees.  Having been in Ubud for a while, these teas and coffees here are no better than what's available in local shops/cafes, but with tourist prices!",Nice coffee with nice view üçÉ,,
