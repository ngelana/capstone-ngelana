So respectful and kind. Big shout out to Agus, he made great conversation with us and was very friendly and helpful.

This place had the best breakfast buffet we’ve had in Bali over the years, an amazing roof top pool with amazing sunsets, views and drinks. It wasn’t too far of a drive to the main area of Canggu. The store across the road was great for cold drinks and snacks, there’s a massage parlour across the road and ATM around the corner. Laundry services were amazing, clothes washed within less than 24hours. Rooms had Netflix which we’ve found to be uncommon in Bali.

Any bad reviews that we have seen, seem like those folk don’t understand they’re paying cheap prices in a newly industrialised country. These people are kind and doing their best, we loved it and we’d come again.","Don't be fooled by the pictures. This place is very cheap. Crappy, old moldy pillows. The walls are thin as paper and the hallways echo all night with the sound of drunk backpackers coming home late and slamming their doors. And if that doesn't keep you awake, the road noise of passing cars and motorbikes will ensure you are thoroughly exhausted and sleep deprived from your stay here.

The breakfast staff was very nice and accommodating. The front desk staff was also nice. The ""sales team"" was a disorganized mess and gave the room we booked away to someone else when we came in to check in and present a deposit.

The room isn't well ventilated so I found myself allergic to construction dust and unable to breathe at night.",Rooms are not big but the quality  of service is Top notch. Very kind staff. They have a 24 hours kitchen which means you can come back to your room after a party and order pizza or fried rice,"Didn’t have such a great stay here, the rooms weren’t so clean. We had a dirty laundry bag full of hairs in the closet. There was only hot water in the morning. Sheets and towels were stained","If i can leave a 0 star, I would totally do that.

When i first checked in, they gave me a ground floor room when I already requested for a high floor room during the booking. worst thing is, it is just next to the male public toilet of the hotel.

When I enter the room, it is totally different from what I booked.
The room is dim and looks dirty, i take pictures and you can see them yourself. When i enter the room, the aircon is not working and is super hot, room is damp and smell like mouldy room.

Thirdly, there is no extra power point for your laptop charging at all. you need to move the tv so you can use the powerpoint of the TV. To make things worse, there is power leakage on the powerpoint and it electrocutes me.

Room doesnt come cheap at all for this hotel and I dont deserve this kind of treatment.
My holiday mood is ruined by this hotel stay experience."

My two little girls love it there, especially the restaurant staff. They are so welcoming and always take time to play and greet my little daughters. Lastly can I just say the food is also amazing but that WAHADI makes lovely coffees 🤩🤩!! My flat white, oat coffee never tasted so good - just what I usually need to lift my day.","I recently visited Parklife Bali, a family-oriented spot known for its food and play areas. Here's a detailed review of my experience:

Cuisine: The culinary experience at Parklife Bali is impressive. The menu offers a variety of well-prepared, fresh dishes that cater to both adults and children. The quality of the food provided a delightful dining experience.

Playground: The playground is well-maintained, demonstrating regular care. It's a safe and clean environment, ideal for younger children. However, it's designed predominantly for kids under 8 years old, and older children might find it less appealing. The play structures are more suitable for a younger demographic.

Pricing: A critical point to note is the entry fee of 150K per child. This price feels steep considering the number of play structures and the age-specific appeal of the playground. Families with older children or those looking for a more extensive range of play equipment might find the cost hard to justify.

In conclusion, while Parklife Bali offers excellent food and a safe play environment for younger children, the high entry fee for the playground might not offer the best value, especially for families with older kids or those seeking more diverse play options.","If you like to bring your kids playing in a sauna , that’s the place to go !…. Super hot. Humid, and I find poor installation for kids.
A few games. Outside. It’s impossible to stay as the heat is unbearable.
Ok. April May are very hot.
Slides doesn’t slide as the plastic is too hot or dirty ?
You need a towel to slide easily
Ground is dirty. With wet areas.
Full of mosquitoes outside. Bring repellent.
You can relax In a small airco area
With only a table. For parents.
Idea is good. But then do it nicely with airco place. Inside. And with modern games.
And change your price.
170000 a kid is TOO Expensive.
We paid 300 k for 2 kids.
A good point.
The staff is Friendly. And the 16 PM Water games are funny for small kids.
Thanks","My daughter had her birthday party organized at parklife and it was absolutely amazing!!!
I really don’t have the words!!
The food is incredible, The stuff is just amazing, caring and a good communication.
For the decoration I just sent photos and had discussions on WhatsApp and I was so amazed to see the results of the decoration.
It was really a fairytale!
They really did what I asked.
The stuff that makes activity with the children are so caring and funny.
Definitely I recommend and I will be back!
Thank you Parklife for this amazing birthday party.","We love Park Life Bali! The kids love it too. I took my young kids who loved the soft play area as well as the lovely green great outdoor play areas (shaded too) The play assistants are fab, and hold different classes (science, craft etc) which is hands on and engaging for the kids. We attended the Halloween events during our stay and the kids were entertained, as were we!  The cafe has great food and drinks and parents can chill and watch the kids play. My kids didn’t want to leave. Highly recommend to families."

We stayed here for 10 days: First of Mr. Kano and Mr. Rai are the outmost Hosts, you could wish for on your holiday. The room, the bed, the breakfast, the room service, everything is excellent! The location as well, is fantastic! No noise from the busy streets and still close to a great lively area! This resort is special, as you feel very connected to the nature of the gorgeous Jungle garden that spreads out throughout the whole resort... and this straight from your luxury room or villa. The yoga space is stunning as well, and has a special atmosphere, due to the classic Balinese old wooden house the practise takes place. We received an absolute genuine friendly and care throughout our whole stay. Can't wait to come back here!","Pathetic experience - the property is built over an open sewer and as it rains it swells up. Has a small open room in the name of reception, that's struggling to fit even 3 people. The location is super bad and to add the path to the hotel is super bumpy and broken slope.

Theres barely any service to call for - had to call thrice for something as basics as water. Asked for basic things like ferry and the reception guy had no idea. The internet connectivity is so bad and patchy.

We took a private pool villa but it opens to the view of the drain and small house so you can't use the room without curtains. And to be honest the pool doesn't even qualify to be called one. The walls are dampy, broken furniture edges and constant sound of frogs, actually makes you feel like you are in a jungle. Just not worth the money, won't recommend for the location, price or service - complete spoiler.","We absolutely lovedddd staying here! The vibes are incredible for any nature lover, while also super luxurious at the same time. The staff just make the experience so much better and are extremely friendly & hospitable. We were honored to meet Rai, Kano & Wayan. They went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and answer all our non hotel related questions as well.","Kalapa is a hidden gem, the tranquility this resort offers makes you feel as if entering another world, a serene paradise.

We enjoyed our stay in the comfy villa. The beds are comfortable and it had everything we need. It is in traditional Balinese style which means the living room is an open area. There's a safe upstairs, but we felt comfortable leaving our stuff in the open room. You have a private garden and you can close the gate, but you can't lock. Which was totally fine by us.

Ofcourse you might run into some ants and small lizards. People who complain about that, don't understand the concept of being in the tropics. It comes with the territory. But everything was spot on clean. The cleaner who comes everyday even does your dishes.

The pool is clean too. Staff is super friendly. There's staff on site 24/7. In the evening and night there's security.

We recommend staying here. Our kids loved it too.","We stayed in a villa which is in a different part of the property. Villa was good. You have to remember that this is a 2 star property and it certainly delivers value. The attention to detail is very good. Staff are great. It is far enough outside of Canggu to be peaceful. The only thing if it is important to you is that you cannot lock any doors, but it wasn't an issue.","Really friendly staff (the local staff at least), and set up is nice. Rooms are very dated and not well maintained. No water pressure in showers and overall a dirty feel. Multiple kids were sick in the hotel, which was most likely because of the pool. Would not go again.","Really enjoyed our stay here, super friendly and highly accommodating staff. The rooms are super comfortable and I like that it is away from the noise and traffic of the major streets. The breakfast at the cafe was a delicious way to start every day. Highly recommended.","I had a great time at united colors of Bali! The rooms are clean and the services are excellent! If you need peace and quiet this place is for you!

☕ 💜
I was super excited to try the food and sadly in my opinion it was super bland, it really had no flavour whatsoever. I had the fine Benedict and the meat was super chewy, so much so that I didn't eat it and the overall dish just lacked flavour, I'm sad to say!

This has nothing against the beautiful Balinese staff but more directed at the owner / manager. Firstly the power has gone out multiple times, both times she stated that it was the whole area where next door was fine.  This meant we had no power or water for hours! Then it went out again which meant no AC which was impossible to sleep. The last time we were in the shower so the electricity and water both went off and we couldn’t find out phones to turn the lights on. There was no tv in the room as stated on website, no restaurant, breakfast on the first 2 days wasn’t a thing until the last day where we did get breakfast.

Booked from 30-12 until 01-01, 2 months in advance because we knew that Canggu would be busy during New Year’s Eve and we wanted to celebrate it in Canggu in a nice hotel. Unfortunately Boho Canggu ruined our New Years Eve. We checked-in and paid the room around 1:30 pm on the 30st. Front office told us that the room was not ready yet so we waited until check-in time to enter the room. After we got the roomkeys, front office told us that we couldn’t stay for 2 nights and had to check out on 31st because they where overbooked because of an error in their system and that we had to leave?! Agoda and Boho Canggu didn’t help us with finding a new place and everything in Canggu was fully booked. In our opinion this is the worst service you can get from a hotel. We understand that a hotel can be overbooked but you can not leave your guests homeless. At least help them to find a new place to stay. During check in I told the front desk that one of us got food poisoning and was very sick. They didn’t care at all. Boho Canggu did nothing for us. They didn’t even offer us to help finding a new place somewhere else. The only thing they said was: we had this error before?! How hilarious is that?

If you're seeking relaxation, fantastic yoga sessions, meditation, and a peaceful mind, this is the perfect spot. Nestled in the heart of Canggu, it's also ideal for exploring diverse places and indulging in delicious cuisine.","Ubuntu was a lovely little spot of peace and stillness next to hectic Canggu. The staff were amazing, the yoga offered beautiful and all the nature was an absolute balm after venturing into Canggu. I travelled solo and felt extremely comfortable. Shout out to Vita for being so warm, kind and caring during my stay. Thank you Ubuntu for everything.","Andrea is a warmhearted person and true professional at the same time, with an amazing vita and so much life experience! Although I have no idea of yoga (I just stayed in her accomodation and took photos for her) I felt the very nice, calm and peaceful atmosphere at the place - can recommend Ubunti Bali to everyone :)","Ubuntu is a hidden gem! The perfect place to enjoy some peace and quiet in busy Canggu. The staff are very kind, welcoming and make you feel at home. Definitely recommend their delicious chai tea and dragon smoothie bowl👌"

My three year old and one year old both enjoyed various items from the menu. Is was great for them to experience genuine food on our holiday.","It was our very first time trying Bakso. The chef helped explain which dish was the most popular, which is the one with pork bone. Every bite was delicious! So tender!  He also suggested us to get the coconut drink with orange. One of the best drinks I've had. It's a must. Highly recommend to check this place out! Also the view is beautiful.","We came here after a full day of travelling to Bali and because of this place we knew our Adventure was off to a good start. A nice place to enjoy amazing food with an amazing view, I enjoyed the Ice Tea because it wasn‘t too sweet. Great service with amazing people. 10/10",Simply bakso soup restaurant with delicious taste… yummy 😋,Lovely bakso place. Ordered the canggu special bakso and the flavour is awesome. The beef rib is cooked to be tender and the meet balls are nice and bitey! Enjoyed the bakso here and will be back here.

The convenient store is just 100 steps away from the room. The staff is very helpful since the day I arrived. They will clean your room up everyday in the same time and the cleaner staff is very nice to knock doors when he needs to clean even in the weekend. However, since the room is very spacious, the airconditioner does not look like very useful. It was still hot sometime in the midnight. I think they should put the airconditioner right above the television to make it better about the room  temperature. About the tv, it is a smart tv but again it is too small with that size of room. The bathroom is very spacious too but I found the stains in closet bowl. Finally, the sliding door is very disturbing when you have privacy in your room. If you open the curtain, then people accrossing your room will be able to see your activity. It can be worst since right in front of the room in the second floor, there is a prayer place open for public. So the option that you can take is only to close the curtain all day long and utilize the light from the bathroom side or turn on your room lamps. With about IDR 2.8 million for 10 days, it is not so bad but if I could turn back the time I would move on the third or fourth day. Thank you Nudel Room for the experiences","Actually staying in the Nudel room just behind the cafe right now. The entrance is through a small alley next to the cafe. Room is spacious. Bathroom is also spacious. Water pressure is good, stabile & consistent (this is important)! Hot water however works only for the first few minutes . I think they’re using gas water heater instead of electric so it has limited capacity. M

The downsides are there’s no shared kitchen & no tv in our room. You can also hear loud bikes even at night sometimes when there’s supposed to be no traffic outfront. Apparently there’s only tv in some rooms as the previous guests asked for it to be removed since the tv was not a smart tv (?) I guess they thought it’s better to not have a tv in the room if it’s not a smart tv? Not sure. But I wish I have a tv in my room.

Haven’t tried the food at the cafe. The guesthouse employees were trying to be very accomodating to our requests, eg : moving room to the one in the corner so it’s less noisy.","Fantastic Cafe, super helpful and friendly staff. We enjoyed our three breakfasts here during our stay in Canggu. So many choices including cooked, healthy breakfasts and delicious juices and coffee. Highly recommend. Tracy and family Perth W.A.","Nothing amazing but decent food at a good price. They have a huge menu so there's something for everyone.  The place is well designed and cozy, but a little loud as it's facing the busiest street in the area.","Clean and centrally located.
- Found bit expensive. But as searched while booking every hotel in Canngu are priced the same or above.
No water bottle kept in room.
e
- Property was super clean and is in the center of city. From here everything is just 2 kms away. If you have a bike this property is perfectly in city centre with a superstore just outside it."

Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here!,"Nice and cozy, centrally located, very friendly staff. If you’re looking for a guesthouse / room to stay for multiple weeks with a good balance in price/quality, this is the place to be! Note: I only stayed here for four nights, friends have stayed multiple months.","We stayed here for more than a month and I  would give them 10 stars I could. This place is magical, staff is super friendly and willing to help, the atmosphere is great, mainly young entrepreneurs and travellers, super close to Batu Bolong, bedrooms are big and clean, the garden and the pool are awesome. It is pet friendly and there are a few people living there long term with their pets, which I love😍","Clean and very spacious room, helpful and friendly staff, and I especially love the bright and luscious garden in the center of the villa.

Do you want to sleep in an affordable price but comfortable experience? You should come and staying here.

I came here and with the money I spent, no regret at all.

They have a cozy and homey communal space like dining room included the kitchen. You are free to use the cooking utensil but remember to wash it after use it.

The bedroom I had, there were 6 clean and comfy beds with fan and AC. They provide you a rack to put your belongings.

It was very quite and clean. The visitor appreciated another guests therefore they will keep the tune down as best they can so you would not feel bothered.

The keeper was very nice, but make sure you have had contacted him before arrival so you would not wait too long to enter your booking.

The bathroom was also clean.
It gives you a unique experience to stay.
And no worries to go around Canggu because this House is near to many cool places around Canggu.","I honestly don't like to post negative reviews. So I'll start with positive, the guy works there Max is very helpful and kind, they provide free drinking water, very close to all the activities. What they could improve: Better communication, improved cleanliness. The place doesn't really look as you may see in the website. That's why when I first arrived I couldn't recognise it. The pool is so funny its like a small fish tank. I was ok staying there as it was my last day.","I was going off the previous reviews and photos and I was a small bit disappointed. The common area was fairly nice, it had some cozy couches and we could rent a scooter there as well. The staff was friendly but the overall appearance was quite underwhelming. It all looked a little thrown together and our room only had one socket and unfortunately no windows at all. The price is totally okay, it's just not very cozy.","The homestay has everything you need to stay comfy: space to do yoga / movement practice, lots of plugs, shared kitchen and fridge, good wifi, a small pool to refresh yourself in hot days and socialize, a interior patio full of plants and wooden decoration. I really appreciate the effort to make the guest happy :)","When I got there, its so comfy with hidden international person protect that place... The keeper had a dog name ""nana"". It got super small clean pond in the middle of the house... Nothing for complained except we had wrong public kitchen, everything perfect and work fine in that place... So happy to stay there,"

We loved the little huts, it's pretty much like sleeping outside with the comfort of aircon and a luxurious bed etc.
Close to town, yet tucked away and quiet. Would definitely come back :)","One of the best stays in budget at Canggu. A hut styled calm cozy stays. Would be ideal for travelers, who are planning to cut down the noise and live with low budget, this would be a great choice.

Host is friendly, and they keep the whole stays so clean. Community out here is also so welcoming and international mostly. Everything is at walkable from the stay; thats the other advantage.","Great value,  traditional huts for a real feel of Bali.  A little too far from the beach to walk,  but easy trip in  Grab for under 50,000Rp. Plenty of food options close by.","It's a great place, I stayed in there 3 months. The people was always very friendly, it's perfect for meet new friends. All the homestay is very clean and beautiful!
Is a private room of bamboo with mosquito net and AC. Shared bathroom, shared kitchen with all the necessary and a clean pool. Near of restaurant, cafes, supermarket and the beach. You can book surf lessons in here and they have scooter available for rent."

Having the entire place to ourselves was the perfect base for our holiday, with the private rooms allowing for each person to also have their own space.

The highlight was the villa staff, who were incredibly accommodating, and always happy to help.

A special thanks to Rhi who ensured all of our needs were looked after.",The place was great. It was surprisingly private and quiet even though it was so close to the busy roads. The pool was awesome and the rooms super cozy. But it was the staff that really put it over the top. Riri was so positive and helpful and the rest of the staff took care of whatever we needed. The best part of each day was chatting with Riri before setting off on adventures.,"OH MY GOODNESS!!! RiRi and her team are incredible! They made us feel welcomed and at home every day. Each morning, they asked what we had planned, and when we got home, we made sure we had a great time. The location is private and quiet even though you are near the road you will never hear it. The pool is great for a soak after a long, hot day or an excellent way to start the day off right. Riri and her staff made our stay memorable and magical. We will visit her and the staff again someday.","The villa is beautiful and close enough to the beach by scooter. RiRi (our host) was one of the most pleasant people I’ve ever met, and everyone else on staff was so accommodating for our big group. Highly recommend!","Overall very nice place to stay. This place have a very nice lounges, bedroom, kitchen, swimming pool.

But there is something annoyed me, the electricity gets down oftenly during my vacation."
