ChIJJ1ZgwemG0S0REZ7tG82pRo4,Santhipala Spring Waterfall,-8.286061199999999,115.02399729999999,"P27F+HHH, Bengkel, Busung Biu, Buleleng Regency, Bali 81154, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=10252068300157459985,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.3,60,,This place was just gorgeous. Easily the cleanest waterfall I've been to in Bali. Total oasis of tranquility. Aside from the spirits I was the only one there. Heavenly and really worth a visit. There are 250m+ of stairs and a 5-10 minute walk to get there from the road.,"This is a private place and belongs to the owners of Santhika retreat. It is not open for general visitors due to it belonging to a native family of healers
I attended with the Guruji from the retreat and took part in the prayers and blessings. Very beautiful and spiritual place",No tickets. Water slow falling,"Let me share my last experience.

I come from near the waterfall with a friend. before that I had come several times and even camped. yesterday we planned to have a picnic for just a few hours and after a long walk, we saw a tourist (woman) doing yoga alone. I didn't intend to disturb her in the slightest, but suddenly she approached and told us to leave. we asked for explanation and she just said that the place is closed and we can't even enjoy the view even from the far side from where she is doing yoga. avoiding the argument, we returned and walked slowly because we were tired. The tourist even shouted and kept telling us to leave until I said that ""we are leaving, but let me walk slowly it's tiring."" I'm trying to find confirmation regarding this and whether such spiritual activities are legal to carry out considering it is a public place where there is not even a sign or notification about these activities at the entrance. imagine if someone comes from far away and has to be disappointed, this will definitely affect the future of the place.","It s started so well, just took the most beautiful walk, arrived almost at the very bottom of the stairs ready to see the waterfall and been refused to see it by a guy because it s apparently a yoga private retreat. No information at the beginning, no sign, nothing. Thought yoga was about sharing and caring not keeping selfishly nature to yourself."
