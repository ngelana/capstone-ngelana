We ordered so many different meals, western, Indonesian, Italian food. Their comment was that the food is good. I had crispy fish, and it was delicious.

For a big group better you make an order in advance so the restaurant can prepare all the meals, since they are limited for the groceries, they give fresh groceries, which is a good thing to know.  So when we arrived, we were not waiting for a long time for the group to enjoying their meals.

Their services are above and beyond. I really appreciate their team work. Their response is also fast. So don't need to worry about it.

Overall, I am satisfied with their food, services and location also beautiful. My guests are all happy.

Next time I will definitely bring my guests to have lunch or dinner on our trip in this area.

Thank you Munduk Farm house üôè","üå± Very good vegan food. Now they have extensive vegan menu with healthier choices than in other restaurants in the area (not everything is fried :)). Portions were really big. We had vegan pizza with mock chicken, tempe satay with peanut sauceand steamed rice and avocado salad and everything was delicious. Lovely staff.
Prices are fair. They charge extra 10% and 6% for tax and service on top of prices in the menu.","Nice place with great view down the hill  where two floors dining area in such a pleasant surrounding is simply an enjoyment. Breezy and spacious~~ Unlike the crowded the town centers in the south, we all have been highly appreciated, a real escape that is traveling about.

Food are surprisely international orientated, moreover they are all delicious. My husband asked how can the local prepare so many various kinds of food in the remote region? good question!

Working staffs are nice, in general the price is lower than those restaurants for comparable quality. Visitors had better take car to get over here because walking distance is far from lake. Parking lot is available.","Ate breakfast and dinner at the place. Very good service and view. Good food. Bad drinks though.. I got the Red Dragon.

They have a beautiful garden with lots of herbs, greens and fruit. Really idyllic!

Would have had and overnights stay, but we found this gem too late ...","Restaurant:
I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. The panoramic view from the restaurant is absolutely breathtaking, providing a serene backdrop to a delightful meal. The staffs here are incredibly friendly and the service was excellent.

Accommodation:
My stay at this accommodation was truly memorable. The place exuded a sense of tradition and charm, making it a unique and enjoyable experience. I had a great stay overall and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a delightful retreat in a picturesque setting."
