The smooth and the rugged meatballs are good. Also the fried meatballs and their fried tofu meatballs is a good choice to get

The broth is nice too, but I add a little vinegar, tomato sauce and sambal to make it perfect to my liking

I will definitely return to this place when I crave for good beef meatballs üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª","The taste is good with many variants of choice.  Generous portion at affordable price. The  service good and quick. Place is ok√®, parking area ok√®, the only downside is sound of traffic. Recommended!","This place has the yummiest broth for their meatballs. You can choose various kind of meatballs such as: beef meatballs, chicken meatballs, steamed fish meatballs, siomay, stuffed tofu, fried meatballs, fried wontons etc. The meatballs are served with either steamed rice or noodles. Each item has its own price range around Rp. 2.000,-. This place is always crowded, especially during lunch time.",The food is tasty and affordable. The service also good. Parking area quite big.,"even the soup is salty (might be because this is not fresh broth-its okay tho)

And the staff was waiting for me even though I sent the car back 1 hour earlier than I booked! Great service. The car that Wayan provides was clean as well. Thanks!,"I can recommend Bali Nusa Rent Car. Contact with Wayan was very good either by mail or whatsapp. A brand new Honda Brio was very realiable on tricky Bali roads. Very good price and very convenient insurance policy. If I were to go through Bali once again I would choose the car. If you are wondering if you are capable of driving on Bali Island just ask yourself 3 questions:
1. Are you a good driver?
2. Are you ok with narrow roads and small parking places?
3. Are you ok with heavy traffic (in town)?

If the answer to the above is yes, do not hesitate to rent a car.

I think that renting a car with automatic transmission is a good idea, since the average speed on Bali is something between 30 and 40 km/h. Do not forget to use low gear when the road is downhill steep.

Just watch out for scams which are almost around every corner (maybe it is good to have a look at opinions on gmaps?), especially those bad ones, so that you get a notion what the scam is about. Go for it and enjoy Bali.","Absolutely brilliant service. I would definitely use again if we are lucky enough to revisit Bali. We were met at the airport by a very helpful member of staff. It was straightforward paperwork and off we drove into the busy roads of Bali. The car was automatic and plenty of space and very clean and modern. We communicated via WhatsApp and email and drop off was again straight forward as we were met at the departures area. The whole experience was stress free and I would urge anyone to use Bali Nusa Rent Car whenever you visit Bali. (We hired a Toyota Avanza for 4 adults and 4 suitcases, plenty of space, really good air conditioning and powerful enough to tackle the mountain roads)","If you looking for a rental car in Bali, I think this is the one you need. Wayan was very responsible with his service, waiting for me outside the airport before I was arrived and car was all ready at the car park ready to go. And when I return, all I had to do was drive to the airport departure lobby and their staff, already waiting for the car. 100% will come back","I visited bali 3 weeks before with my family with 2 kids.we hire a car with driver  by bali nusa rent a car. I can't believe how reliable they are. So i recommend to my colleagues ae well ,they are visiting  to bali winthin next couples of month later and I  hope they will have a same experience as mine. Once again thank you for making  our holiday fantastic ever and I hope we will visit again next year."

Changes to driver, then a different company messaged me, then the new driver told me he would be 15 minutes late, 1 hour later, he was going to be another 15 minutes.
