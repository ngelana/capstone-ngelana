ChIJR8aDjiH30S0RpE0IOruCuJU,View Point for Sunrise and Lake Batur,-8.2463886,115.3800484,"Q93H+6Q7, South Batur, Kintamani, Bangli Regency, Bali, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=10788516648010141092,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.5,62,,"If you want to see the sunrise, you should start best before 3am, the ascend is tough but not too difficult. It can get quite crowded but most of the time you can still pass people if you want to go faster. Amazing view and really rewarding. On the way and at the top you can buy drinks, snacks and souvenirs","The mountain's breathtaking beauty truly captivated me during sunset. As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, the panoramic views from the summit were simply awe-inspiring. The serene atmosphere and crisp mountain air added to the magical experience. Whether you're a nature enthusiast or someone seeking a peaceful retreat, this mountain is a perfect destination to witness nature's grandeur unfold as the sun sets behind its majestic peaks. A must-visit for those who appreciate the beauty of the great outdoors.","Joined Klook Mt Batur Kintamani sunrise 10hrs experience.  Pick up at 2:30am from Kuta/Seminyak arrived around 5am.  Pay extra IDR300,000 to hike up to the peak.
This view point are full of Jeep as this is the only way to come up to starting point","Mesmerizing!!!!!
Early morning trek, you have to start quite early,  as the way up is very crowded, atleast the day I went was. Trek is not so difficult,  it's mostly rocky and little slippery because of small rolling stones and dry sand. Given it was very crowded, it was slow and you can't follow your pace,  as usually people avoid overtaking.
The outcome at the end was just amazing, it was windy, little bit chilling but pleasant. If you feel cold easily carry your jacket or you can rent from the start point,  the guide will help.
We were lucky the sunrise was wonderful with floating clouds, you literally feel on top of cloud.
Down trek was easy and we also experienced the volcanic steam.
If you just want to njoy the view you can take hire the bike both ways or one way, little walk from drop point.
Must do once atleast.","Very good and highly recommended programme.  But it is so intensive, on the way you will sweat a lot and at the top of the Mountain the temperature is low so take enough clothes with yourself (jacket,sweater)"
