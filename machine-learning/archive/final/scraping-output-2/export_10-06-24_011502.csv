This should be stated in the advertising for the hotel. It is possible to order food for these areas, and it is brought from the kitchen, but missing the personal touch. The good part about this hotel is the size and cleanliness of the rooms. If you are simply looking for a clean place to lay your head you don't need to look any further. Bathrooms were also looking a bit sad, clean though so no hygeine issue, but the taps and fitting in the shower and bath were partially stripped of their chrome finish, presumable because of to harsh cleaning chemical being used at some time in the past. Towels and bathroom supplies were all clean and well presented. Breakfasts were standard, nothing special. What this hotel needs is a good manager, who walks the hotel and directs his staff to do their jobs properly. I pointed out a couple of areas that need the attention of housekeeping, and the issues were swiftly resolved. You will not be getting the full 5 star hotel experience, but the prices being charged reflect that! Just have to add that the desk staff were super attentive and did all they could to make our stay enjoyable. This hotel was built to a high standard, and with a little help and support, It could attain those heights again.","AVOID THIS PLACE.
If i could i would give 0 stars to this awful place.
The rooms are dirty and proper old with many broken parts. The sink are rusty and the whole bedroom smells bad with everything falling apart.
The sunbed by the pool is literally rotten , the food is awful and with flies/insects. Staff won‚Äôt help at all. You can ask them for anything and they‚Äôre won‚Äôt even bother to help. The lift smells very bad and it‚Äôs covered in dirt with panels falling apart.
This hotel is a nightmare, literally ruined my stay in Nusa Dua. Avoid avoid avoid .","This was our first stay in Bali during our honeymoon and it was the best we found during our entire trip, it was better than the ""private villas"" we stayed later at. To begin with the staff is courteous, rooms are clean and well maintained, nice rooftop and swimming pool. To add to it, when we requested an early morning packed breakfast (5am) we were delighted to see they providing so many options in the packed breakfast. When they got to know it was our honeymoon they even upgraded us to their signature suite which was icing on the cake. Kudos to the team! And special callout to ""Lily"" for her fantastic services

- Akash & Nikita","Absolutely unworthy. The night view and stay is a nightmare. If you are a vegetarian, then this place is strict NO. Terrible experience with the place. The hotel and live counters are full of flies, rotten food. The swimming pools are not at all maintained well.  If any problem discussed with managemt, they dont respond and do as promised.

Booked through agoda (Agoda preferred property) but very unhelpful.","The rooms were clean, very comfortable, The breakfast also good with complete menu and the staff was amazing. Darren as DOS are also very helpful, They went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Bali."

Originally booked for just a week, we couldn't resist extending our stay to a whole month after falling head over heels for this hotel.

The receptionists, restaurant, cleaning maintenance staff particularly Agu and the restaurant team, were incredibly warm and even took the time to teach us Bahasa. Kudos to Wigi, the hotel manager, for curating such a fantastic team that made us feel right at home.

This hotel seamlessly caters to both travelers and locals alike, making everyone feel welcome.

There's so much more I could say, but time and space are limited.

Highly recommended for families, solo travelers, or anyone seeking a delightful setting with great food and a relaxing swim.

And don't miss the live music every Saturday and Sunday starting at 4pm!","I would like to extend my most deepest gratitude and appreciation for the staff in Graha Socio for the wonderful stay and hospitality I have received. The rooms were cleaned up after every night and the staffs were super helpful in their recommendations for food, places to visit, etc.
I would definitely recommend families to come and stay as they have dream-like facilities for the kids; simple yet eventful. Lovely late afternoons seeing these innocent young beings have so much fun definitely warms the heart.","It might one of the worst hotel that I ever stay in Bali

- not helpful staff
- no regular TV Channel - use your own Netflix access
- no liquid soap, only 1 small soap bar
- thin wall
- there rat crawling on the roof at night
- no lift and no access way for your luggage bag
- on the 2nd day my breakfast box theres no eggs (not consistent with the 1st day)","The room is very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Especially thank you to Dutta. He was very attractive and polite.
See you soon","Wifi is not the most consistent, service is amazing and the people are super nice.

Shelli has been gone above and beyond with organization for our event. She has been extremely helpful in coordinating with music groups, cook, drivers and our other wedding planner. Every little detail was arranged by her to make sure that everything is exceeding our expectations on our special day.

As for the villa, they have amazing decorations and a great pool. Rooms are really clean and comfortable.
The dinner they served for us was arguably one of the best that can be found in Bali.

Villa team was very friendly and you could feel that they really enjoy what they do.
