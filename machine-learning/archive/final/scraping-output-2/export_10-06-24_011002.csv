It's clean and not that packed. Perhaps because it's new I don't know but the staff there is very helpful and nice.

They have hand dryer that probably sound so loud during the night. Lol... But it functioning well and proper. Their toilet also clean. They also provide playground area like other McDonald's and separated place for kids birthday. Love it!

What I like more of this place besides good air-conditioning is that their chairs are not just those stiff plastic chair or one long foam sofa but they also have individual chairs that comfortable made of foam and synthetic. I saw many during my night visits sat there instead of the plastic chairs. It's of course comforting for laid back dinner.

Their staff some of them were noisy at the kitchen that you can hear from outside but if your visit just for fun I think it won't matter. Just tell the cashier I think they'll do something.","So after some time I visit McD. Uffff. I cannot say anything positive no matter how hard I try...
1. Staff except cashier does not speak English.
2. I ordered breakfast wrap and coffee and was there alone. Waited about 7min to find out, that wrap is finished (and cold) , but coffee nobody made, so it waited for me to come and remind them.... Eggs inside wrap was not finished, hopefully will not have bali belly
3. My second try Ice coffee, I wanted with no sugar. But not possible.

Awful service, awful food and drink.","Kemarin hari minggu tgl 8 sept pesen ini di mcd dekat jalan panjang, ga dapet McFloatnya tuh.

Smaller food size, but very tasty choco pie
I came to this place mostly because I was curious with the most happening ""choco pie"". And since it had been quite a while I didnt eat in Mc. Donalds, then I treated myself with Big Mac package. And I was so surprised that Big Mac was much smaller than the last time I ate in Mc.D. Choco pie was so good.

About the restaurant, it is always busy. But surprisingly it is clean and seatings are always available. It also has kids recreation area, and somehow noisy.",Great place to eat and hangout. As always McD,At 5am terrible service. My orange juice I ordered was a cheap brand of orange cordial and Half a container of cold chips and had to wait 8mins to be served. Same as all Indonesia's McDonald's no ice cream at night. McDonald's needs to check the franchises of all their franchises

Review for Spesial Soto Boyolali (SSB):
I recently visited Spesial Soto Boyolali (SSB), and I wanted to share my thoughts on the experience. Overall, I found it to be a decent place that offers a range of Indonesian dishes, with their Soto broth stealing the show.

Let's start with the highlight‚Äîthe Soto broth. It was absolutely delicious! The flavors were rich and well-balanced, and the broth itself was hearty and comforting. Whether you're a fan of the traditional chicken or beef Soto, SSB delivers a flavorful and satisfying bowl of goodness. It's definitely a must-try for anyone visiting the restaurant.

In addition to the Soto, SSB offers a variety of snacks that are worth mentioning. The perkedel (potato fritters) and Tempe were standout choices. The perkedel had a crispy exterior and a soft, flavorful center, while the Tempe was well-seasoned and had a satisfying texture. These snacks make for great appetizers or accompaniments to your main course.

However, I must admit that the satay fell a bit short of my expectations. While it wasn't terrible, it didn't quite live up to the flavors I was hoping for. The meat was slightly dry, and the marinade lacked the depth of flavor that I've experienced at other establishments. It's worth noting, though, that taste preferences can vary, and others might find the satay more enjoyable.

One aspect that stood out positively was the cleanliness of the place. SSB maintains a tidy environment, which adds to the overall dining experience. Additionally, the presence of fans and a parking lot makes it convenient for customers, especially in warm weather or during peak hours.

When it comes to value for money, SSB offers reasonably priced dishes that won't break the bank. While it may not be a top-tier culinary experience, it delivers decent Indonesian fare at an affordable price point.

In conclusion, if you're in the mood for a satisfying bowl of Soto broth and some tasty snacks like perkedel and Tempe, Spesial Soto Boyolali (SSB) is worth a visit. Just manage your expectations when it comes to the satay. With a clean environment, fan cooling, and convenient parking, it offers a decent dining experience that won't strain your wallet.
