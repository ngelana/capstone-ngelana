Basically no-one there and it felt a bit like an abandoned theme park, which was cool.

Yes, most of the park is currently out of action, but it was still fun to explore and it was amazing to see how plant growth and weather had done so much damage in that time.

Can still see a number of good examples of housing from different time periods and areas of Indonesia.

I'm sure it'll be great once it's all fixed back up. They currently have tickets at half price (now 175,000 IDR) which seems perfectly reasonable to me for a good 90min+ wander. Plus, I suppose one could see visiting as a bit of a donation to it getting fixed back up again :)","Actually the place is too goood according to the pictures ‚Ä¶ but currently the place is not maintained and it is full of broken houses n stuffs.. no staffs are there since some time now.. and there was one single staff at the entry explaining abt the current situation of the place and showed us the pictures of the current state. They are still charging half the entrance fee as before, if we want to go around and see the place.","beautiful place, you can see and learn Indonesian culture here. It has so many traditional Indonesian houses and when we visited some houses, the employees there played the traditional music and do the traditional dance. My mom joined the dance happily. the weather was very nice, the wind was a bit cold but as we were walking in such a huge area, we could bear the cold breeze. all employees were very nice and friendly. we can also see traditional fabric, old stamps, traditional shadow puppets, handicraft, etc. There were some instagramable spots to take pictures, including a rice field. we bought entrance ticket which included lunch at an online seller. Time spent around 4 hours including lunch. you can also buy ticket for traditional activity such as making batik, wear traditional clothes and taking pictures.","As previous comment states that the place is going through renovation and rebuilding phase. They will hard hit by covid and with the lack of funding and investment, it‚Äôs a slow progress. Currently, they‚Äôre offering 50% discount for entrance. I think it still worth a visit, with the building unkept and nature taking over it gave the place another element and eerie vibe which was a fun experience. Plus, with less people you can wonder around freely. The lady at reception kindly gave us a tour detailing how things looked and operated pre covid. She mentioned they used to have different ethnic groups showcasing their lifestyle and artwork in the house they represent. Even more interestingly, these people actually lived in theses houses and maintained the house and surroundings. Unfortunately, with covid and lack of tourist they all had to move back home hence the unkept situation. I really hope this place can get back on its feet. It provides rich insight to many Indonesia‚Äôs ethnic groups way of life and opening up their cultural to the public.",History of Indonesian Islands from prehistoric time to vision of future. Absolutely amazing gathering of traditional houses. Nice friendly stuff. However exhibition must be updated. Some buildings needs fixings. Institution itself saw better times. Still worth of visiting.

And I must say, it didn't disappoint! The food was delicious and authentic Indonesian, the staff was super friendly and helpful and the view was simply amazing. It was such a pity that we were the only ones there, since this location deserves much more recognition. Hopefully they will grow more and more, wish them all the best!","One of the best trip ever.
