However, like many areas in Bali, it likely has cultural significance to the local communities, possibly with ties to fishing or spiritual practices. Over time, it has become known for its stunning scenery, attracting tourists seeking beautiful landscapes and surfing enthusiasts drawn to its consistent waves. While there may not be a detailed historical account, its natural beauty and popularity have likely contributed to its place in Bali's tourism industry.

Balangan Beach is characterized by its breathtaking natural beauty, with golden sands, crystal-clear waters, and towering cliffs framing the coastline. It's renowned among surfers for its consistent waves, making it a popular destination for both beginners and experienced surfers alike. The beach maintains a laid-back atmosphere, offering a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of Bali's more crowded areas. Additionally, its relatively secluded location adds to its charm, attracting visitors seeking a quieter and more serene beach experience. Overall, Balangan Beach is known for its stunning scenery, excellent surfing conditions, and tranquil ambiance.","I visited the beach 2 days to surf and it was really different. In usual there is to say that it is really busy for surfing, a lot of surf instructors with students too. The first time I didn‚Äôt really liked it to much, because it was low tide and you had to pass all the sharp stones to get into the water. The second time (the video) was way better, you could go out of the water without the fear to cut your feet.
In general I would say it‚Äôs a good beach for immediately surfers and for tanning :) üèÑüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è","Nice beach. Very less people compared to other beachs in the area. In the morning you can find more than 100 surfers in the water!
Low tide in the morning and high tide around noon.
Compared to Dreamland which is over crowed Balangan Beach is quiet.
Families are coming around noon when high tide is there.
150k for 2 matelas / 350k for 1h private surfing class and 600k for 2h. You also need to pay 2k to enter the parking.","If you‚Äôre a surfer this is your beach in Uluwatu, very big so everyone has space.
If you enjoy seeing people surfing there‚Äôs a lot of warungs with excellent views.
But this beach is not for bathers, lots of trash in the sand. Found a dead blowfish in the shore :-(

Free entrance","Absolutely stunning beach to visit. Gigantic waves to watch the surfers. It says you can snorkel here but I definitely wouldn't recommend as the sea will wash you away. One thing I really appreciated was the guys who care for the beach chairs, only 100k for the whole day and I watched them use a cleaner on each chair after people left. Very impressed with the views and the people who care for this beach!"

I came for lunch and sat at a balcony seat and was promptly served, such friendly staff! I got the vegan bowl and it was fresh and good portion. Later, I decided to come here and check out the sunset and have a snack. I got the vegan rice wrap and those were super yummy as well. Then finished with a fresh coconut that even had the name of the cafe! The staff was so caring, they knew the coconut was warm so they put ice in it for me. The atmosphere was also amazing, right on the beach, playing great music, and just right for the sunset. It‚Äôs tucked away right by the cliffs where all the surfers paddle out, only accessible by walking on the beach. Wonderful way to end my trip in Uluwatu!","What a gem... hands down best food across the entire menu. And we tried almost all. Breakfast Jimmy Benedict, amazing combo.

This place just finished their renovation and became more minimalist and modern in terms of the interior which is nice.

The view from up here is breathtaking. Gorgeous blue water and blue sky. You can also see green cliff ahead.

The food is also as amazing. Most of the food that I‚Äôve tried are so spot on. I would recommend you to try their chicken wings, eggs benedict and tuna poke bowl. The price is still reasonable aswell.","Nice place directly on the Balangan beach, went for a meeting with a friend, good juices, good service, good location. Probably new the place, I don't know, missing some vibe, empty spaces to be filled up with decorations, personal opinion, price not very popular but this look like a proper place, clean and with an international standards for the operations. Will go back? YES.  Internet should be improved, same as the QRIS payment option!",We had great coffee and delicious fresh food at this clean and modern cafe right on the water's edge while watching the surfers at Balangan.

Once upon a time I believe that this hotel would have been lovely. However, I write this review to warn others before thinking of choosing this hotel as an option.

My partner and I had chosen this hotel to stay over the Christmas and new year period as a nice relaxing treat. This hotel is anything but that.

Overall, we arrived quite late in the evening due to a long travel day, we were shown to our room only to find bed bugs in the bed and mattress, we then were shown 3 more rooms we to which all of them had bed bugs in them. The linen in each room was somewhat stained. One room had a TV the others did not. The rooms smell old and musty and they have many other bugs in the room.

The bathrooms were not clean in any of the rooms we saw, water stains on the top, advising it has not been wiped down. Dirty bath tub and the shower was not clean.

We had to stay here one night due to being shown so many other rooms to try and get one right, it was around 3 AM when we had to call it and that meant that we could not find anywhere else, also the fact it was almost New Year‚Äôs Eve. We checked immediately out the next morning.

We did speak to the manager who helped as much as he could and advised he would issue a refund through our booking site once the request had been sent through.

I did this the next day.

Getting our money back has been a hard and very long process due to the hotel ignoring all of my emails, however, we have now been advised by our booking provider that after 5/6 days of persistent emails, that the hotel will issue a refund, and rightly so.

Although, the hotel have not emailed me to even remotely apologise for what a disgrace they presented to us.

At the end of the day, this hotel should not be advertising itself as ready for customers, and I do not understand how it has a high star rating review on some booking sites.

IDreamland hotel, please sort out these standards and stop allowing paying customers to book this hotel until you are ready for them.","BEWARE OF THIS HOTEL!!! bedbugs will eat you all night! it's a living hell! a nightmare! smelly toilets, no cleaning at all for the rooms. and bugs and insects everywhere!

we booked it for one month. we couldn't stay more than couple of days! we asked for a refund but they said we don't have valid claim

AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!","BEWARE OF THESE SCAMMERS! Came back to my room to realize $1,200 is missing from my luggage. Went to reception to find another dude with same issue. After speaking to the manager he told me they are not responsible and advised me not to keep the money in the luggage. What a joke. I think they are all connected to this scam. They have cameras in the hallway but they keep making stories why they cannot review them. Stay away or at least DO NOT leave your money in the room. They will dig thru your luggage. My money was hidden but they still got it. THIEFS!!!!","I don‚Äôt think I can quite highlight just how bad this hotel is.

On our way to the property, I typed it in on maps to see how far away it was and read the most recent review out of interest that was also a 1 star review. (I think since then there has been 4/5 more).

Then we noticed a pattern of reviews all mentioning bed bugs. We thought that we should go in with an open mind but as we got closer to the hotel the bad feeling got worse and worse. There are no shops close by, the roads have no streetlights and it feels like an abandoned section of Bali.

When we got to the room we wanted to check the mattress before we unpacked due to the high volume of previous reviews which all mentioned this bed bug issue. I‚Äôm sure you can guess where this is going :)

Bed bugs.

Second room‚Ä¶ bed bugs.

By the time we get shown a third room, it is around 1 am and we have no idea of where else we can go. It seemed a tiny bit nicer than the previous two but we still found bed bugs. Slept on the end of the bed with all our clothes on and left first thing in the morning.

The only slight positive was that the hotel manager was understanding and advised us we would get a refund upon request to Agoda. However I cannot say that we have received this refund and we have sent 3-4 emails to chase this up with no response on their end.

Good luck if you‚Äôve already booked, and if you haven‚Äôt, swerveeeee this place!

Video of the final room but a bed bug crawling on the pillow. Pictures of dead bed bugs, and the dirty mattress which was covered in what looked to be eggs.","This place is now called ‚ÄúThe Rich Prada Hotel‚Äù which is hilarious because this represents everything modern Indonesian.  You enter the property and a whole wall has either fallen off or is waiting to be constructed?

You walk into reception and it looks like and feels the pictures, then you hang out in lobby, since there apparently isn‚Äôt a pool contrary to all travel sites, and you see the age and poor cleaning of this place. But still generally cosy.

They take you to your room and the stairs are not completely cleaned, the hallways are poorly lit (possibly intentionally?), some stairwell windows show unpleasant courtyard views.

You get to the room and they are dated but comfortable. Mini fridge, tea kettle, free water bottles, nice but slightly crowded bathroom but nice soaker tub, Japanese toilet and spa style shower.
BUT NO TV!?  You see the void on the wall where there possibly was one before, but nothing, just old yellowed paint.

The property is in the impressive Dreamland complex that has a very Disneyland feel and hotel is on a seaside golf course. But this hotel is in desperate need of capital injection and updating.  They did say the pool will be open by summer 2024 but this information was not reported to booking sites. Not sure how it maintains 5stars on these sites, but the google reviews are accurate.  I would avoid as there are so many more places in the area that are better maintained for less money.

Will update if god forbid I end up with bed bugs."

We had a private bungalow which was really lovely. Our booking included breakfast and in hindsight would probably not recommend only because you are limited to 4 choices. The restaurant explained that it is because it included a fruit juice and fruit selection.  The other breakfast options had to be an 'extra' because we opted in, despite them being a cheaper option than the included 4 options. Did not make sense when I enquired . Overall it certainly did not spoil our stay but felt that the resort could review this with the restaurant.
The wall down to the beach is steep and steps are very uneven. The beach offers surfing and snorkeling opportunities.
Staff are incredibly friendly and go out of their way to be helpful.  Number of reports close by which offer alternative meal options if looking for some variety.","Only went for lunch by the pool.
The location is stunning, very well curated, incredible garden with all the bungalows scattered, two relaxing swimming pools and an astounding view on Balangan wave. We had an amazing fish based lunch and a chilled afternoon by the pool. Absolutely recommended to take a break from the caos around.","La Joya Balangan is a very nice hotel with beautiful style. If you‚Äôre looking for a small paradise outside of the real touristique area to relax, this is the place for you. The staff is really friendly and helpful. If you have any request they will do their best to help. You have access to the beach where you can go surf, which is really good for beginner. The manager Anton is really helpful. Don‚Äôt hesitate to talk with him if you see him, he will give you some tips and recommend you places to go visit/eat and can help you book whatever you want to do. The scooter available to rent are in perfect condition. There is yoga class available in the morning and in the evening with a teacher that is really  friendly, perfect to relax early morning or at the end of the day.  I highly recommend this place if you‚Äôre looking to relax and be far from crowded touristic places. The breakfast is amazing and the portion are quite big !","Wish I could give this hotel 0 stars. Do not go here!! I‚Äôve never written a review before but appalled at how horrible this hotel‚Äôs customer service is. They are rude and disrespectful. They asked me to specify the tragedy in my family when I stated I need to cancel my reservation due to a family issue. Completely invasive and beyond disrespectful. The lack of empathy and professionalism. They would not make an exception, under the circumstances, for a non refundable booking 3 weeks in advance! Do not support them.","The bungalow no soundproof I couldn‚Äôt sleep for two nights, bed is way too soft. And the curtains don‚Äôt cover the open concept door much so light comes in. The bungalow deck is broken need fixing for safety. Nice view up from cliff tho, and nice two large pools. Food is quite expensive, water is not included (find it quite stingy of hotel to do this). Nothing much to do around, it‚Äôs very quiet. Beach access is great. Coffee not so nice btw. Food is excellent. For a two nights kind of stay up the cliff, this place not so bad and wifi is very good. Beware of the male yoga teacher, he is rude and not yogi at all. To be fair, it says 3-star hotel.. but it‚Äôs like 4-stars style and pricing. It‚Äôs alright overall but not fantastic."

The air con doesn‚Äôt work, the windows barely close. The floors creek a lot. Loud enough to wake the whole bungalow. The free breakfast is fruit and dry toast.

There‚Äôs live music till 10pm Friday and Saturday night and it‚Äôs right next to your bungalows. So if you want any peace a quiet before 10pm forget it. Multiple people left and moved when we were there.

Advertised as family friendly but it‚Äôs far from. Too loud for sleep and our toddler overheated from the broken aircon so much that he suffered heat stroke and we had to leave.

We were denied a refund for the remainder of our stay. Appalling.","Amazing place really close to Balangan beach, only 3 minutes walking (where you can find several surf schools by the beach). You can hear the waves from this place. Street lighting around is not strong so it is really good to see the sky and stars (if not cloudy).

- Really beautiful and calm in the middle of nature.
- Garden is very green and well taken care of.
- Nice pool in front of the restaurant

I would book again when I come back to Bali. I stayed here for 2 nights, booked via Agoda. I got a room with an aircon and fan (I read some reviews, their room only have a fan). The room was clean spacious, it was built with bamboo and wood, very cozy. The bathroom is open air, next to a jungle. They provided water, coffee and tea, soap and insect repellent. The bed have a mosquito net and the bed was very comfy. The food in the restaurant was very delicious and got a big serving. They have a 15% service charge if you order in the restaurant. The whole place was just clean and well maintained. I really enjoyed my stay there. They have these 2 stray dogs which were abandoned by the owners but they somehow live there now.

Unfortunately the location is a bit far away. You do have Balangan beach which is a nice left break for surf but if you aren‚Äôt surfing, options on food, shopping and nightlife are limited or non existent.

They only provide water upon arrival but not during the stay, the food was ok, the sink for bathroom wasn‚Äôt clean and the trash can lid was pretty gross. All minor things but still make an impression.","If you are staying at a hotel for a couple of days or a week you would think that the hotel would supply you with water. There is only the welcoming drink and that's it. On top of that they will charge close to triple the price compared to a store so you have to go out your way for water.

The staff were amazing and helpful

Pool facilities were great as well as the restaurant food variety

The location was a bit far from the main attractions","Room overall was good but staff was unfriendly and weird.
Location was a bit far from most things.
I came home at night once and asked the security guard if I could still buy water and he said no, so don‚Äôt forget to buy water because you don‚Äôt get any near the hotel.
When we paid in the End we asked if there was a fee on the card and there is, wich for such huge sums is kind of dumb, because you probably don‚Äôt carry that amount of cash around, so prepare to get enough cash beforehand or pay more."

A little less touristy! There is very little to do in the town itself, there are a few restaurants. The beach, on the other hand, is only a 5-minute walk from the accommodation, a real surfing beach. Less suitable for people who want to swim in the sea because the surface consists of large stones/rocks. The room was beautiful, nice clean bathroom, spacious balcony and a wonderful bed and air conditioning.

Great for surfing.","Stunning small resort in a relatively quiet area of Bali with beautifully well designed villa / rooms . We‚Äôve been here twice now and would return again. The staff are so friendly, the owner is lovely and the food is amazing. 5 minute walk to the beach, great surf spot & Not to over developed as yet either.","Ohhhh
I have a good time staying here.
My pavilion is so beautiful and perfect for honey moon type of trip! ^^
So romantic, it‚Äôs just that they play too much English music,
I suggest to put playlist of World Music, adding some spanish, french, Italian, Portuguese music mixed would be a lot more appreciated üòÑ

The staffs are the best part of this hotel, they are all so kind and gentle and friendly‚Ä¶

I will be back soon!
ü§ì but don‚Äôt forget about my advice!
Hahaha

Merci, Gracias üôèüèº","Everything is perfect ! Everybody is so nice and very friendly. We aslo got to talk to the managers and they are also so nice ! The staff seems very happy and they are laughing together which creates an incredible mood. The service is, of course, perfect. The restaurant is particularly good, each piece of food and drink is delicious. The room is very comfortable and cozy, and the whole resort is beautiful in each and every way. The spa is also very nice, i've had one of the best massage. I highly recommend it. We couldn't dream of a better place to stay around Jimbaran !","This resort is a gem. It is only small but well kept and staffed. We stayed here for three nights. The bungalows are cute and super clean. The service was fantastic, special mention to Komara and Julie. The location is a bit remote but fine if you have a scooter or other transport. It is in middle of country side with roosters crowing and cows mooing but in my opinion it all just added to its charm. Great little escape from the busy buzz of everything. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you Le Yanandra!"

Although had a few comments and feedback. It‚Äôs advertised as daily yoga but there‚Äôs none and we wouldn‚Äôt have booked it otherwise - it should not be advertised on the board outside the hotel or on website. We didn‚Äôt have running water for the stay in the evening or morning. This is not that great for the amount we paid. Also no options for vegan milk for coffee which was a little disappointing. Lovely place but when you‚Äôre paying this price you do expect the basics like running water","My partner and I had the most amazing week here. The rooms were well kept, clean and stylish. The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept so well. The hosts were incredible and looked after us so well, helping us with booking massages, recommendations for dinner, organising surf lessons and the list goes on.

Not to mention the sensational breakfasts and lunches, the food was such a highlight for us and meant we didn‚Äôt want to leave white palm.

Honestly this will be our new go to hotel for the next time we come to Bali. Absolutely perfect! Can‚Äôt fault it!","A special Thank you to Petra,Stephanie and Acier for creating such a beautiful experience at white palm.
Visiting this beautiful hotel felt more like visiting a really good friends house, the team felt more like family.
The hotel is beautifully designed, the rooms are are set up perfectly. Everything is clean and organised.
Great location in a nice and quite neighbourhood, 2 minute walk to a beautiful beach and a few minutes away from the restaurants.
The team at white palm hotel went above and beyond to make our holiday experience relaxing and enjoyable.
The food served is absolutely delicious along with the ice cold beers by the pool is outstanding.
Thank you all for the best hotel experience.
Keep up the great work and thank you again for a great service.","We had the best time ever!
The location is beautiful and the staff super friendly.
The food is the best I have had in Bali.

I highly recommend this boutique hotel to anyone wanting to have a good time.

We will come back!

PS: to our fellow Australians, the coffees are amazing!","People working there are amazing, so kind but unfortunately the owner is simply not. He does not care. It is sad to see that the main problem of the hotel is it's owner. We could not feel welcome and the atmosphere was a bit weird mainly when he was around and it wouldn't an issue if the hotel was big, but the plus of a boutique hotel is to be able to have a quite cozy atmosphere and it didn't not happen.

I recommend this place if you‚Äôre into the slow holiday, quiet, less touristy. Needs better security at night as a drunken man ended up banging on our door in the middle of the night.","I was visiting my clients whom stayed in this hostel, and I was questioning their sanities and intelligences, until I came to the conclusion, they just do not have any common sense and class.
If you could only afford this hostel, please, work harder.
The paradise in the name is kind of an insult to the Balangan village, if this is a paradise, well, maybe most people will prefer to be homeless than stay in here.
You literally could feel the dirtiness just by looking at its lobby.","Great location and honestly quite okay considering cost vs location however the facilities are falling apart. Plenty of moisture in the room turning out into a smelly place needing heaps of ventilation. Heaps of garbage all around the hostel, specially down in ground level.
Receptionist was quite little helpful on our checkin and after find out the double room that we actually booked wasn‚Äôt available and did nothing more than offering cancelling the booking, end up in a twin room.
It‚Äôs a venue that if they would invest a bit in painting and maintenance would completely look way nicer but for some reason it‚Äôs just left",The location is really nice close to the beach. The room was really old-school and definitely needed a renovation. The bathroom was a bit broken.,"the dogs are cool! They are just protecting us! Love you and the place, thank you!

Despite the many defects, our children had fun in this water park. The fried rice, which you can get as a snack in the bar, is cheap and tasty. The negative list is long: In principle, the park is ready for demolition. Everything looks in a bad shape. I have even discovered safety-relevant deficiencies, which may create a serious risk for children. For example: Unsecured power cables, sharp-edged tiles and completely rusted and ruptured supports for the slides. The men's restroom was a total disaster for me. It was probably not cleaned for years. There was no toilet paper available. In addition, the price-performance ratio is bad, because a big part of the park was not in function. With all the defects, I would not bet that the water treatment is still working. Currently the park makes a rotted impression. We are from Europe.","A great and affordable place.. but we need paid extra for sit and relax gazebo since no other seating area available. the location pretty remote from Denpasar City but  worth it since hardly to find the same offer in Denpasar.. there were also light food such as Indonesian Meetballs, Chicken noodles with affordable price","The ticket prices are great for locals and cheap for foreigners. 30,000 for adults and 25,000 for kids. It is a fun family day out. However, covid has hit this place hard with a lot of rides not working completely well, and the active pools are not completely clean. Lots of bugs and some algae. The wave pool is completely closed and quite disgusting. I hope they start fixing the park, and I would be happy to pay a higher fee for entry if things were operational.","As far is ok, but for sensitive skin do not enter the water , I get itchy on my skin","cheap, good place to take pictures, kids would love to swim there"

Although it was quite far away from restaurants and shopping so expect to  rent a moped or a car. But there‚Äôs only a 20 min walk to the beach so I can‚Äôt complain too much. And the beach was lovely as well.
Overall a great stay!","Place has a lot of potential. It's a bit older than it looks. They are doing lots of renovations to upgrade it and improve the overall quality of the hotel. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Food from the restaurant was delicious! The manager of the restaurant was great. He's funny and always happy to serve you. The rooftop was beautiful. I added some pictures of it.
It's on the golf course and you have an amazing view of it from the roof.
Perfect for sunset watching.
Rooftop would be great for a small wedding!
The hotel is massive and has a coffee shop and a fancy restaurant on the upper floors.
The only issue was that the AC smelled funny when it was on.
Hopefully they fix it!!!","Location is good while the service is quite bad.

1. If you wanna stay book with them directly at the hotel, it's cheaper most likely!
2. The bad was not clean when we checked in.
3. The staff at the front desk was not helpful to solve our issue.","hotel Rich Prada aka Ululani if ‚Äã‚Äãyou value your things, don‚Äôt even think about staying here! The cleaners steal things, and the staff shrugs and pretends as if nothing happened! Use perfumes and personal hygiene products! The cameras are deliberately not turned on so that it is not visible which of the service personnel enters the room. The hotel offers drugs and prostitutes work, apparently the hotel knows about this, but carefully hides it, this is where such service comes from! the service personnel are apparently doing test work after the colony. Everything looks very decent at first glance until you check in! Be careful, the cleaners are rummaging through personal belongings and if there is money lying around, they will definitely start to disappear a little bit at a time! men are stolen, men's things disappear!"

It seemed almost new and was very nice looking. We had a 10 mo old baby with us and as the villa is open where the roof meets the outer wall it got very warm inside and the airconditioner did not cope fully with that. There was neither any mosquito-net around the bed. We did not sleep very well due to the temperature in the room and had to check out after the first out of 5 planned nights. The staff and the design of the villa there is not much to complain about however it did not fit us this time. The area is under construction and is probably much nicer in a few years when the surrounding construction is completed, I would assume with more restaurants to follow also. As of now there is not much to do in the area, there are a few restaurants down by the beach but they would need refreshing too as it was not nice by the time of our stay. La reserva is probably a very good choice in a couple of years when the area is more developed, however note that it gets hot in the villa.","It was quite an experience. We booked and stayed at the Main Villa for 3 nights. At first glance the place was neat and staffer was nice when we arrived.

First thing we realise when we got into our villa is a green swimming pool and with floating dead bugs. The staff told us it was due to the rain on the previous day and small pools are hard to maintain? on the next day, they offered us ""free access"" to the share pool that we have no choice but to accept. Not sure if they know why people would book a private villa when they can pay less for a share villa. Anyway....

Then we discover the toilet 99% disfunctional, every time the toilet gets used, it clogged ups and everything stays afloat until you call them to unblock it. Their exact response is ""the toilet clogged we are sorry it's out of our control"", it was disgusting as each time we uses the toilet every pops back up and you will need to call them not unblock it each and every time. - this is one most important amenity that should be disclosed on the advertisement.

We leave the air con so our room stays chill when we come back from our outing. On the last night, the air con magically stopped working and only producing fan air. And it's apparently our fault for putting it onto auto mode.

Breakfast is free - but you will need to cook it your self.

Location - it's in the middle of nowhere, unless you love and dies for the beach (10mins walk) the closes Mart is about 20mins drive away.

Verdicts: I have been to Bali 6 times for the pass 15months, stayed in 4 villas and can't get worst than none functional toilet and green pool in Bali.

Advice: look around as there's better villas around.","Loved our staying here! The rooms are just perfect! The small kitchen is a plus, and I liked the breakfast (you are provided with all necessary to make your own toast, coffee, and eggs, and a fresh fruit platter).
There are construction works going on next door, but it didn't really bother us.
The shared pool was clean and quiet.
Location is nice to be near the beach, walking distance to caf√©s and restaurants, however I would recommend hiring a scooter if staying for a few days.","The place would be almost perfect, as this is remote, but still reachable by motorbike.
Even though it is indicated that there is a construction ongoing right next door, it unfortunately destroys a bit the impression. Once it is over, the villas will be very nice.
The staff is very friendly and helpful.
The beach is close.
The self-made breakfast is a good idea, and the quantity and quality are very good. Unfortunately the milk for the caffee was sour twice out of three occasions.
We were not lucky with the cocroaches the last night, we found too many of them in the bathroom. If there was a mosquito net installed on the window that cannot be closed, probably there would not be that many bugs there.","We‚Äôve spent a week in the private pool villa It was an amazing experience! the villa is perfect for a couple
The hosts and all people working there were nice and kind
A few steps from the beach and near a cool bars zone"
