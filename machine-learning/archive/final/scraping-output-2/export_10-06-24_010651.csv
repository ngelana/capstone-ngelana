Don't order Grab from here, either the same problem. Ended up having my order canceled, it took over an hour just to process.

Came in for early lunch one day. Only one person working register and packing food orders. I am very confused as to what ALL the other workers are doing there. I see people in the back and some cleaning. But no one is helping the front person pack and take orders.

About 40 minutes later, our order came out. We ordered 5 pieces, the original recipe, and 2 orders of the strips. I have no clue in the world as to why it took so long. Everyone after us got their food first.

Just don't bother coming here waste of time.","Been coming to this exact KFC since as long as I can remember and boy is this place still as delightful as ever. I read that some were dissatisfied with their visits but as im writing this review i would say that the service is satisfactory, with short preparation time, and awesome taste","Cleanliness, Quality, Product, Service and Parking are all excellent. It would be in our opinion the best KFC in Bali. We are not Big KFC eaters but i would say watch out Maccas Sanur.","My order is 16500 and pay 17000, The casher doesn't give change. This happens all the time in Bali and is a bad experience for tourists.","Sacrifice takes on a unique character, and one thing is for sure - whenever you indulge in chicken, rice will always accompany it."

The warung has outdoor and ondoor seating, and more seating upstairs. We sat upstairs and there are 2 staff who look after those who sat upstairs so guests don't have to wait until a staff come up. There's hand wash basin as well. The warung is clean.

The food is amazing, fresh and delicious. The serving is big. There are many items to choose from and many we have not heard of. The staff was able to answer all of our questions such as- bulung boni is seaweed, bubuh is bubur, etc.

There are many dessert choices as well and we love what we ordered - es nangka mutiara, es teler durian and es cappuccino cincau. There are more to try next time.

With the amount of food we ordered, the total was surprisingly cheaper than what we thought. Very affordable.

For ordering - they give you menus and a pad to write your own, and you passed it to the staff. The order came out fairly quick too.

There is a toilet and it's clean enough."

No window in room  so you need to out during the day. Sleep/rest only in room.
Value for money as short walk to swimming beach & local restaurants.
If u like active night life, Sanur is not for u.","Nice quiet place to stay for a night before heading to Sanur harbor. The staff is professional and the place is a mini hotel. Other guests staying there are also a respectful crowd and it always felt safe and restful. Hot water and AC and good WiFi. The common area was good for doing your work, taking the free Nasi Kuning breakfast, and the hot/cold water refill dispenser was really a big plus. The hotel entrance is a bit hard to find as it’s behind and not facing the front. There’s KFC nearby and also eateries along the side that’s not very well advertised but is there if you walk a bit further after KFC. There’s a traffic zebra crossing to get to Dublin Donuts and the side to Sanur Harbor. At a traffic cross junction. The bathroom is split into toilet and shower which was nice. The room had hangers and closet space. Bed was comfy. Room would be nice if had more ventilation and less claustrophobic.","The Alley City Hotel must be the minimum for the european standards. For 215k IDR / night, you have a large bed, a sink, a toilet and a shower. There's even the air conditionning and a little TV. The room is very small but it's very affordable.

The rooftop terrace is a fantastic feature, offering a peaceful spot to work or simply relax and enjoy some downtime. The inclusion of a fully equipped kitchen was also a great touch, adding to the convenience of our stay.

What truly made our experience memorable was the incredible hospitality shown by Yani, the owner. Her kindness and attentiveness were remarkable; noticing we were under the weather, she kindly made us tea daily and treated us to mangosteen and sweets. It's rare to find such a genuinely caring and welcoming host. Yani's hospitality alone makes Umah Bagus a standout destination.","Incredible value for money.

It was different from our Indian menu and it was super good.,"Good place to have a pizza when we are in Bali. The place is very strategic as it is closed to our hotel. The guy explained us with patient as my son would like to ask a lot of questions about the tastes. He would like to order K Pizza but it is spicy therefore we end up to order Meatza 😀

a comfortable location in the center of the hectic streets of Sanur, a lovely area with artistic decorating that creates an enticing impact on the hearts of clients. The drinks themselves are quite great, and the cuisine is also really tasty, but it needs to be improved in detail so that the restaurant's brand value does not suffer.

If this is your vibe, you will like it. Seems like it's run by some hipster youngsters. The menu is interesting but unfortunately they don't have decaf coffee so I didn't try their coffee, my husband did. I tried their lemon tea which was surprisingly nice. They put a slice of lime (not lemon) in it so they should've named it lime tea!!

The coffee that they recommended was Es kopi Kebun or Es Kopi Pisang. We got es Kopi Kebun for my husband. It's iced coffee with condensed milk and red coconut sugar. My husband liked it.

The place was quiet. There was some music at the background but not too loud. There are some youngsters working on their laptops.

Toilet waa clean despite being hipster haha

Looking for this place was a bit difficult at first. From the main road , look for the sign NUBEK, then you will only see the parking lot (small one). And behind the bushes you will find an entrance to the cafe.

We didn't expect the place to be that hipster..too hipster for our liking but it's still good nonetheless.

Es Kopi Kebun and lemon tea cost around 40k IDR altogether (4 SGD).

They sell some croissants and baked goods but they are not made in house. They sourced it from another bakery.","Good place with good coffee! The place is hidden. You may see it like a parking lot from the outside. Once you get in, it's quite spacious. You may choose to sit outdoors or indoors. I sit indoor and they provide plugs near the table. I tried the Kopi Pisang which means banana coffee, it's kinda sweet but still good. Their french fries also taste good. The wifi is not that strong for work tho.","One of my comfort cafes located in Denpasar. The food, sweets, and drinks sre worthy and they are very affordable. What I personally love the most is the cozy ambience that you can get in both the indoor and outdoor space. The warm tone and slightly dark lighting makes the place comfortable, if you feel a little hot you can definitely sit inside, but once it turns darker you might want to go out and sit between the garden. They also have books you can borrow and read! Overall absolutely in love with this place. Recommended for those who want to chit chat, or do some work on your laptops.","Real example of hidden gem, it's really hidden from the street if you're not looking for it. The place is mostly outdoor, plenty space for parking, and fast good wifi. But beware of mosquito especially at their outdoor on evening. Price and taste are standard, overall maybe it's best for hangout but not for WFC.","Really liked their Beef Nubek, so delish. Their caramel macchiato is also okay. Nice atmosphere, suitable for working. Not too crowded in the morning, quite crowded in the afternoon-evening. Sometimes their WiFi is slow but it’s still okay lah. Truly a hidden gem 👌"

Unfortunately 1/10 was ‘nyepi’, we couldn’t proceed with our plan. Hence there are no were for us to hop around, creepy feeling walking out the alley. It takes about 700 meter to the pier.

No one was at front desk and I had to walk to second floor to find someone. He helped show me my room, and I got settled in.

The rooms are pretty big and on a quiet street. However I noticed the bed sheets looked very old, and did not have a fresh laundry smell to them, so I used my own travel blanket to lay on. Hope they can get new ones for future guests.

They provide breakfast by the pool or second floor balcony. This place is a nice hideaway, but it was a bit tough communicating with the hosts. They had stoic expressions, and I had to initiate my check in and check out.

It’s a good location near where all the ferries leave for the other islands, but would prob book a different place that is more professional and aware you are arriving for the day.","Nice little home tucked off the main streets of Sanur.

That standard I expect from RedDoorz is so low, even for the budget price, that I was pleasantly surprised by this one.
Yes, the room was slightly moldy. The sheets were old and stained, and the bathroom stank and leaked.
Wifi was just in reach of our room if i positioned my laptop correctly.
The pool was tiny and in a dark courtyard, so I didn't use it.

The saving grace and reason I booked an extra night was that it was quite with working air-conditioning and in a great location close to the harbour.
I booked a budget accomodation with low expectations, and they managed to meet those expectations.","I stayed for five nights in this place which is centrally located in Sanur neighborhood. You have quick access to restaurants, cafes, and the beach, and also to the port if you want to go to the islands Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan (buy tickets from the port as it is cheaper than from the travel agencies en route).

My room was pretty decent, with air condition, but the internet didn't reach out to my room so I always had to go and sit on the terrace to have internet access (that was pretty uncomfortable as mosquitoes bite a lot, especially in the evening).

Bathroom was smelly and you had to always close the door if you didn't want the smell to come to your room. Towels and sheets were clean, but looked very old and as they were not washed - they even had old holes, so I stopped using them. Staff is almost like non-existent, you can see them only if you are there by midday.","OK, it's a budget place. I had to move rooms 4 times before I got one with reasonable aircon... The owner said its a hot day.... Yeah, that's why I want aircon. One minute walk to KFC, about 10 to the harbour for penida/gillis.

If they serviced the aircon, everything else is OK for the price. It's down an ally with a yellow painted warung/local shop on the main road. The signs hidden by trees a bit. It's got a blue sliding gate, which is closed at night, but not locked.

It's cheap... Not sure I'd stay there again.","I stayed here at april 2022 and august 2023

for a low cost stay ,this is just enough
The price is cheap so i don’t have a high expectation,just okay for a transit to nusa islands

The room is not very small but not too big,the air conditioner is good,the bathrom is clean and have a good bathing amneties.

The deont office is closed at night so if you already booked but you areived at night,they just left a key in the front office for you to take,but the worker is still around the area if you need something urgent

Pretty near to sanur port👍","Rooms are small but clean....but they dont give soap,even mineral water....free wifi available but speed is very slow....only plus point of the hotel is its location....3/4 min walk from sanur harbour...."

So I returned the car with over half a tank and their policy was just to say thank you for the fuel. Anywhere in North America or Europe getting new rental with empty fuel is unacceptable, but not in this rental agency. So, I would recommend when making an agreement over whatsapp - explicitly require full tank of gas.

The front area provides you with small parking lot and a great small garden.
Each room has complete amenities (tv, bed, AC, Netflix, wifi), I think some corners need a little strengthening or fixing. It has semi outdoor shower with no hot shower, but with Bali’s tropical weather, you will be fine. This is my second time there, previously it was in 2017 or 2018. It has a small pool. You also have your own relaxing corner in front of room with bean bags and hammock.
Overall, my experience is great and the owners are friendly and courteous. I borrowed some cutlery from them for my dinner. I will definitely reconsider again to stay here.","The room is clean, tidy, and well maintained. There’s a TV with Netflix service as well.

However, I wonder why they don’t put room number on the door of each room just like the common hotel/hostel practice.

I was kinda embarrassed. On my first day of staying at the hostel I wrongly opened the next door room. I didn’t know as all doors seem tobe the same color and design.
I hope they will fix the problem.","Hello, I want to share my story and experience during my 2 day stay here.

The atmosphere here is very comfortable, not too noisy, and it is only 1.5 km to Sanur beach.

The bedroom is very comfortable and clean, the bathroom is also clean, there is no warm water here, but the water is very fresh and the swimming pool and yard are very well maintained, clean and comfortable.

Bli Bagus as the owner here is very friendly and kind and very friendly when spoken to.

The only downside is that at night it gets a little dark because the garden and swimming pool lights are being repaired, but everything is still very normal and understandable.

I really recommend you to try staying here if you want to stop in the Sanur area",Really amazing place to stay if you want something simple and relaxing! They have a nice pool where you can sit and relax and have some nice shops nearby.,I have stayed here for 3 nights and this have been a really good choice. It's a small homestay which is nice. There is a lovely pool. The rooms are clean. Sheets and towels are clean. I would definitely stay here again.

Large rooms with a lot of facilities. Not much to do in the close area, but near the harbour.",the owner of the homestay is friendly and kind.  Room facilities are quite complete for the price and hot water is available in the bathroom.  the drawback is the location which enters into a narrow alley and is difficult to reach by car,"Simply wonderful!! The owner Wayan is always there to help you with anything you need. As soon as I told him that I wanted to go to Nusa Lembongan he got me the Ferry ticket cheaper then with other companies and he personally took me to the ferry harbor (For free..I don't think many people are willing to do that).  The room is very nice and clean, with AC, hot water, TV, super fast WiFi. Not all of the room but 3 of them are having kitchen fully equipped and if you miss something you actually just have to ask!

It was comfy and new. Other wise everything was EXTREMELY DIRTY. Toilet had a really bad smell of urine. Enough for not having a shower there for the 2 days we stayed. They didn’t clean our room, it was really disgusting, hair all over the floor, no toilet paper and no soap for your hands… the friends of the owner was talking really loud at night until midnight so I couldn’t sleep. Just don’t go there…","The room was excessively dirty. Despite staying for only 6 hours, it was extremely uncomfortable. The toilet was dirty, the room had a foul odor, and even the pillows smelled unpleasant. Fortunately, we had only booked for one night","Can walk to Sanur port just around 900 metres. Room is old and not quite clean. Bed is very soft, not comfy.","The bed is a little bit cranky, you can not close the room toilet door, the AC is cool, the tv is good, you can get water from water dispenser in the lobby, there is a place to chit chat outside, a lot of good food nearby. Near Sanur beach","This place is located near KFC Sanur, inside a narrow alley (only fit 1 car). What I like about this place is it's tranquillity and friendly staff. The room is clean and it seems that the furniture is new. The room has a TV, AC, and vanity mirror. The bathroom has shampoo and soap, they also provide towels but no other amenities. You can borrow iron if you need one. Breakfast is made by order from 7-10 am. Downside is the wifi is not working and the AC would sometimes feel not cold enough. But I would recommend this place for budget traveler"

The atmosphere is so homey, as if you're visiting a friend's place. My first time having butter coffee and the churros, damn, it's yum! The texture of the dough and the consistency of the sauce is on point. All in affordable price that even schoolies can just drop by to have their lunch here. Music playing on the background isn't too loud, so it's comfortable for friends to just sit together and chat without having to shout at each other along with bristling sound of tree leaves and some chirping birds somewhere that adds a very chill ambience. Figure it would be a nice hideaway for those who just want to sit in the corner alone and read their book or do their work on their laptop. They got a real cute chubby dog called Simba too which I'm sure I can make friends with if I come often enough. They have a sign at the front of their alley. Their place is at the end of the alley and the parking looks like someone's house, but the entrance has a sign so it wouldn't be too difficult to find.","Lovely place to hang out ❤️
Nice service and really tasty local and western food with reasonable prices🌺
As long as you are there must try halı boozy cocktails 🍹",It's a classic and cozy place where you can hear background music and sit on the unrated chair. Whiskey is served with ice cube in the classical coconut bowl and that makes it unique.,"Trah Bali Kopi & Tembakau Gayo can offer a unique and enjoyable experience.
