Spent more than a month there and felt really taken care off.

Any problem I had - and there weren't many - were taken care off immediately. It's clean, beautiful, has a fantastic view over rice fields and is away from roads. So no street noise.

It's a bit on the countryside, with lotsa animals around and even the odd lovely stray cat will visit you in the evening.

I was working during my stay and the Internet was excellent. Very fast, very reliable, even inside the room.

Can wholeheartedly recommend to stay here","We have reached heaven‚Äù! Was our feeling when we arrived at ‚ÄúHidden Jewel‚Äù. What a fantastic place this is. The tranquility, the view, the villa the pool the decor and above all the friendly and helpful staff, not to mention the great cooking skills of the always smiling Anik!
If you can and are allowed to stay here, you have reached the top of the ladder for the holidays! Thanks for everything!","5/5 Stars are completely appropriate!! We just had a perfect 10days-Stay! We had a very warm welcome from Sely, who is like the ‚Äûmanager‚Äú of the villas. She prepared nice breakfast, lunch & dinner at all times we wanted. And it was always delicious!
The whole Team (Sely, Eka, Anik, Wayun and all the drivers we had) were so kind, polite and they took care of our wishes like perfectly. They asked us everyday if w somethings, they did the grocery and bought stuff even when it was late, like medicine or something do drink/eat.
Aswell the roomcleaning was extremely good and nice. Laundry was done in a few hours and trips/tours/scooter were organizated in a few minutes. If something took a little more time we immediately received a whatsapp with all information!
We had no problem with mosquitos or any other insects. Some small cute bugs we‚Äòre our neighbours, but don‚Äòt forget: you‚Äòre next to ricefields and near to jungle! So that‚Äòs just mother nature‚ù§Ô∏è If we would have had a problem with it, Sely or Wayun had directly helped and removed it! But we hadn‚Äòt!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Service 10/10!!!
Thank you all for this relaxing time in the villa! We all would came back again!
We miss you‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è","Beautiful hidden gem surrounded by palmtrees & rice paddies! We absolutely loved our stay in this villa! Sely made our stay of 3 days really like home, she is the best!

I would highly recommend this villa if you come with family, the bedrooms are big and perfect if you have children!
And there a lot of activities close to the villa, like a beautiful white beach, or the water temple !

If you visit the east of bali, go to this villa! You will love it!",Stayed here for a week of working. The arrival itself was great. Putu (the cook) took great care of us and we really felt home from the beginning. The rooms are clean and the pool with the rice field view completes the whole experience in this great villa. The scooters that we rented via Putu were brand new. Definitely will return!
