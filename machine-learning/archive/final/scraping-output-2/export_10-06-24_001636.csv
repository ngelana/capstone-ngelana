I really enjoyed this! It was nice to hit two birds with one stone, seeing the waterfall and rice terraces. Would recommend wearing sandals that are secure to your feet as the last bit of the trail is in shallow water. Super fun and beautiful!","We came here on recommendation by our driver and it definitely is one of the coolest waterfalls I‚Äôve ever seen!! Seems to be off the beaten path a bit, which is what I prefer always. It is about a 25-30 min loop around to 2 amazing waterfalls. You can swim in the second one and then have to walk on water for a little bit to get out. There are steps involved so not the best option for limited mobility. Also would recommend water shoes of some form. We went around 11 and there was hardly anyone there, with plenty of opportunity for photos. There is also a cute stand at the end selling beverages and coconuts, which was perfect. Highly recommend! 20k per person entrance fee.",Very accessible and easy to navigate! You will see 2 beautiful waterfalls and you can swim in the bigger one. The way back is also beautiful. We came in the morning and almost no one was there. The total journey is around 25min and you come back to the same spot you started. Recommend!,"It is a very beautiful place, where with a short walk through the jungle - about 40 minutes - you can see 3 very beautiful waterfalls. Be prepared to walk through water about 40cm deep for a distance of 30-50 meters.","One of the most beautiful waterfall I saw in Bali, also there is a path in the water where you have to go barefoot so I suggest to go in slippers!ü©¥"

The crunch pork skin tastes so good. Also their sausage tastes very similar to one called ‚Äúsoondae‚Äùin south korea. Moreover i got my first time durian there. I thought it would smell bad but it wasnt. it tastes amazing. its like vanilla caramel custard. I can probably say a mother natue‚Äôs cheescake. Thank you Annik :),Very friendly place. The hospitality was just great. We had babi guling what else :) and it was delecious. Fried banana was not on the menue but the owner cooked it for us. She offered a free mango as well but we were already full :D,This is simply the tastiest babi guling in Ubud. A real insider tip and a great flavour experience for the palate every time. I can recommend everyone to give it a try. You have to drive up the hill into the driveway. The family is also so hospitable!,"Best authentic taste, nice and pleasant service, we blessed with a ripped durian fresh from Garden","Great food, great taste.
The staff is very nice!
Very very good and tasty Babi guling!! Went there twice in 3 days :-)"

First she offered a fresh dragon fruit where we did not have to ask for.
Than she surprised us with cookies, maybe to celebrate her birthday today, what she told us a bit later.

The fruit shakes and food were very fresh prepared and absolutely tasty. The prices are very cheap.

We enjoyed a lot. Thank you!","Very good local food, unbeatable price and very welcoming, we came 2 days in a row as you will never find such good food for that price !",Absolutely fantastic!
