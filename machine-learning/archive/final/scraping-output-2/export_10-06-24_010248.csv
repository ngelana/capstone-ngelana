Reservation is needed. We ordered the smoked beef brisket and local pork, both were super good! The cook and waiters were so friendly also, they could joke around with us multiple times.","It's an open-air shack in a residential home with limited seating, so don't expect too much in terms of ambiance that, fortunately, is balanced out with a good selection of pop music from the decades. However, food is exceptionally good especially when you factor in the price. Because of the limited seating, service was attention given and personal. Again, because it's limited seating,  please RSVP before going, or you may be disappointed if there's not enough brisket left for you. Different days also have different specials. We thoroughly enjoyed the pork loin, chicken, and brisket. Food is personally cooked for you a la minute, so expect to wait. Sitting at the counter seats meant we had a great view of the cooking (not for the faint-hearted) and was well entertained by the chef.","So, I finally tried the brisket here, and oh my, it‚Äôs like a flavor explosion in your mouth! Seriously, it‚Äôs so tender and juicy, you won‚Äôt believe it until you try it yourself.

And let‚Äôs talk about the owner - what a gem! Super down-to-earth and friendly, making the whole experience even better. It‚Äôs like eating at a friend‚Äôs place, but with way better brisket.

Definitely swing by if you‚Äôre craving top-notch brisket and some good vibes. Five stars, hands down!","Best barbeque we've ever had. We had the pork brisket (to die for) and the local pork steak with mushroom shimeji and both dishes were exceptional.
Don't expect ambience like a posh restaurant, this is a small local joint that focuses on limited servings. You should call ahead for a reservation.","Suksma BBQ + Love is a delightful culinary gem tucked away in the heart of the city. From the moment you step inside, the ambiance exudes warmth and hospitality. The menu boasts an impressive array of BBQ dishes infused with love and creativity. Each dish is expertly crafted, with a perfect balance of flavors and textures that tantalize the taste buds. The staff is friendly and attentive, adding to the overall dining experience. Whether you're a BBQ enthusiast or simply looking for a memorable dining experience, Suksma BBQ + Love is a must-visit destination."

We had a great stay and recommend it. The property consists of 4 large rooms, built with ample space in between and many outside areas. It is built in a valley towards a river, so all the rooms have a river view. The pool was excellent and the staff super helpful. We'll definitely come back here for an easy weekend getaway.","Calm and serene atmosphere.
Just on the side of a little river.
We got the sapphire suite beneath which the pool is.  It felt like a private pool. Water was warm even at night.
Staff is friendly. Payment, if you insist, they can use card, use travel card. Cash is what they prefer though","Best hidden gem, the staff is very friendly and if you are looking for a great place with a  golden view this is it. Lots of faccilities and a general lounge. The place is big and you have all the privacy needed. Big pool with a great view on the river. I almost did not want expose this gem but i really think it deserves more exposure. The price quallity range is very good.  The place is in the middle of lots of green so expect some close interaction with the nature, please keep that in mind when you book.",The villa was very clean and spacious when we came. During our stay we found a badly injured dog that we had to rescue and the staff was very friendly about it and even watched the dog over night as animal rescue services came the morning after. The staff was great. The area the villa is located in doesn't have much for tourism but if you are looking for a good local experience theres lots of local places to explore! There is also a really good restaurant called Jonkepaon just down the alley that has really nice owners and food as well!,"Such big nice villa. But not as neat as in the photo, especially for the outdoor area, kitchen, living room, ang the pool too. Plus there are so many ants everywhere, but fortunately there is none in the bedrooms. Reasonable price for one whole villa and  for such big capacities."
