The venue was very cozzy for a coffee or a meeting
All the staffs are very friendly and nice
Thank you for the hospitality","The Reserve outlets are never a letdown. Apart from their touristy vibe, you must try their manual filter coffee menus.

This outlet also has a spacious parking lot on the back.","Great experience at this reserve Starbucks! It is so beautiful and a nice cold spot to enjoy a coffee and relax. There is an immersive experience you go through on your own seeing the coffee roasting process and how it comes all the way from the bean. I will say it was a bit confusing which bar we were to get our coffee from, staff forgot one of our order so we had to ask for them to make after some time.","My first time visiting the reserve outlet, quite impressive of the overall design and ambient. Large variety of seating area indoor, outdoor, 2 storeys, friendly service, clean toilets and one can learn about coffee."

Their excuses are always the same, 'other guest are using it, iron is not available'. If you know U have a lot of guests using the iron, U can either add more iron or limit the time for guests to use the iron.

In general it is decent and feels suitable as a simple hotel for a business trip. The only thing I don't like is the balcony door that is unable to be closed tightly, this causes all the noises from the road to pierce through the door.

Our room and bathroom was spotless, towels and bedsheets were clean and smell good, polite and helpful staff. Hotel is at a nice location close to major beaches diner and shopping spots.

Room for improvement: Apparently there were always confusion among staff when I ask them to put my restaurant bills to my room.","Really good service here and the pool was nice. Loved that they had filtered water to refill water bottles in the lobby and rooftop. Wish the buffet breakfast had allergen labels (vegan, gluten free, vegetarian etc) and it would be cool to have plant based milk like oat or soy milk for coffees and cereal.","This is my first experience in bali, that the staff is very not friendly.. especially the front recepcionist  they service us without smile at all. I also requested for the bill but they reject. The receptionist feel like never trained to talk with guests.

The food price is expensive compare to the quality and taste that very poor.

Room feel outdated and the water is weak and oily.
No refrigerator inside the room.

Tv quality is bad, internet sometimes down.
What a joke from santika.

Santika is not recomended.","I stayed at Santika Seminyak Bali for 3 nights for business purposes and was very pleased with my stay. The hotel is comfortable and efficient, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel is located in a quiet area of Seminyak, depending on traffic it's just a short drive to the beach or airport. There are also a number of restaurants and shops within walking distance. The rooms are clean and comfortable, with everything you need for a relaxing stay. The beds are comfortable, the bathroom is complete, and the curtains in the room block out the light well. The hotel has a number of amenities, including a rooftop pool, a spa, and a fitness center. There is also a restaurant on the top that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The staff at Santika Seminyak Bali is very friendly and helpful. They are always willing to go the extra mile to make sure that guests have a great stay. The breakfast buffet is a great way to start the day. There is a wide variety of food to choose from, including both Indonesian and Western options. I can recommend Santika Seminyak Bali to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient hotel in Seminyak. The hotel is perfect for both business and leisure travelers."

The quality of materials used, such as rice, oils, chicken, meat, and spices, are of the finest types and their use is done with very high professionalism.

May God bless them and congratulations to the management of the restaurant with him and others like him,🌹🌺🌷🌸","This place is incredible!!! The atmosphere is beautiful, you have so many seating options. The food however was a bit and miss, we ordered a lot but only really enjoyed two or three dishes. Otherwise the dishes all lacked seasoning and they weren't warm. It was a bit of a let down especially because it was highly recommended.","This is a unique and massive restaurant/lounge.  In addition to the tables at the ground floor, there are lounges upstairs with curtains for privacy.  Check the photos.  You scan a QR code for the menue and use a wireless button if you need a waiter.

I had Biryani lamb, Um Ali for dessert, and tea.  The meat was succulent and fell right off the bones.  The rice was delicious.  Highly recommend you give this restaurant a try and dine in if you can to get the full experience.","Place is nice see. Service is literally like warung service. Nothing compares with the look of the place. Asked the waiter which one of the chicken rice was recommended. Wanted the strongest flavor out of the Mandhi, briyani and kabsah. Ordered kabsah, rice was super dry. Chicken tasted so bland and super small in size :(. Placemat and cutleries came after food was served in the table. Placmat was dirty. Ordered a tea, took forever to come. Really need to improve a lot of things when it comes to create big restaurant like this. Also restroom is wet.","This place was one of the best places in terms of food. It really gave us the experience of eating our home food. Once we found this place via google, we came here EVERY single day, for 6 days straight until we left Indonesia. The only down fall we had, was the inconsistency of the food. We ordered one of the same dish every single day and we noticed every day it was different (specifically the Makhlouba). If they stay consistent I think this would have to be one of the best restaurants we have eaten at in our whole life! The atmosphere is absolutely mind blowing and you feel like you are literally eating somewhere at the UAE."

Very good food for good price, excellent service, waitresses smiling all the time and good live music. Maybe less foods to choose, but for me it’s better, so I chose easily. Guiness is a big plus. I recommend this place.","Starting with a green tea before my food came, I was almost tempted to leave due to how old and stained the mug was that the tea came in. It looked like it had come off a building site from the 90's.

I was so looking forward to fish and chips as my main, but it wasn't great at all. There was way too much batter on the fish alone, never mind all the additional crispy pieces that were sprinkled over the fish and plate. The fish was nothing special. The chips were OK. The peas were on the tiniest of plates and there was only about 30 peas on it.

The service was good.

Wonderful and kind staff, delicious food. I never wanted to leave.
Thanks to the team at Villa Seminyak for a spectacular experience in Bali. Will definitely come back.","I had the most wonderful time at the Villa Seminyak Estate & Spa. I travelled with my partner and sister and we stayed in the Royal Pool Villa and it was perfect. We had breakfast included in our stay and the food selection was fantastic - we also took advantage of room service and all the food was very good. The 2 bedrooms were air conditioned and super clean. The bathrooms and living area are massive. The private pool was such a treat and the outdoor seats are very comfortable. The staff are so lovely and very helpful! The Villa has an exit that comes out right near the Bintang Supermarket, making the location perfect. I could not recommend this Villa enough - you have privacy and peace but are not far from shopping and restaurants. The Lagoon Spa, which is inside the Villa is also 10/10 - I went there every day! We can't wait to come back!","By far the worst place for breakfast buffet. The advertised price outside is 150k, but then almost 200k when you go to pay. That’s for a few hot pans of dry food and chewy bacon. The staff were not replenishing the food as it ran out, and the taste was poor. Also, when I paid they tried to shortchange me and wouldn’t give me the correct change until I showed them with the calculator. Wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone, there are better places to get a nice breakfast for 70k per person across the street.","Loved our villa, but a pedestal fan for the outdoor area would have solved the problem of the heat. More so an overhead fan would be fantastic. Otherwise we loved our stay with helpful & accommodating staff. Beautiful & friendly folk, all of you. You are all good people. Thank you","I can’t say enough nice things about Villa Seminyak Estate and Spa by Astadala. My Mum and I stayed in a lagoon villa each (WOW), and while there were a couple of little things go wrong the staff were straight onto it and beyond helpful.

The pool was brilliant and so long. To step out of your doorway straight into the pool is the best! I’ve been spoilt for life now. 😂

All of the staff are such beautiful people, seriously amazing. Mariani was beyond brilliant! She helped us when our lift to the next hotel in Sanur was booked too early and she changed our checkout time to match the pickup time. She would came and have a chat with us at breakfast every day and whenever she had a spare moment at the reception desk.

The spa treatments are so relaxing and very well priced, indulge, indulge, indulge! 😉

This is seriously the best place I have ever stayed in when coming to Bali. I wish I could take it with me to every location I’m going to.

Oh, and if you’re staying in the lagoon Villa 414, say hi to the gecko 🦎 Toby for me, he lives under the couch. So cute!"

We stayed in the single bedroom villa and loved it!! The room was air conditioned, clean, private and very comfortable. Although the villa is close to traffic, the lush plants, trees and fountains creates a serene and peaceful atmosphere.

The real highlight was how friendly and helpful the staff were. We had their massages, breakfast and free yoga session which were all amazing. All in all, an excellent experience. 💯","We had a 3 bedroom Villa pool estate.
The Villa was beautiful. Each villa is very private fenced with a wall right around covered with palms and very tropical plants and secured by a gate which you can lock.
Gorgeous pool. The living area which includes the kitchen, tv lounge area and dining area are all outside under a gorgeous covered area by the pool with big fans above.
Each bedroom was air conditioned, very icy cool and beautifully decorated.  Each room has their own bathroom which has a bath and an outdoor rain shower. Very awesome.
We had our meals delivered to our room which were very nice. And our cocktails each evening while in the pool.
The staff are very nice and can not do enough for you. The Amala is in a good location with easy access to Seminyak square & village and the beach isn’t too far either. I can’t wait to return.","Located in the heart of Seminyak The Amala is gorgeous. The rooms with either the spa or the pool is very private, well maintained, clean and ver well serviced. The food choices however are limited in the resort but there are plenty of restaurants close by. The staff are exceedingly courteous and efficient. The centre provides very relaxing massages which are a treat for the body. Only regret is that it is a bit too far from any beach.","I’m so glad we got to stay at the Amala over our holiday, from the moment we arrived the staff were all so friendly, helpful and kind. The grounds are beautiful, the villas are beautiful and the rooms  comfy and well air conditioned. They were so beautiful to add an extra touch of a birthday decoration on the bed that was so sweet of them. Never wanted to leave and will definitely stay here again the next time we enjoy Bali. Location was perfect also ! See you next time ","WOW.
We stayed at The Amala as part of our honeymoon in Bali. We originally had a hotel in Seminyak booked which we were a bit unimpressed with on arrival so we quickly looked at alternative hotels and found The Amala. They were very accommodating and managed to book us in for that night, on arrival they had set up a special 'honeymoon' surprise on our bed and the bath was filled with rose petals and looked absolutely beautiful.
The Amala is a real luxury hotel, the staff are extremely friendly and kind and you just feel like you are in a hidden paradise away from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak, it is close to the nicest restaurants and you can either walk or get a grab very easily from the location.
The spa was also amazing, we opted for a massage and it was incredible, we also attended the meditation class and yoga class that are held in the beautiful studio at the hotel.
Although we had a spa villa we chose to spend our time by the pool as it was equally as peaceful and we often had the whole pool to ourselves. We also used the gym facilities; it has a range of cardio equipment and a large selection of dumbbell weights. Most importantly the gym is air-conned.
The rooms are very spacious and have both a morning clean and evening turn down service.
The breakfast selection is wide and they provide a range of different foods; you have 3 courses at breakfast which often we just opted for 2 as it was a lot of food and 2 courses was plenty as all the food was delicious. There is a selection of smoothie bowls, fresh fruits, pastries, eggs ect. always the chance to try something different and there is something for everyone on the menu.

Overall we had an excellent stay and would recommend to any couples visiting Seminyak."

But please bring your own toiletries!
The bathtub was good. But they should check the pipeline, few freshwater moss also came through when I wanted to soak in the 🛁.
There was nothing to watch on the TV too.
Tried to watch movies from my USB, but the option was only for music and pictures 😔","Room OK nice and spacious, bathtub works and running. However the TV,  the one thing children needs most for a holiday is not function. The TV is there but they said it can not be used. The pool is a little bit dirty but who swims anyway. The wall little bit slippery. I do not recommend this place to anyone.","People say you get what you paid for. I have stayed in hotels which is lower in price but with decent services to offer. This is my very first time experiencing a very very bad situation.

1. Room’s floor was so sandy as if people just walked into the room directly from beach. Which means the floor was not swept and mopped before our check in.

2. Toilet was terrible! I have never seen anything like this with any of my stays before. Dusty, Sandy, Hairs everywhere and even toothpaste stain on the floor and bathtub!

3. Breakfast is from 8am-11am. But even if you reach at 8.3am, food will be very very less and they don’t care to top up.

4. The towels are so dirty with Stains everywhere. We requested to get it changed.

5. No lift in the hotel. Total of 3 storeys and our room was at the 3rd floor. When we are ready to go out the room can’t be locked so we have to go down the stairs to get a new card from the reception and come up again. Also happens again when we can’t unlock the door with the new card given. So it’s going up and down again and again.

6. Too dark  in the room! You will need to leave the curtains open in order for you to get dressed and be ready!

7. Super noisy. You can hear people walking and talking even from the lower floor.

I would never recommend this place to anyone. I read reviews in Agoda before booking and all was good. Only to realise Agoda never reflect bad reviews. When I realised how bad the hotel room is, my husband checked google reviews to be sure. So next time please check Google review as partners might choose to hide some of the bad reviews to maintain reputation.","Disgusting Rat infested Hotel- could hear them running around in the roof & squealing

Cheap, but after staying there I can see why. Staff are dry, no customer service, looks like they hate their jobs

Dont waste your money here. So many better places to stay in beautiful Bali

The decent thing about it was the pub next door!",Old hotel. A bit too dark in the room but spacious and large bathroom. Comfy bed but thin wall so you can hear people from upstairs - i was in the second floor. Also there are ants near the tv and moldy scent when i entered the room. Also you can hear other guests from the balcony downstairs since its not a big property. Plenty of other placed better than this tbh.

We also ordered a cappuccino each but left the restaurant still hungry.

Room furnishings a little dated but cleanliness is well maintained. We loved the private pool! Complimentary fruits and water and a big fridge is a plus as well. Nice walkways decorated with plants,"Lovely villas, great customer service. The air conditioning was top notch. The pool was clean.
The included breakfast was delicious !!
It is half indoor/half outdoor and that is just spectacular. The bathroom also connects outside to the pool area and it was insanely cool. So you can swim and then dont have to walk all soaking wet through the bedroom, you can just directly go into the bathroom.
It had a shower and a bathtub.
The attached Warung has the best food I got in my time in Bali. Get the spring rolls with peanut sauce you won't regret it.
We got a massage and the ladies were lovely and they didn't expect a tip but we tipped them anyway.
When: May 2023","Everything was amazing. The location was perfect - close enough to get a great sense of Bali, but far our enough away to not be in the thick of it.
The villas were beautiful, quiet and exceptionally clean. Very well thought out with everything you would need and want. The beds and pillows were so comfortable and the aircon worked great!
The greatest part though, was the staff. They were so helpful and so friendly and made us feel at home. They greeted us with a smile everyday and no request was too difficult for them. We want to come back ASAP!
Linda & Kez :)","We stayed a week from Australia in the 1 bedroom villa.

My honest review of the villa is, it’s nice but the bathroom seemed to smell bad every day. There is a lock from the bedroom to the bathroom but there’s no lock from outside into the bathroom which is where the safe box is. There is a lot of mosquitoes despite them providing a coil to burn they still seem to sneak into the bedroom. I’m a light sleeper and the street traffic is very loud and constant. Wouldn’t be ideal for a light sleeper like me.

Our stay included the spa package which was a bit all over the place. They tell you that you have to pre-book as their massage workers are between the other Samaja Villas. This made it hard to get our daily massage as we usually had day trips planned and couldn’t commit to an exact time. Sometimes the massages weren’t even the full 60 minutes.

Our stay also included breakfast - this was also a bit over the place as most the time we initiated putting in our breakfast order, they didn’t even ask or give us breakfast on our last morning.

Overall though, the staff are lovely and the villa is quite nice. Probably less ideal for a long stay - we loved the fishes and the turtle!","Could not fault a thing. Villa was amazing, good aircon and the pool was phenomenal. We did not want to leave! The staff were absolutely beautiful and the food and cocktails were amazing too!
We did not want to leave :(
We will be back. So so happy with our stay!!"

Breakfasts were lovely & very tasty, we had them delivered to villa each morning. Room service outstanding and very affordable. The only 1 thing the room needed was somewhere to dry bathers, or somewhere to hang them to dry. It was my Birthday while staying my husband organised a flower bath with staff and decorations in villa, attention to detail is outstanding. Bed super comfortable. Great size fridge in villa that was super cold for our drinks. Great location with great eateries surrounding the villa. Highly recommend Lasanti villas.","I think the price was excellent hence we booked this place. It is a bit old but well kept.

The bed was super comfortable and the room very spacious.

Aircon strong enough to cool the room fast and maintain it over night.

Breakfast is served directly to the room, you just have to inform them the day before. Good options but not huge spread (their coffee could be much better).

Easy check-in and out. Friendly staff, no issues","Plus point : comfy bed, good bath tub. Spacious unit. Pool is standard, they only turned the water circulation on the morning.
Location ok near main road.
Need improvement :
Facility should be better for the price. After it rained, the walkway from front door to our villa got flooded so we're wet until near ankle height. Also around the villa stair. The next day I noticed that there's actually a floor drain on that area, means the management should be able to handle such situation.
Other thing to mention, in one of the room the rain water got inside from below the door (photo attached). Although the cleaning device handled it quickly, it annoyed us.. How if we put our stuffs on the floor? They'd be all wet.
Drinking water came in reusable bottles, which caps are dirty in the inside like never been washed (see photo). Please, we pay such a price.. Why don't just provide us with bottled water that can be trusted.
Floor drain on shower was clogged.
Breakfast was so so, everything was too salty.
Overall not satisfied, not worth the price we paid.",We stayed here for the first half of our Honeymoon and absolutely loved the experience. Very special and the staff were so lovely,"We stayed here for nearly a week,
Was a great stay, centre of everything so location is really convenient.

The food was kind of average. We organised breakfast there for the whole stay but after the first order we didn’t re organise it.

The people that work there are also very nice, pleasure to deal with them. Very professional and kind people.

The rooms were average, was clean and got cleaned everyday, but the bugs everyday in the shower and bathroom area were a bit of a bummer.

Every morning there were at least 10 flies and 20 waiting to have a party with us in the bathroom.

Wasn’t the best villa, but wasn’t the worst either,
I probably wouldn’t stay again, but it still was a fine stay."

Bed is comfortable.  Staff is friendly.,"Friendly staff, nice & clean pool. Location is ok, down an alley way. There is near by laundry service and a Warung like a two minute walk. Hotel has great water pressure!!","Great for value.
Big pool nice room and helpful staff","Overall a good place to stay. AC worked well. TV in the room. Shower pressure was good. Beds were comfy. Location is central to many restaurants and bars. Rooms are spacious. Pool is very big and clean. Shame the sun doesn’t really reach the sun beds during the day but not the hotels fault.
Downsides was the hot water was temperamental. Sometimes you couldn’t have a hot shower.
Bad small from the bathroom at times. Smelled like drains
WI-FI wasn’t the best at times
Stains on the bedsheets when we arrived","I booked this during one of the local OTA's flash sale. So I got it for super affordable price. Even if i had to pay more, I'd say this accommodation offers great value for money. The rooms are well equipped and clean, for the price range. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great place at a great location (especially if you have your own scooter, tho car parking is available)."

The hotel offers colonial era service, oppressing Asians. Indians and dogs are not allowed. Most racist hotel possible. My first trip with my kids and my in-laws but because of the stay i would never want an Indian to stay at this hotel. I would never prefer to come back to Bali again.
As soon as we enter the staff asked us to leave and stay somewhere else despite charging 100% advance payment because we were Indians. After requesting for half an hour, staff understood their mistake and allowed us to stay. Then when we reached our room, there was no extra bed, inspite of informing the hotel continously for 2 weeks that i have 2 kids, i need extra bed. The night i had to sleep on the floor without pillow, blanket and sheets. The next day and the day after, while having brrakfast, staffs continously informed us that we are having free food. Even if you are ready to pay still they embarrassed me in front of my whole family and other guests.
They treat other nationality people very well and politely but Indians are treated and being conversateed like dogs.
I have registered the complaint to the Indian Embassy to try and inform Indians not to visit the hotel or book a stay there.
Rooms are not that great. All beddings and shower towels are smelly.
The treatment was such that, the staff made me cry out of embarrassment in front of my kids and everyone.
I beg all my Indian fellows to avoid the hotel if they want to save themselves from the embarrassment and racism.
Zero star reviews.
NOTE: All Indians please avoid the place if you do not wish to re-live colonial era situation. Unwelcoming and unfriendly place.","We were not comfortable in this hotel. Air-con didnt work so asked to be moved. They tried to say that my daughter and I would have to share a bed in the new room WTH the place was half empty so declined and got a room with 2 beds which is what I had booked.  Bugs in the bed ( both rooms)and on bedside table if you leave your drink alone for a few mins bugs jump into it.The aircon even in 2nd room was weak but slightly better.The shower head is old with a hard force it hurt  your skin no adjustment. The yellow towels were thin and extremely old.First night I asked for a pool towel to swim at 7.30pm but the rude staff( man) said pool was closed, I reminded him that  the form I had signed said 8pm so he begrudgingly gave me a towel,  all of the  other staff were very nice. Soundproof walls is not true as you could here EVERYTHING.  We regretted leaving our last hotel which was amazing. The only 3 things i was happy with  were pool, food we ordered and they let us check in at 12.30 instead of 2pm.","Rooms are spacious, clean and have decent amenities. Staff cleaned the room daily. Well maintained building and pools. Limited breakfast and food option (fruit juice or slices fruits + toast/egg potato/nasi goreng/mie goreng). Surprisingly calm and quiet in a rather central area of Seminyak. Very peacefull ambience. Wifi works well in the room and the common area (lobby and bar). Friendly and helpfull staff.","I was pretty overwhelmed with how many different hotel options there were in Seminyak, and on a whim I choose Kubu Cempaka. The second I arrived I knew I made a great choice. The hotel is located on a quiet street that is about a five minute walk from the main road full of spas, restaurants, and shops. The hotel itself was very clean, modern, and so beautiful and peaceful while still being so close to all of the action. The pool was so lovely with the heat and the food at the restaurant was very fairly priced and very tasty. The staff were all very kind and friendly. I am so happy I ended up staying here and would happily stay here again if I were ever back in Seminyak!","Nice and clean place, close to the different places as: restaurants, small shops etc. Definitely the price corresponds to quality 👍"

We were so well looked after for our wedding anniversary this was an experience we will never forget. Breakfast at the cafe was the best breakfast I have had on any visit to bali. The villa was sensational everything we needed and so clean. Will definitely stay again.,"Overall really enjoyed my stay here for 5 nights.

Pros: Very spacious, quiet and private, friendly and helpful staff, large pool, Netflix, chilled filtered water cooler in kitchen to fill your bottle (better for the environment) I wish all hotels had this.

Cons: Needs some slight maintenance although it does look like the photos online it needs some minor work. Bathroom window kept banging in the wind etc also small lizards in the room etc but neither of these bothered me too much.

Really relaxing and overall would recommend and happily return.","Great service, the one bedroom villa is so spacious and comfortable. The stuff is super friendly. They gave us a complimentary cake for our honeymoon.
Also, breakfast is incredible!","Very friendly place, good breakfast and local to everything. I must add that it is a very relaxed chilled place which considering seminyak is very busy this is about 15 minute walk from the beach but I think is perfect to be out of the thick of it, to add relaxation.  Excellent job will be back oh and David says thanks for his very tasty creamy 🍄 for breakfast.  Thanks guy's we will be back. All the best David and Liza villa 7.","Rather disappointed with my stay here. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was rather outdated and under equipped. We were charged to order an extra 1 egg at breakfast, disappointing. Whilst we also informed the waiter of our order and it was repeated back to us, mistakes were continually made. Seems like they are trying to cut costs to save money but when you are paying a high rate at a so called 5 star hotel, what you expect and what you are delivered don’t match up. Whilst staying around the corner at a 4 star hotel, I found the service, the room and the restaurant to be of a much higher standard. This resort should be no more than 4 stars and that being generous.

Time for a review of service and improvement is definitely needed."

The villa charges for anything you leave out of place, they also charge for bed linen for any foot marks , syrup or ink. If you get sick, be careful with the bedding you may not feel as comfortable as you should during your holiday.  Everything is charged extra at check out time!
