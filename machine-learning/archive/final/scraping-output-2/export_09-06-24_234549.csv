The location is slightly more remote than other places in the Ubud area, which is exactly what we were looking for. A lovely, romantic place with a great view at the jungle. The staff is the nicest we've ever met, always helpful, always smiling. The room is everything you need, well-maintained and comfortable. Finally, with the breakfasts being our favourites, I can say that everything we've eaten here was delicious.","Great hotel with an amazing service! It is extremely isolated, which guarantees you will not be disturbed by cars or similar noises. However, this also means you will not find any restaurants or shops near by. I really recommend the massage they do in your room!","Bit off the old beaten track, but what a wonder. Its still only a short bike/taxi driver away from the busy tourist streets of ubud and even closer to rice paddies. The staff are all lovely and polite people trying to do what they can for you every day. The rooms are really good, with great views and private spaces. The pool, just looks so serine, peaceful and beautiful. Has its charm at different times of the day. We had food brought to our room every night after requesting through WhatsApp with no problem at all.

Only downsides I would say is that you can hear people in the room next to you quite easily as it's all thin wooden paneling. Maybe also that you can't always get a taxi as a little bit further out","This is a phenomenal place to stay for a honeymoon. Staff is very kind and helpful. Meals are very tasty and big. Prices are affordable. Apartments are very clean, nice swimming pool with great view.
Only one thing, which hotel can improve: walls between apartments are very thin and you can hear everything from other apartments.","This place is the perfect romantic getaway , pool is amazing, food was super yummy breakfast and dinner. Room was clean , although no AC only ceiling fan , and terrace balcony had no barrier and since its hot and no AC we left it open 24/7 therefore alot of insects kept coming to our room , gecko was all around , but its to be expected from a place in middle of a forest , i recommend the place 100% you wont regret it ; location although is very far from ubud center , far from everything actually but worth it"

We stayed 2 weeks in Oct. '22.  It rained every day, mostly all day.  This place is outside of Ubud by a long winding rural road.  To go anywhere a vehicle is needed.  The family was just darling.  For a very low cost, lower than cooking for myself, they fed us 3 meals a day delivered to our rooms.  The food is ~80% organic and grown by them.  They accommodated my gluten free diet and provided for our every need.  It was wonderfully quiet with sounds of nature.  The premises is masterfully planned and landscaped jungle.  They are constantly maintaining it.  They have 3 rental units, separate cottages with hot showers, good wifi, clean, comfortable beds, ceiling fans.  The shared kitchen is in a tiny hut, with small fridge, 2-burner gas stove and sink.  The cottages are set quite a distance from their house along a narrow stepping stone path.  The stones are covered with moss and very slippery in wet season.  Wear  shoes with good treads!  We had 2 falls, one with injury as the shoe soles were worn smooth.  They gave me a custom cooking class and sharpened my knife!  Our total living expenses including meals and rides was lower than any other arrangements we found in Bali.  If you crave peace and quiet in nature with no effort to get meals, this is the place!",Country side atmosphere.  close to several tourist attractions in Ubud,"This place is your dream come true if you:
1) love to be in (beautiful) nature
2) want to disconnect from stressful modern life
3) want to experience Balinese culture

The attentiveness with which the host Dewa and his whole family take care of you is beyond belief. 5 star hospitality that you can feel - they pay attention to your needs and quietly provide accordingly without taking credit. All this is on top of the excellent accommodation: a very adequate and cozy house with a fantastic huge garden and a dreamy gazebo as dining area. You will be surrounded by beautiful nature at all times. The air here is probably the freshest I have ever breathed.

You might think that the area is a bit out of the way but we found it to be not the case. To us it is a better base to explore Ubud than the touristy and crowded city centre both in terms of travel time to attractions and cost of living saved. It's close to Mount Batur, the famous water temple, the Tegallalang rice terrace, etc. Our 3 meals are taken care of by Dewa's family (free breakfast, lunch and dinner on request at low cost and good value) during our entire stay. No fuss, no time wasted. There is more to praise but I'll leave you to discover the magic.","Really amazing people. Girlfriend and I were in a tour with scooter through the whole Bali and this was our last stop before going to south of island. Whole family is involved in guesting you, even grandmother and granddaughter etc. We were in many apartments and rooms during our several months stay and I can say they are very very good people in the bottom of their souls. Breakfast was very big and great. They will come and see several times if you need anything. There are two big rooms in the whole area so it's quiet and no traffic, yelling, screaming, loud talk etc. from other tourists.
Price for the night is very underrated for the quality that gives. Rooms are new, only one year.
Highly recommended !","We stayed at Dewa house for a few nights and it was the best time we spent in Bali. The room is located in peaceful area with green surroundings and you can't hear any traffic noise. It is also perfect location for doing yoga or meditation because you have private place and all you can hear is only sound of nature. Dewa and his family is so lovely and hospitable, they do everything for well being of the guests. You can rent a motorbike with them, get a taxi from/to the airport, book a hiking tours, eat fruits from their garden and you can also have lunch or dinner in their guesthouse (very cheap and delicious food, also available vegetarian options). We joined with family to the traditional ceramonies and we learned a lot about Balinese customs. Living with this family was genuine experience, we will go back there before we will leave the island. I really recommend staying with Dewa if you love nature, non tourist place and if you want spend nice time with Balinese family."

De Ade is an amazing host and has a heart of gold.
The locals absolutely spoilt us with their hospitality and generosity.
We will definitely be back and hopefully soon.
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts üôè","We were so lucky to spend a week at this beautiful location with the beautiful, kind, generous folks who took care of us! We were able to relax here, enjoy the sites of Ubud and other parts of Bali. Made and his drivers, Gede and Gede, planned a wonderful holiday for we three sisters, even including a birthday party for one of us! We enjoyed his wife‚Äôs cooking for breakfast and several dinners. We wanted for nothing!! A few highlights:  sunrise at top of a volcano, massages at the house, coffee at the plantation, beautiful temples and a waterfall. Don‚Äôt miss an opportunity to stay here.","Staying here was a real treat with the very warm and friendly staff who provided absolutely fantastic service. There was a warm breakfast cooked in the villa every morning (at whatever time you wish) and Made the manager/private driver gave really good recommendations for food and things to do. He also gave us some insight into village living in Ubud, regaling us with recounts of the ceremonies rituals and simple day to day living experiences. The staff were also very accommodating with special requests and such.

The private pool is kept really clean with minimal chemicals and it's of a decent enough size for 4 people. Beds were more than comfortable (1 king and 1 double bed) and the air conditioning and fan were adequate in keeping the villa at a nice temperature. The main toilet with a shower is pretty big and well ventilated and there is another toilet just next to the kitchen.

Location wise, it's a 20min drive to Ubud town centre and it's fairly isolated - you won't be wandering around at night!

All in all, if you want some top notch service during your stay in Ubud, and you want some peace and quiet (though my friend was ready to strangle the roosters), away from the hustle and bustle of city life, Merta House is the place for you!",Very accommodating away from the hustle and bustle of ubud but not too far ‚Ä¶ about 10/15 mins from tegalalang real balinese experience
