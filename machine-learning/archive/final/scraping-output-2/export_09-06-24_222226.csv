You can choose several types of fish inside a box filled with ice, such as grouper, pomfret or parrot fish as well as shrimp and squid. Grilled seafood served with water spinach accompanied by very spicy chili sauce. Prices were quite reasonable","Local price as they say. 45k for grilled whole fish, enough for one person, which is really cheaper than in a Bule tourist restaurant !!!","We went there in the evening close to sunset as it was near to our hotel. The place is beautiful and price is reasonable. However, the food is horrible. The fried squid is so hard it hurts your tongue and the water spinach has some weird coconut taste in it. The dishes were served lukewarm. Fish was fresh but tasteless. Do not recommend it.","Family friendly, cheap, fast and beautiful beach to spend your time off.

When we reached, the place was quiet. Eventually we realised there's hardly anyone staying at the resort, which scares us a little bit. I think there's only like 2-3 other families/groups around? üòÇ

To be honest, it doesn't really feel like a resort. The place (external surroundings) is pretty, but the rooms are old and not well-maintained. Floor is rather dusty (as Asians I do not fancy this as it feels like I need to wear shoes inside), some of the lights are not working (can't light up), there's only 2 charging ports, water flowing through the shower head is slow, no toothbrush and toothpaste provided as well ...

The view in the evening is great though, from the beach. And the staffs are really polite, nice and helpful. I think if the management of the place improve, this would be a really good place to stay. Otherwise, at this point of time, I don't think I'll go back again. I'm only giving 2 stars (the only thing I like) for the nice staffs working here, as well as the evening view from the beach.","I can‚Äôt think that anyone returns to this hotel. It is simply poor.

The room had no hot water, the toilet didn‚Äôt flush properly. Absolutely no Wi-Fi coverage in the rooms away from reception. Old worn towels. Dirty coffee cups on arrival. Old dated furniture. Dirty lampshades. TV from the 1980s. Lock on the door wasn‚Äôt particularly great with signs of previous forced entry. Toilet and bath had permanent imbedded stains. Generally dirty worn out rooms which need a complete overhaul. Pool bar was derelict. Pool area generally wasn‚Äôt that appealing.

This hotel is also in a poor location, nothing noteworthy in walking distance e.g. bars and restaurants. Don‚Äôt be fooled by Google maps, a lot of things have closed down.

Reception staff weren‚Äôt friendly but the other staff were. Which is a shame because the lack of investment in this place isn‚Äôt their fault.

I can‚Äôt recommend this place and certainly wouldn‚Äôt stay again. Simply not good enough even if you halve the price.","The hotel location is very good since Its just by the beach. However the room has many problems. Some of the rooms has no working warm water. Ants and mosquitos are within some of the rooms the light is dim and not bright. The lighting outside of the room is minimal. Air conditioning works but is noisy. Toilet seat leak water too. So if youre on a budget in in need for a hotel at Lovina, this could still be a place to stay but o wont recommend a long stay","Most stupid and clueless hotel I have ever spend my night in. We book the room through online but when we arrived at the lobby, the owner told us they already cancel the contract with the online application and all other Bali hotel did the same thing, but when we live in other next hotel in the next night, there is no such thing. Basically a pure scam. The room is messy, toilet pump is not usable and the room cannot be locked from inside or outside. Also there is no receptionist at the counter to serve the guest during the night. Please stay away from here.",Came here for business trip and met with friendly staffs. The room feels classic yet wonderful. The beach atmosphere gives relaxing mind and body. The hotel is quiet near with Lovina tourism spot and with the other store or other activities.

PROS  Comfortable bed, large swimming pool, view, close to the beach
CONS: Only basic cleaning like sweeping the floor and changing bed done. Very dirty in the bathroom corners, broken, shower, and warer pressure not constant,
cobwebs all around the bedroom ceiling and only removed when asked. Bed headboard thick with dust as if never cleaned. Downstairs cushions and day beds need washing with stains on them. Upstairs outdoor chair rusting with no cushion to sit on, looks like should have and missing. AC downstairs not working for whole stay even though informed and told it would be done the next day. It wasn't (we stayed 2 weeks), there was no follow-up. They did ask if we wanted to move, but as didn't really use downstairs and liked been the end, so we did not. The kitchen is not really set up like an apartment. Some more options for cooking would have been great, along with no towel to dry items. 2 small waterbottles given when cleaning the room. It is not very sustainable, and I would prefer to see a gallon in the unit like most places now or reusable glass. In the description, it mentioned power near the bed. By that, they mean on the other side of the room.
Rooms get nosies from the main road, which can be an issue for light sleepers.
Staff were not really friendly interactions we had. Place has potential. However, management or owner need to focus on maintenance and attention to detail cleaning training the staff better, or checking on them as this really does the property down.","This is a great little space to stay in Lovina

The bed linen is beautiful and fresh.
The pool is very clean and a good temperature, being a little in the shade is also very good.
Comfortable upstairs bedroom was quiet, don't worry about the noise from the road, no window facing that way so it's very quiet.
Staff were helpful with breakfast and a local scooter.
They kept their staff employed during the pandemic, bless them. Which also means the property was well maintained.
If we come back to lovina, we will stay here again.","Love the desain of the room plus langsung menghadap swimming pool and beach, second floor - bed nya comfort, shower room nya specious. Harganya oke","This place when I visited had only recently opened. The hospitality shown, the warm welcome and clear communication was great. The studio apartments are quite honestly stunning. Overlooking directly to the ocean. Private sun longer, with a shared pool with the other private apartments.

I couldn't ask for more from the accommodation. Lovina was so much quieter than the south of the island.

Managed to get a boat from the beach in front of the hotel to view dolphins.

And eating at their restaurant only a short walk away is a must, and the shop has some great quality products.",Highly recommend this place. 2 floor apartment style with pool on the beach in fantastic location. Very clean and great amenities. Excellent value for money.

This place is truly a hidden gem. The staff is incredibly helpful and so sweet, the rooms were so clean and comfortable. The pool was perfect temperature, the view was unreal and the breakfast was perfect. I am so sad to leave. One of my favorite beach hotels I have ever been to. Thank you so much! We will certainly be back!","My girlfriend and I spent a few days here and have nothing but good things to say! From the moment one steps into Lilin Lovina Beach Hotel, they are embraced by tranquility and the promise of a serene retreat in the heart of enchanting Lovina Beach. The hotel‚Äôs prime location, right on the beach, offers guests the luxury of waking up to the gentle symphony of waves and witnessing the sky painted in myriad colors during sunset.

The true gems of this place are the staff, whose warm smiles and unparalleled service enrich the overall experience. Dewi, Ferry, and others went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect, making us feel valued and well taken care of with their attention to detail and friendly demeanor.

The beautifully maintained plunge pools offer a refreshing sanctuary, allowing guests to unwind in ultimate comfort, soak in serenity, and escape the hustle and bustle of life.

Lilin Lovina Beach is a treasure trove where beauty, luxury, and hospitality intertwine, making it a highly recommended destination for anyone seeking a peaceful and luxurious retreat.","This would have to be the worst hotel we have ever stayed in, in Bali. (Approx 11 trips) the pool was empty, dirty and gross. The beach was so disgusting!!! So much rubbish on beach wouldn't even go on it. Glass in the tiny plunge pool. No privacy. Lawn areas were non-existent or in bad shape. Food not available you have to go to town. Bar area was a joke. Can't comment on breakfast, we checked out 30 minutes after checking in, we couldn't stay there.
Staff member was lovely.","Lovely place! We really enjoyed our 3 days stay at this hotel. All the staffs are so friendly and helpful. Our room was clean, AC & fridge were really cold, water heater also works well. Breakfast was so-so but enough to make us full (didn‚Äôt even expect to get a breakfast given the price of our room, so any breakfast at all is already good).

The place is really worth every penny we spent! At this price we got a beach front room, with all the facilities mentioned above and our own private plunge pool.

They also helped arrange a dolphin viewing & snorkeling trip for us at a reasonable price.  We got to see the dolphins with a beautiful sunrise in the background & snorkeled around Taman Laut. We also went to Aling2 Waterfall which was 20 minutes car drive from the hotel and did jumps & water slide. Thank you for making our stay super memorable & homey! We‚Äôd love to come back again next time!","This is my second time at the hotel the first time was before covid .
It‚Äôs lovely to have a private small villa with own pool and a view directly on the sea .
For sure there is a lot of room of improvements to do about the access itself but it has the potential to be one of the best in lovina .
We will Defo will be back !! Keep improving"

To begin with, the manager of the dolphin beach Bali apartments booked for us a dolphins watching tour as we were staying there for few nights, which was priced at 500k IDR for both of us. We were instructed to be at the reception by 6 am. However, upon arrival, we encountered a man who directed us to the boat number 89. Once on board, the captain immediately tried to convince us to book a private trip, It was perplexing that he insisted on a private trip when we were the only two participants present.
During the snorkeling excursion, I unfortunately lost my snorkel. The captain of the boat immediately demanded that I have to pay 1 million rupiah or be left stranded in the middle of the sea. Feeling coerced, I reluctantly agreed to pay upon our return to shore. This incident alone was distressing, but what followed was even more alarming.
After a heated argument, the captain threatened physical violence and claimed that he could do to me whatever he pleased as it was his country. I promptly reported this incident to the hotel, expecting a swift and appropriate response. However, to my dismay, the hotel staff showed no concern or willingness to address the situation. Instead, they sent an individual named Rocky, who falsely represented himself as the leader of the boat's organisation, to handle the matter.
At night, we noticed that Rocky was wearing the hotel‚Äôs security uniform. This raised suspicions about the hotel's involvement and the true nature of his role.
Seeking clarification, I approached other boat captains on the beach the next day and discovered that Rocky was merely an alcoholic security personnel with no authority over the private boat operations. This revelation only deepened our sense of unease and insecurity.
Feeling utterly unsafe and disturbed by the entire ordeal, we made the decision to cut short our stay and checked out of the hotel, even though we had initially planned to stay for another night. The events that transpired left me with a profound lack of trust in the hotel and its staff.
I implore you to thoroughly investigate the incidents I have described and take appropriate action to rectify the situation. It is crucial that your hotel prioritises the safety and well-being of its guests, and such distressing occurrences should never be allowed to transpire. I sincerely hope that you will address these concerns with the seriousness they deserve, and take measures to prevent any similar incidents from happening in the future.",Fantastic sunrise view and dolphin tour. The location and scenery was awesome. Morning breakfast while swimming.,"Fabulous beachfront place to relax on the balcony and watch the boats, fishermen and locals go about their daily life or walk on the beach. The apartment was huge and very clean, the breakfasts delicious and big portions. Staff are super helpful and friendly; just ask for anything you need and they assist with a smile. We were dropped into central Lovina and picked up several times, set up with extra beds in the apartment and helped to get an early morning boat to chase dolphins (saw plenty!) as well as rent motorcycles. So glad I‚Äôve found somewhere in Lovina to return to. Thanks for a great stay üôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ","Beautiful seaside location, breathtaking sunsets. Huge appartment, and very clean. Staff has invented the famous Balinese smile, so helpful, even fabricated beautiful Balinese kite with our boys, tought them to fly it, and eventually gave it to them as a parting gift. Good hot/cold setting of shower needs some patience‚Ä¶","Great place to stay on the north coast of Bali,  after a fascinating drive from Ubud though the centre of the island to Lovina. Dolphin Beach is a small boutique hotel right on the beach with great personal service, good breakfast and a lovely pool. We had a fabulous upstairs room looking over the sea and gardens, well furnished and good cooking facilities. There were not many warungs open nearby so it was convenient for us to cook our own evening meals. The hotel's guest vehicle was not operating but we called a local taxi to go exploring the market and village"

She then saw us talking to him and walked over and started getting really angry. When we finally agreed on the room she told us to be out by 9am??? When check out was 12pm.
