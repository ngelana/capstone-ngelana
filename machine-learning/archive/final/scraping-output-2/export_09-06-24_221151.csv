The hotel has a beautiful pool area surrounded by lush gardens with wonderful views of Bali sea. The place is perfect for a relaxing holiday but could also serve as an excellent base for exploring northern Bali. The staff were incredibly welcoming and helped to organize day trips to Amed, Batur, Karangasem etc. The on-site restaurant was delicious and offered a diverse selection of dishes at reasonable prices. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to unwind and enjoy the adventure of nearby locations.","Driving from Amed to Lovina and needed somewhere to stop for a drink. The staff are super friendly and the food and drink spot on. We didn't stay the night but would loved to come back on night! The pool and views are super pretty, it's quite and relaxing. Definitely a great place to stop.","We really enjoyed our stay. We had a huge room with our own separate room for clothes  Our big Terace was just a few meters away from the ocean/beach. Also, the pool was  just 5 steps away. The ocean is wonderful, We snorkeling above koralls and plenty of colorful fishes. The friendly owner was very supportive.","Our room had 3 cockroaches coming in the bathroom in 3 days. Sadly there was no other room for us due to the location being fully booked; that‚Äôs no problem ofcourse. Staff offered to clean the room up and remove the roaches. They did, but left two dead cockroaches on the floor. Bit nasty. Food takes a long time to be prepared and is not all served at the same time. Food is in general low quality.","A couple friends and me stayed here for some relaxation time during the middle of our stay in Bali and had a great time. The place was wonderful, the ocean view from the pool was perfect. The staff were all very kind and helpful, special shout out to Martina who was our favourite! Highly recommend this place."

The resort area is very spacious in the middle of coconut trees and lush nature with a beautiful yoga space overlooking the ocean. We had one of the upstairs rooms with beautiful view and had all windows open at night to sleep with the ocean sounds. The food was really amazing, cooked by the lovely Balinese staff. They are like a family and offer big smiles to all guests. For sure recommended for anyone who likes to stay in a more quiet area in North Bali.",Tamina and the Prana Veda staff are incredible. I did the healing energy retreat and truly feel reborn. This place is so magical. ‚ú®,"I spent the Energy and Healing Week at Prana Veda. It's a very relaxing, spacious and beautiful place right at the beach. The food is delicious, the massages very well done and the staff is super friendly. The yoga and also meditation classes were adapted to all levels which for me as a beginner was important and helpful. Would definitely recommend this place!","I really enjoyed the stay here. It is a beautiful resort, indulged into a beautiful garden, directly at the ocean, with a nice pool, amazing spots to relax and recharge, listening to the ocean waves and enjoy the delicious and with a lot of love cooked food.
It is a hidden gem, with so much love for the little details, excellent rooms and food, and the staff was always helpful and very friendly and carrying.
I had an amazing room on the second floor with a fantastic view over the garden and ocean. The staff organized everything to our wishes and helped us with all our requests (i.e. organizing a cooking class).
I have to point out that the food here is really great and I loved the vegan options (please try the red bean hummus it is so yummy).
This resort is a beautiful gem, and you can feel how much heart energy is put in here, so that you can really feel home, relax, and find back to yourself.","Prana Veda is a beautiful place in the North of Bali where you can completely switch off and be immersed in nature. The light breeze off the ocean makes the temperature much nicer than other parts of Bali, like Canggu, so that you can actually enjoy it the whole day. Waking up to the sound of the waves gives you an instant feeling of relaxation. There‚Äôs a beautiful yoga Shala overlooking the ocean and two pools to enjoy. The building style is very open, so you can enjoy the breeze inside of the room as well and is great for a community feel and I imagine the retreats here would leave you feeling relaxed and recharged."

The staff were also wonderful and the food was delicious. Unfortunately though there is a problem with rats. They say to put food into plastic containers that they provide, but unfortunately they don‚Äôt also say to put many other things like anything made of silicone, and hand creams, face creams, medicines, and many other things that rats like to have a nibble at. I returned to my room one evening to find that a rat had eaten its way through all my luggage, including my toiletry bag, and it had been on my bed, I also found rat faeces in my suitcase. It was disgusting. The staff were very helpful and changed my sheets, disinfected my room, and actually caught the rat in a trap. However I would like to have been warned ahead of time that there might be this problem so that I could zip all my bags up and prevent rats from going through all my things.","Beautiful spot with unbeliavable combination of nature, garden, ocean and spacious buildings. I did not like adding taxes to everything and staff seemed underpaid to what is charged per night","Wonderful,  beautiful place on the ocean. But no AC and very hot and uncomfortable for this NW US boy.","At a time when most of Bali has become over-developed and congested, ShangriLa offers a true escape and simple living, with dedicated and kind staff to cater to your needs.

I was here as part of a Yoga Teacher Training and had an exceptional time.  The food at ShangriLa is vegetarian (+fish) and they do not serve alcohol.  The bungalows are open air (with mosquito nets) so you can hear the soothing sounds of the ocean all day!

At ShangriLa I met a local guide, Potok, who showed me around the town, went running with me, and included me in a local ceremony, dressing me in a sarong and headwear!  He added a personal element to my visit and I felt immersed in the local culture in a way that is often difficult to find.",Lived here for three weeks while attending yoga teacher training. Thank you for the life changing experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Once can watch the sunrise from the lawns. The water is right near the resort. The staff were very courteous, loving, hospitable and took very good care of us. The food was great and I learned how to cook a few new dishes. The driver was always there ahead of scheduled time to pick us up and also super helpful with giving us good advice on places to visit as well as places to have lunch when we were outside. We enjoyed the stay and hope to go back sometime.","Our family vacation composed of 23 adults and 2 kids was memorable!  We were at the resort for 8 nights.  Service was excellent and the resort was perfect for our family.  My husband Jeff and I celebrated our 27th wedding anniversary and my sister, Malou  and her husband Michael celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary together.  Food, venue, and show were superb!  Thanks to the attentive and outstanding staff for taking care of all of us ü•∞","We stayed for seven days during Dec'22. 21 family members with age group 23-80. We had a blast. Top notch facility, beautiful two swimming pools, amazing staff and great food prepared in the facility itself. Our family came from four different countries, we had travelled all over the world and still we rated this as one of the best and the life-time experience. Very very strong recommendation.","Stayed on this resort for almost a week with our extended family for the wedding anniversary of 2 of our relatives from the States, super clean and very helpful staff. The place is amazing","Absolutely the most wonderful place!  The staff is amazing, house/rooms and amenities are first class and the pool and beachfront location is perfect. The meals were especially great part of staying here. All made fresh daily by the staff and served beautifully. We only wish we could have stayed longer. I will be back!"

Room with clothes hangers, dim light, and it was always cleaned everyday, garden with fresh water shower, toilet tissue restocked, bath soap, tea, rosella, water refill provided","I enjoyed my stay here so much and I will definitely recommend to others and be back. The entire guesthouse and rooms are so lovely decorated and well taken care of. The staff are so kind and welcome you in like family. And my favorite part, the nature and peaceful ambience... I can't believe I saw beautiful coral reefs just a few steps away. A magical hidden gem in the North of Bali!",We stumbled upon this gem of a guest house. And wow what a place to relax and enjoy the view. Rooms are clean. Hot water shower. Beach is empty. Reef snorkeling is just off the beach directly in front. The staff are great and it's a good price. Breakfast included. There are only 4 rooms it's quiet it's perfect . The garden is lush with plenty of shade and the bird song in the morning is idyllic. We only planned a one night stay but extended our stay as it was so good.,"My favorite place to stay in Bondalem, Tejakula Village. The place is very homey. The staffs are very friendly & accommodating, almost like being at home. The room is clean and comfortable, nice garden, delicious food, and you can swim & snorkeling at the beach right in front of the guesthouse. Highly recommended for any travelers who would like to have a pleasant stay in Tejakula Village, North Bali üôÇ","""The luxury of simply good""
Tranquil place on the north shore of Bali. Family-led and extraordinary when it comes to service. Nice massages with nearby ocean waves, fresh coconuts from own palmtrees, great breakfast and even highly recommendable dinner and lunch is served (not included in price). Worryfree scooter rental and the impression of having a real impact on local business as it seems to be highly integrated into the local community. Even a seaside yogabale is free to use. Good starting point for diving adventures, snorkeling the house reef, shower in the nearby waterfall or see the indigo weavery nearby, or just read a good book at the beach and enjoy a coconut. Really hard to leave this place and continue the journey. We wish you all the best! Terimah kassih!"
