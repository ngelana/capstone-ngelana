Huge place with set up like stage. Food is as expected.

Kober noodles is famous with inexpensive but delicious meal.

Consistent food quality and affordable.

Always yummy and well affordable for pocket. Kids and young people love this place.","The place was so strategic because it's near the housing, the university, and some high schools. The parking space was wide enough. We need to queue to order the food and beverage. There's also gelato and fried rice. After we order the food we need to grab our table number to the place we want. After a few minutes the waiter or waitress will come to bring our food. I think it's a good place to hang out with some friends and also family friendly.","Quite,  nice, good food","Having nice dinner with my couple here...
Must try ""Es Tuyul"" creepy name but nice and tasty food","This place is different with others branch. Nice concept with live music.
Wait the order isn't a problem for me."

The food is delicious! We drove 30 minutes for this food and ate here two days in a row. It has been up there with the best Balinese/Indonesian food we have eaten over the past 4 weeks. It has been the best Nasi Campur we have tried. We also loved the koloke!! All the dishes we had were delicious and EVERYTHING is vegan and so many options.

The staff are super friendly and welcoming, there‚Äôs no fuss in terms of decor but it is a nice place to sit and enjoy.

The food is very cheap.

If we had found this place sooner I‚Äôm sure we would of ate here many more times.

We highly recommend üôå","Best food for the best price. Only 15k for nasi campur of your option with free soup?! And only 5k for coconut drinks. Preferable for breakfast, their menu is even complete in the morning.","The food here was all vegan and delicious. It is usually hard to find diversity of vegetarian/ vegan Indonesian food. However, this place has veganised many Indonesian dishes and it was lovely to taste the flavours!

There is also a fruit seller next doors who helped us understand the menu since he spoke English. We also bought the most delicious mangoes from him.","If you managed to discover this place, then congratulations, you just found a good vegetarian restaurant to eat. Their sidedish portion is so big that I need add rice to match the sidedish and the taste was like freshly made and flavorful. Looking forward to come here again.","The staff are super friendly and helpful, place is quite clean, and the food is tasty.

I've been here many times, but funny thing is that I've *never* seen the menu...

One time, I showed up quite late, and I was stuck with the limited buffet (leftover at end of the day). I wasn't expecting it but they gave me a discount which is a really nice gesture.

Honest and keen to make you happy, so I am glad to support this place. üëçüèªüôèüèª

Also their ""sausage"" and sayur urap is quite good.

The only negative is that they aren't closer to where I live xD"
