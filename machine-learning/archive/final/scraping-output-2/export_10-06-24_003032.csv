The location is great, direclty at the beach where you go on nice beach walks. The staff is super friendly and helpful. You can really enjoy, relax and recharge your batteries here. Also the food was super delicious. I will definitely come back.","What a lovely place ! It is a little gem in Bali I definitely recommend to stay ! The cabins are amazingly clean, the shower is fantastic. I had a wonderful stay, enjoyed the swimming pool with view on terrace and beach. Sunset over there is magical. The staff are absolutely great ( thank you to Diana who works with passion and love for this place), the food is excellent, garden is wonderfully well maintained. Everything was perfect and staying there few days made my holiday in Bali in the the best way I could not even imagine. It was magical ..","What a place! Nested in the jungle between rice fields and a deserted beach, the cabins have all it takes for a perfect, quiet stay. We did 2 nights at Desa because of a rather packed itinerary but could have easily stayed more time. Service, facilities and food were of the highest quality out of all the places we visited in Bali. Diana was super helpful with everything and arranged laundry, motorcycle rental and taxi the day we left. We couldn’t recommend this place enough!","Balian is one of my favorite getaways in Bali and this was our first visit to Desa Cabins. We had an amazing experience. The location is absolutely breathtaking, Bali on its best. The cabins are very cute, new and they thought of every detail. The staff is amazing; very friendly and I love the fact that there’s a restaurant also. Will definitely go back for a longer time.","What a beautiful haven tucked away in a palm grove, a one minute walk to the beach! Five cabins, a fabulous staff and a lovely breakfast. I had to extend my stay! Very special views at Desa Cabins. I highly recommend it."
