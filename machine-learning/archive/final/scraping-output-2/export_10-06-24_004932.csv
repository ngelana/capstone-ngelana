Thank you.","Nice food but If you are starving don‚Äôt come here!

Take almost an hour until your order to be arrived.  Looks like they prioritize takeaways or online orders (which are a lot) while the dine-in customers are just left hanging in here waiting while starving.

If you just want some snack and hangout, well, it‚Äôs not exactly a cozy place to hangout anyway.","If you want spicy junk food, it's a great place to go. Nothing special, always crowded. Cheap. Food court style restaurant","The place is very comfortable and cool because it is close to the rice fields behind it. The service is friendly and you don't have to wait long for the food. My favorite menu is spicy noodles and cheese shrimp, which are very delicious.ü§§üôè","The place is spacious, clean, lots of chairs are provided. Place has industrialist design. Always playing loud music. Spicy noodle food. Paid parking space."

But the place has great music and good food. I had the Terbawa Rasa Pizza personal size - delicious, and I would go back for more. üçï
But for certain, it's finding this place in the middle of seemingly nowhere that makes it so great.
Uma Batukaru is a local hidden gem. üíé","Amazing restaurant surrounded by ride fields. I fed myself and 2 others, with a bottle of spirit and dessert for 35 bucks.","Hidden gem in the city of tabanan, great paddyfield view, spacious place, they also have live music, and also kids club.","I was around on Tabanan city and looking for a place to have lunch. I'm glad that I choose to have lunch here! I was ordering strawberry coffee mocktail (unique taste and good, and a very cute glass!). And for the meal I was trying nasi ayam bakar and ayam kuah pedas (it's ok spicy, good for tummy). The access to the place was interesting too. Feels like adventuring. Good for the belly sensation before the lunch.
Overall, a good place to visit, friendly to pocket and good for lunch. I heard that they do live music on weekend too, def will check it.","Place was great, food not really good,"

I passed by the street and stooped by in PHD, place was good, only few seating considering for delivery service. Pizza was great as usual. The jelly cappuccino was too sweet.
The problem is when I finished order and waiting, women staff was suddenly singing out loud, following the background song. It‚Äôs not polite when there is customer in front waiting for the order!
I think is not a good choice to come directly here, better via phone.","This is how my delivery arrived. Cold and dry
