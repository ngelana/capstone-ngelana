It has Nice infinite pool over looking the island. They cooked dinner for us every night and we watched the sunset from up top as we ate. They had a scooter for us to rent and even helped us with laundry. In the middle of the jungle this was the ultimate experience I always wanted. I couldnâ€™t ask for more. They are very professional and answered quickly whenever we had a question. I definitely recommend this place.,"Absolutely gorgeous location! The infinity pool with the view back toward Bali and Mt.
