I recently stayed at Villa DK Bali and unfortunately, my experience with the management left me disappointed. While the house itself was satisfactory, I encountered several issues that significantly impacted my stay.

First and foremost, the miscommunication with Donny was a major source of frustration. It seemed that there was a lack of clarity and understanding on his part, leading to unnecessary confusion and inconvenience. This miscommunication became especially apparent when it came to the charges. Despite the website promising additional amenities and services, we were unexpectedly charged for everything. This discrepancy between what was advertised and what we actually received was disappointing, to say the least.

On a more positive note, the house itself was pleasant. It provided a comfortable and enjoyable space for our stay. The amenities were generally in good condition, and the overall cleanliness was satisfactory. It is unfortunate that the management's shortcomings overshadowed the positive aspects of the property.

In conclusion, while the house at Villa DK Bali was decent, the management's miscommunication and unexpected charges left a sour taste in my mouth. It is my hope that they address these issues and improve their communication and transparency in the future.","The location is a little off, but with a driver or rental it's fine.
The team was very helpful and nice.
Unfortunately the villa wasn't as luxurious as expected, three ACs lost water during our 3 night stay, a few details could've been repaired.","The villa is really calm, clean and luxurious. It is also situated in a very quiet and calm neighbourhood. There is always a staff member from the villa and they are really helpful and accommodating. A special thanks to Eddy and Donny. They are really welcoming and are passionate about their jobs and are always ready to help and Eddy is a really good driver. Thanks again and we hope to see you in the future :)","Absolutely stunning Villa, the pictures don't do it justice. We were greeted by Mr Donny, who gave us a full tour of the 3 bedroom Villa and then told us that he was our personal driver for our stay in Nusa Dua. He also said, when he drops us to places he would wait for us but we said there was no need. He insisted on waiting in the car while we went to the beach, went for dinner etc. Breakfast was freshly cooked in the kitchen by the house maid and we were woken to the sound of a gong to let us know breakfast was ready. It was a 5 star service for our stay at villa DK.","My friends and I absolutely had an amazing time at Villa DK! The service and hospitality is spectacular.

Mr. Donny is such an accomodating Villa Manager and definitely knows the ins and outs of Nusa Dua. The Villa also includes a driver that can take you around the area free of charge and you can request to be taken out to tour destinations for a reasonable price.

The Driver, Mr. Eddy is the sweetest human ever! You‚Äôll definitely be entertained with his fun chats in the car.

The house maids were also very kind and patient with our requests! Our stay included a complimentary breakfast every morning. Definitely have to try Ms. Uci‚Äôs Omelettes omg she is an AMAZING cook üôåüèª Highly recommend choosing this for breakfast.

Overall our stay at Villa DK was nothing but memorable. We‚Äôll definitely be staying here for our next visit!"
