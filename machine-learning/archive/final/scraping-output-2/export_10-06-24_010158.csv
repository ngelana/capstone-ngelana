Even though it's located in the middle of denpasar, the atmosphere is like ubud. The cafe itself is surrounded by a rice field. It's a big enough outdoor area and they have a lot of tables.

The food for me is good, order fried noodles, a glass of sweet tea and a beer.
The price is fair i guess. They have lunch promo, around 99K for 2 pax.

Some advice, make sure to use a trouser because a lot of mosquitoes, or maybe bring some bug repellent. In my case because it's my first time coming here, the friendly staff gave us Autan.

Visit time : Afternoon","Been here for 3x times, i like their old style but after they‚Äôre changed it so so much bad at everything!! Do not come to this place ever! , food was suck waiting almost 1 hour and came like warung style, their cutlery even had some bubbles of soap on it, the worst restaurant i ever had for my special valentine day!. They ask to pay at first is the stupid thing. Please open your eyes and do something better !!","Came to try this place. Lovely atmosphere, friendly staff, unfortunately they were playing loud disco music complete with DJ which was too much to endure. It was so loud we couldn't even chat.

Rice fields view, menu looks good, but we had to leave as we can no longer endure the loud disco music which was so out of place.","The place is so close to nature, nearby the rice field. Even though you sit outdoor, it's not that hot.

The food tasted exquisite and worth the price you pay. I ordered smoked chicken orange sauce. The chicken was so tender. I liked the orange sauce, I could taste the orange but it doesn't cover the taste of the chicken itself. Altough, for my preference, the mashed potato needed a little bit more seasoning.

They offer some alcohol beverages as well. I paid one cocktail for two because the waitress told me that they had a promo buy 1 get 1 free until 6 PM only.

I visited on Saturday night and there was a live music. The singer's voice was so good, it made my night even better. I definitely will be back.",It's a hidden gem in Denpasar. A restaurant located in the middle of rice field. It's a short walk if you're coming using a car since it's located inside a small narrow road. Surrounded by many plants and rice field giving a unique dining experience. The food is affordable and tasty.

So disappointed with all..
I'm not recommended with this room. We're decided just 1 day then moved another villa","I arrived at 11pm tired and they charged me a double price than it was booked originally.
They were fairly rude and didn't want to speak with me and explain anything. Like ""pay or get out"".
I didn't want to search for other place in the midnight and paid.
So, be aware, they are cheating customers and have no ideas about proper service and communication.

Room is tiny and with no window. AC didn't work.","We came to the place being extremely tired from far away having booking, but there was no available room for staying and the even didn‚Äôt cancel it on application.
