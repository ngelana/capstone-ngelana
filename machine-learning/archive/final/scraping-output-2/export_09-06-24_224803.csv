The sunset was beautiful and the black lava was super cool. We also got the chance to visit a coffee plantation afterwards and that made the day even betterðŸ¤©
Mangku and Mardi picked us up and drove us the whole day and they are truly super nice and friendly. We really recommend going with them as they did the trip better and did everything they could to make sure we had a good time.
We would also like to say a big thank you to Purnami who drove our jeep up the mountain and took AMAZING photos of us. We also strongly recommend going with her.
Over all it was a fantastic experience and so beautiful, if you are in Ubud or anywhere near Mount Batur we highly recommend doing this trip as you will never forget it.",Great trip. Jordon was a caring and wonderful guide. Def worth the early start. Def stretch the heart and legs. Exhilarating! Loved every minute of it.  Even sucking in the air for breath. Good work out. 13 yo loved it too. Just do yourself a favour and go do it!! Baths are wonderful at the end,"Good view and may guide is safety
And good breakfast on the top of mount batur","It was an awesome experience with the perfect mix of three things: sunrise at the volcano, a nice bath at the hot springs and an interesting visit at the coffee plantation with a tasting. Putu the organizer made sure that everything went smooth and he even picked us up personally - such a cool and friendly guy. For everyone who likes to see a lot in a short period of time this is the perfect activity. And with Putu as organizator it was even better!","We hiked mount batur yesterday morning to get sun rise,me and my wife really enjoyed it.
We got Jero Sada as our guider
Good recomendation for the first time hiking 10/10"
