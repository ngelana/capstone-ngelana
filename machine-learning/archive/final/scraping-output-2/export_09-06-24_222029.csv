I came at noon after leaving the accommodation so we missed seeing the dolphins. but this place is still worth visiting. There are many cafes, craft shops and souvenirs around the beach, which can be used to pass the time while waiting for the sun set time. Unfortunately we didn't spend long time there because it was midday and the environment was so hot besides we had our next journey. There are many boats around the beach that can be rented by tourists who want to go to the sea to see dolphins or snorkeling, the prices offered are also very reasonable, around one hundred thousand for each person. Entry the beach for free, just pay the vehicle parking fee for those who bring private vehicles.","Nice place to take a photo, clean. There are many stall & snacks you can buy on the area","A lovely beach at the North of Bali. The locals will offer you to watch dolphins at morning time. Usually 100k/person, but if you come with friend/groups try to bargain.","Lovina is a quiet but romantic beachside town in Bali. The famous Dolphin Statue is a landmark on Lovina Beach and a must visit beach for all. One can indulge in a delicious breakfast at a local beachside café, savoring the flavors of Indonesian cuisine while taking in the breathtaking coastal views. You can immerse yourself in the relaxed atmosphere, stroll along the sandy shores, and discover the unique charm of Lovina.

The Lovina beach is perfect for nature enthusiasts, and those seeking a serene escape. Whether you're traveling with family, friends, or a loved one, Lovina’s Dolphin Statue beach area promises an unforgettable experience in the tranquil beauty of Bali.","A great place for sunset. The bar on the beach is very cheap, 15k orange juice. They also play live music. Locals smiles and very nice, there are many shops on the beach and restaurants. The view is nicer then south Bali (kuta, Seminyak) and also cheaper"

Only thing is that there wasn't a bin and the sheets were a tinge to small but otherwise no complaints.",Nice place to stay super close to warungs shops beach.

The pasta and tuna were cooked perfectly with the creamy pesto. The curry was nice. The smoothie also yumm.","The salad and potatoe wedges were very good. Also had the Avocado toast - asked for no feta but it still came with feta, the poached egg was sadly hard inside. The parmesan fries tasted like out of a old baking ofen or fried with some very old oil. Even after letting them be fried again, same taste. Cant recommend those.
Otherwise a cute cafe with nice service and pretty interior.",Love the place and the ambience. Enough space and not too loud. But the backyard is a little too hot outside in the afternoon so it’s best to save yourself a seat in the indoor space on the 1st floor. They also offer various menus.

My apartment was one of the furthest from the reception on foot, but with the paradisiacal surroundings, the walk to breakfast was very pleasant. The location by the pool was also a highlight for me. The room was very clean and comfortable to stay in. There are many restaurants and supermarkets within a few minutes walk. Very quiet apartment, very large with air conditioning. The bathroom is very fancy but offers everything you need.","This review is more a cautionary tale about unplanned growth than the Rambutan Hotel. Lovina is noisy. I left Kuta and thought the less crowded north coast would be a quiet reprieve from bustling Kuta. Unfortunately, Lovina is a victim of un-planned growth that challenges any traveler to find a quiet hotel. I have stayed in 3 hotels in Lovina: Pandawa Village, Rambutan Boutique Hotel and New Sunari Lovina. The New Sunari Lovina is the only quiet hotel I found. Pandawa Village is off the main road next to a beautiful rice field. It was quiet all day. About 8:00 pm the music started at the Funky Place Bar with the bass pounding the peace until late at night. The hotel staff said they had asked them to keep the volume down to no avail. Rambutan Bungalows has a different and completely uncontrollable noise problem. About 10:00 I heard this roar that was impossible to identify. After a week in the hotel the source became very clear. The young Balinese drive motorcycles customized to produce the loudest engine noise possible. They aspire to make their 125cc motorcycles sound like Harleys. This goes on all day but is particularly apparent at night when the youth drive up and down the main tourist street leading to the beach. Unfortunately, every hotel on the street is subject to the same noise. I had probed the hotel staff before booking the room and they said no one had ever complained. Possibly that is because most people don't stay more than 1-2 nights and don't seem to mind the noise. Essentially, the game in Lovina is to find a hotel with motorcycle or bar/restuarant noise spilling out to the surrounding area. Since hotels are comingled with the bars this is almost an impossibility. I believe this is one of the few cities I've visited where the entertainment district is situated amongst the hotels. The wisdom of keeping them separate has really been an epiphany. Noise pollution is a very real problem for anyone staying for an extended time in Lovina.
Rambutan is a beautiful Hotel with wonderful gardens and a very pleasant staff. I particularly like the open air reception .","Wow - what an incredible oasis Richard and Tini have created. A gem in the heart of Lovina's tourism area. My partner and I stayed for two weeks. We upgraded rooms half way through just for a change of scenery. We could've spent our entire time around the pool but there was lots to see and do. The only downside was the quality of food at the Ramburan restaurant. Eating at the local Warung's is much preferred but we certainly ate a few meals at the hotel, it was about average. The cocktails and service was an upside. Always incredible service from their team - a special thank you to Geedee, Dewi and Putu for putting up with us. The spa was great too, many massages had. I hope we'll be back again soon!",Beautiful grounds and pools.  Room was nice but we did get an upgrade.  Staff friendly.  Handy to beach and restaurants.,"Nice hotel with nice garden. Our safe and the hot water was not working, but the staff fixed it quite soon. The breakfast ist not very good (choice and portion). I had three small toast with butter and jam. But the jam was only enough for one. We leaved the hotel at 1am because of a tour and tried to get a breakfast to go. We went to the reception three times - quite a hassle."

I liked the first visit so much that there was no question that I would go there again for dinner the next evening. I was looking for restaurants with a vegan selection and that's why I ended up at this one.

The property was clean and in a great location next to good restaurants and a brisk walk to the beach. The puppies were an added bonus.,"The hotel is in a good location. The dormitory was clean and the staff was friendly. I think I was alone in the hotel because I didn’t see anyone else and it was quite expensive compared to the other hostels in the region. The dormitory was like a hotel room without curtains.

I have booked the dolphins tour in the hostel. I have decided on the bigger tour. Was cool but on the tour you  have to expected many many other boats","Reception staff / owners were so rude upon arrival. While checking in tried to persuade us to cancel our dolphin tour and book with them instead. Said they’d only be able to help us book a taxi if we went on their tour. Charged us for another night because we we ran slightly over check out time which was more expensive than our first night. Doesn’t reply to emails. Nonetheless, rooms were clean / nice. They had a cute dog.","Just what you need when travelling to Lovina - a pleasant, clean, family-run guesthouse, offering both dorms and private rooms. Just 5 minute walk from Lovina beach, offering dolphin watching for a very reasonable price (100k p.p) and including breakfast.
The cons: Dorms aren't divided and don't provide any privacy (like a curtain in many other hostels). Shower was enough but can be better and the pool didn't look inviting as in the pictures.","Okay facilities, good location but unfortunately the service wasn’t great! Breakfast included is a scam because it was not good. Also they charged us extra for sunscreen marks on their towels. Greedy attitude which made our experience worse!"

Our breakfast was simply the best the fruit bowl was very generous. We really enjoyed the stay in this hotel.

Comments: dont be put off with the ugly drive way. No bar fridge in the room, but we could use the main kitchen fridge. No mirror inside the room. Rubbish bin in the room would be nice. Tea and coffee making facilities in the room would be good, although they said to use the kitchen to make morning coffees if we wanted to. Having said all of this I still recommend the place.","We enjoyed 4 nights at this wonderful little oasis.

The room is comfortable with AC. To be honest, the water pressure could be better but we have fresh water for shower at least, so no complaints.

Swimming pool is nice and clean. Definitely a retreat on a hot day. Spa was nice, did shiatsu massage.

Bar selection is good. Also, all the items in the menu were available - something I found was a problem in other restaurants in Lovina.

Location is A1 with Lovina beach right at your doorstep.

And finally a huge shout out to Manda and Komang from reception, who made our stay that much better.","The staff are nice and overall the price makes sense. It's a budget stay and therefore cleanliness, facilities, food quality, are all pretty low. Our room had lots of termite dust and felt dirty in general, for example the bed sheets had sand or something in them. If you want to be close to the beach and sports bars then this location would be ideal for you. Bonus points for a cute dog that lives on the premises.","Great and affordable place near Lovina beach. Beautiful garden with loads of plants and flowers. Breakfast with fresh fruits, bread, eggs and some Indonesian dishes like fried rice. I payed € 20,- per night for a double room. Recommended! Area is also good: bars/restaurants on the beach and a diverse range of water activities like snorkeling or scuba diving are organized from here.","If you want a great location without breaking your budget, with an eclectic vibe, then this is your place. The rooms are simple. No TV. But there's just enough outlets to charge your phone or laptop. The aircon is cool and the bathroom is spacious...even if it is slightly ""en plein air"".
The included breakfast buffet had a generous schedule that frequently let me grab a little something past the 10am mark. It was simple but delicious. The staff were gracious and helpful to schedule a dolphin watch tour.
The location is great because you can walk to everything. Pepito's market is about a 10 minute walk, and the beach is only 100m or so. Plenty of bars and restaurants with live music in all directions. We talked to one guest that has been there for 3 months!"

We were up and about early in the morning so didn’t get to enjoy the breakfast but thoroughly recommend staying here.","The location is perfect, not far from the city and tourist area, however it's so quiet at night, which is nice.

This looks like a legendary hotel with a very humble hospitality, all the staffs are friendly.

some area needs retouch, but the public area is very clean. The room is also clean, the AC works perfectly. Even tho the hotel is an old property, i'm sure it is properly and regularly maintained.

With a relatively cheap price, i have enjoyable experience.","Very nice rooms, beautiful place.
Only negatives is that there's only a fan in our room, no ac. And the wifi is very slow. Otherwise the location is perfect and the pool is great.","We stayed 3 nights here and it was really comfortable! The pool was really nice and clean, the room was so spacious! A huge balcony to relax on which was really nice. The outside areas were so lovely, lots of nature, banana trees and mango trees and beautiful flowers. 🌼🌸"

6days at LL was exactly what the 'doctor' ordered! I was relaxed and decompressed in the casual and retro setting. Clean rooms and wonderful toilets brought me back to accommodations found on small islands, back to no tv and most times patchy wifi. They also provided large wonderfully fresh smelling towels even! Ms Marry tried to help everyone including with room, transport needs, spa/massages or tour packages. Was given a free upgrade due to a room mix up and allowed to remain there for 6days despite high demand for rooms. Aircon was cold, towels large and smelled great. Any help needed was just a request away from Ms Marry and her 2 capable staff! Felt very much at home. Thank you for the warm hospitality!","The best hostel EVER. We stayed a few months ago and had the hostel was beautiful, so clean and good facilities near to everything. Kadek was so kind to us, we had to leave in a rush and couldn’t get a grab to where we were going. He took us himself and drove us all the way to Padangbai to ensure we got there safely. The staff are so lovely going over and above. If you’re going to Lovina stay here. The kindest staff & beautiful hostel","Room was okay for price. However the owner is so rude, she ignored me multiple times when I tried to speak to her which made me feel super uncomfortable and unwelcome.","The lady charged me 3x the normal amount for laundry. I only found out after I did my second laundry.
Also, the staff got into an argument with a client late at night causing everyone to wake up from it because he staff started screaming and yelling. The lady is absolutely crazy, she does not know how to communicate and will do everything to get more money out of you.
Very sad to see such a nice designed hostel go to waste by the staff","I stayed with my daughter for one week in this lovely hostel.
Merry, the lady who is responsible for managing everything, is the nicest and most helpful person you can imagine. She is always positive, happy and smiling.
The welcoming way of the staff was just a pleasure and we liked the good Bali massage lessons.
The clean room was nice with a bathroom and a warm shower.
We partecipated at a yoga and meditation program on ""Dreamhill"" where we had three meals a day.
We highly recommend this budget hostel and we thank the staff for the kindness.

We would love to try their dessert on the display but too bad the cafe was about to close at 9 pm. Maybe next time","I frequented this cute cafe while I stayed in Lovina for a few weeks.
They have great coffee (and the little biscuit that comes with it was yum!), great drinks, great brekkie, great cakes, lunch a bit average.
The gentleman server is great, the girl lovely but slow, even on quiet days.
All in all, loved the cafe, would return.","rare 5 star review. excellent choice for breakfast. central location so walking an option. extra star for no obnoxious awful same 15 songs u hear in bali nonstop. just quiet. fresh bakery as well. very good juice and coffee. omelette was also good and pretty large portion. great prices, cheaper than surrounding options. only one staff member on duty and he was very timely and polite. highly recommended.",Food was fantastic! I got some home comfort food (aka chicken nuggets and chips) and it tasted like they do at home :). The smoothie bowl was also amazing. Staff are super friendly and nice. AC keeps it cool also,"I went to Cafe Greco twice and each time it was exceptional. The coffee and pastries taste amazing and they are all super well presented! The service is fast and the workers are polite. Although all these things are great, my favourite thing about Cafe Greco is the atmosphere! This place is an adorable, cozy cafe that looks aesthetically pleasing and is surprisingly quiet. Additionally the price is reasonable for what you get. Cafe Greco is just a really great place to go overall, I'd really recommend going here for an afternoon coffee and cake because it just makes your day better. (The chocolate mousse cake and coconut brownie is the best!)"

So far this was the cleanest hotel we had experience with in Bali, but really the people working there topped the whole stay. Drinking water & fridge were provided, the bathroom was very nice as well. Romanto was helping us with any questions and inquiries we had, booked a dolphin whatching & swimming tour through him and also went fishing with the same boat/captain who was also a very nice man. Would recommend this hotel to everyone.","Good stay here, quiet room all to yourself. Big room, bed, little kitchen with all the basic cooking essentials you’d need (oil, salt, pans, pots etc). Free water to use to cook with. Comfy stay but the Air con is an old machine so it didn’t get cold, had to sleep on top of the bed each night.",Absolutely amazing stay! The rooms are so big and offer a bathroom with separate bathroom and wet room as well as private kitchen! The pool is stunning and the location is very convenient for restaurants. The beach is only a 10 minute walk so no worries if you don’t have a motorbike. Would not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you very much for the helpful and friendly service too.,"Our room was big and we liked the novelty of having a kitchen (drinking water was provided for cooking, which was great). The rooms are quite old, the airconditioning was loud, some chipping paint etc but clean enough. The large well maintained pool was the highlight for us.","Very clean, quiet and nice place to stay. Staff is very warmhearted and open to help in any kind of questions. Real pearl in the area 👏🏻"

Poor restaurant (pick anything from the menu, it will be already 'sold out'), but friendly staff (not speaking so much English). There are much better places than this for the same money, keep looking.","I was buying voucher at Fave for only IDR250/night, which is very cheap. Not a lot of review about this place, but it's totally worth it, even in normal prices . The room are huge, has a sofa which can be use for another person. Bed are comfortable, and they are generous with the pillow. TV are okay. They provide medium size refrigerator. The bathroom was big, with the tub fully functioning along with the heater. Although its kinda leaking, but for this price to provide bathtub. They only provide shampoo and small bar soap which I don't recommend using it. AC works okay. Location wise, near to the beach. Staff are helpful and friendly","Clean, quite room.. cold AC, TV great, hot water available in bathroom, bathtub.. the room is big enough.. tapi shower ada di atas bathtub..? staff named Diah is friendly, pretty..",Clean place & close to the beach.

If the purpose is to just spend the night as cheap as possible then it’s perfect.

Liked  · The host is super welcoming and contributes big time to the experience. He taught me how to play domino and took me to a local chicken fight that was thrilling even if it was brutal ! Had a tradition breakfast for free and tea.  Just spend the night and continued my trip.

Disliked  · Having expectations is not recommended. It’s dirty, there are cockroaches in the bathroom and the single room has no windows therefore no fresh air. There is an annoying fan that does little to no job. BUT still better than sleeping in almost same conditions but also with other people.","DON'T BOOK ANY TOURS HERE!
You are going to get promissed stuff that they know you are not going to see.
Owner of the place will give hands off any responsibility.","The menager of the hostel helped me a lot. He suggested me a restaurant for dinner, he brought me to the closet Atm to withdraw money, ANDDDD I GET A LOVELY TATTOO FROM HIM. And we played domino. It's really a simple place, simple but very welcoming. ☺️🪷🙏🏻","The room for the price is okej. The place should be little bit renovated. But. We just want to stay ovenight and they push you to take dolphins tour. Even you say, that you don't want to. It was really enoying.

Evening we played domino and drink some alkohol with cola. They really love to play domino. But we just sometimes needed our space.

The man has some problems with behavior, the young girl is really nice.

However, if you want to save money by accomodation for one night is good.

But i do not recommended it.","UNSAFE EXPERIENCE. In the morning after the staff left at 10am, I was having breakfast - a local man turned up on pink scooter, approached me and groped me. With no one around this was terrifying, the number to call didn't work, so after running to the place down the road I ended up staying there the next night, which was super safe.
Concerns are for solo female travelers coming here in low season, be aware that these things can happen in situations you'd think are safe. Also unsure if any staff slept at the property, which is a concern especially if you're the only guest. Don't expect someone to be there when you want to check in, either.
The owner has a very forceful presence, I found him uncomfortable to be around. When I arrived I was so tired but he told me to wait for his friend who owned a diving shop, who was also an uncomfortable, pushy presence. I was also told they provide free rice wine mixed with cola every night whilst you play dominoes, which sounds strange, too (I went to bed too early to witness this, but see other reviews). Generally untrustworthy and ambushing. A couple of days later the owner brought the 'crazy guy' local to the new place I stayed at 11pm, made me feel extremely uncomfortable and upset, demanding to know what had happened (when he definitely already knew from the staff of the new place) and I got the sense he didn't believe me.
And the place: The room at the back had some bed bugs at the time. Shower water made my hair smell strongly of rust, hot tea had the taste of it too. I was too tired from missing a night of sleep at Ijen to notice or care for much else."
