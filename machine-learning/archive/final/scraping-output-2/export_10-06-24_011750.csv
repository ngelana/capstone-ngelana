Had a great stay here.",I was fortunate to live here long term during the pandemic and it was my favourite place to live in Bali. The location is perfect. So quiet and a short drive to everything you need. The villas are great and have everything you need. The staff were the best and always so kind and helpful with anything we needed. I miss Bukit Kirana so much! I recommend it to anyone coming to Bali ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Please note, after this review the management have fixed all the problems. The issue is fixed. Thank you.

DO NOT BOOK THIS VILLA. Once they have your money, they forget all the promises. It‚Äôs not as it looks on the pictures, there is missing furniture and other appliance, that refuse to provide, even though its essential furniture or kitchen appliances. Very poor management.","I have good memories in this place when in pandemic with my familly, i dont know when we goona have a chance like that again.

But thanks for great one month for the hosiptailty, i know you were struggling when pandemic, but its worth it for my famillies alot.","Negatives:
The conditions do not look like the photos anymore. During our stay, we had problems with ants and insects, stray and neighbors‚Äô cats roamed and visited at night messing up with bins and food, roof was leaking, water pressure was low, cooking utensils were disgustingly rusted, linen was stained and defo far away from hotel quality (you're charged for changing linen, which should not be standard thing when  you stay in the villa, so expect paying lots money for that!, definitely was not informed about it during check in - let alone telling you how much it'd be, they expect you to sleep on the same linen for months!), and pile of trash welcoming you at the front of the complex.

Might be fine for a short stay, but if you plan to rent the place for long term, make sure you have a watertight and detailed contract - otherwise enjoy being yelled by the agent/ owner. Very far from being treated as tenant/ guests. There's nothing good to say about the owner/agent.

Positives:
Friendly and helpful staff.
Nice and clean pool.
Beautiful garden."

The villa is so gorgeous, love the atmosphere, the cozy room and relaxing pool area. beautifully designed and decorated. The cooking equipment are complete. The staff here are very friendly and helpful. would not consider staying anywhere other than here and will recommend The Ocean Views Luxury Villas & Apartment to my friends and relatives.","The villa looks exactly the same like the photos I saw on Airbnb, actually even better than what I expected coz I didn‚Äôt know we would be able to see the sea view from the rooftop pool (coz the photos in the app didn‚Äôt show), that‚Äôs definitely a surprise for our stay. The whole villa is neat and tidy in general (there are some ants in one of the bathrooms but it‚Äôs a super minor problem and we didn‚Äôt mind it at all), and it‚Äôs super spacious as well, love it! We regret for not staying long enough to enjoy the villaü•π

Most importantly, the staff were so nice and politeüòá I‚Äôd especially like to shout out to Cavin, a super sweet and helpful staff who helped us a lot when we prepared a surprise game to celebrate our friend‚Äôs birthday. Not only did he help us keep the cake in the office first when we went out, but he also helped us print our materials when we forgot to bring them to Bali‚Ä¶ Thanks to Cavin, staying in this villa has become one of our best memories in Bali that we would never forget!

Strongly recommend this villa to those who want a memorable stay in Uluwatu!!üíï","The room was great with an awesome view of the ocean.  Wifi worked great and the bathroom,  shower was really good too.

We also had a good evening watching TV in the lounge.

One small issue is access.. you need to walk about 5 mins with a bit of an incline as there is only motorbike access.  No issue for us as we enjoy the walk.","The worst place I've ever been to, I wasn't allowed to enter to meet my boss, on the grounds that I had to show an ID card, even though many visitors were already inside and I had time to ask if I was asked for an ID card?  apparently not !  very strict regulations exceeding the presidential palace, and it's strange again when arguing with the manager, instead making an issue of the other, making a problem what shouldn't be a problem, even though everyone here asks for a middle ground but gets a bad response from the manager, I suggest you all look for a place  where you can have fun without being bound by unreasonable rules","WARNING!!

My wife, my 1-year-old daughter, and ÔøºI rented The Ocean Views Luxury Villas & Apartment for 2 weeks.
After the first week, we were brutally kicked out with a few hours' notes.
They said the reason was thatÔøº we did not wash the dishes and because my Daughter pumped on a towel. (there was cleaning 2 times a day).
Not only they did not refund us Ôøº correctly, but they also ÔøºÔøºÔøº attacked,  attack, my wife with my daughter in her arms, I had to stop the manager Ôøºfrom fiscally heating my wife while he continued screaming for us to leave and that he is Indonesian and we are the truest with no right‚Äôs.
We were so scared, my wife was traumatized to the point we cut our Holidays short and run home to safetyÔøº.
There is no point in having a nice villa if the Manager treat gust with violence Ôøºand disrespect ( no matter the reason, a full-grown man has no right to Ôøºviolently scream and point and nearly hit a woman with a baby in her arms.
I write this review hoping that nobody passed true what we did.
Ps, the staff was super nice and even apologize for the way the manager treated us.
In ÔøºBali there are many nice villas, I highly suggest nobody stay in this place.ÔøºÔøºÔøº"

Because of their screaming, I constantly wake up when I sleep. Their cry prevents me from resting, prevents me from middling. Peace and tranquility is the basic thing that should become the owner of such a business. Dear owner, do you know that many hotels in Bali do not allow children to stay? Because children are constantly screaming and disturbing other tenants. And you have screaming, running, yelling children are not guests, but the staff !!! Many guys who now live in the guesthouse are already looking for new housing and will soon move out because of this scream and silence. It's unbearable. When you are trying to relax, sleep, be in silence, and at your door the children of the staff are yelling, running and riding a scooter .... And I would also like to note that the most disgusting behavior of the child Bo. Terribly uneducated child.","If you're surfer, a downshifter or you're just on the simple island vibe and plan to stay for an extended period of time it's just a perfect option in the middle of Ungasan and Uluwatu.

Went there on a Saturday night in my quest to find the perfect tiramisu which I still haven't found. Read the Google reviews and decided to go there although it's an hour's drive.

The restaurant was empty, with no guests but us and a few staff. Ordered antipasti 1st and it took almost 40 mnt. Ordered the next dish which was pizza and spaghetti bolognese. Here comes the drama..

We had to wait for another 40 minutes for pizza and until our pizza was almost finished, my pasta wasn't there.. So I asked where's my pasta, and she said it's coming. But somehow I knew that they had forgotten my order!! Anyway.. She said that another 7 mnt because they cooked the pasta from RAW ( I asked her, did you make the pasta from scratch?) She said no, it's from a package.. hahahahhaa...

Instead of saying sorry they forgot my pasta, she kept giving me excuses but anyway, I waited and after 10 minutes, she came to inform me another 5 minutes.

Finally, my pasta arrived, nice presentation but unfortunately, the pasta was undercooked instead of al dente üòÖüòÖ so so disappointed!! She offered to make a new one but I felt gutted already.

Anyways, tiramisu came out ok tho.. Very light and creamy.
