Eventhough you have to wait for almost 45 minutes but the taste was totally fantastic. It was served well with pork fat soup that so juicy till melt on your tongue. For spicy lover absolutely perfect. The one and only my advice is come with motor cycle and not a car if you dont wanna have a problem with parking and exit. Juicy meat, tasty and rotally yummy.","One of the best Balinese food that i love the most. No need to ask how does the taste of the food, as shown by the count of stars. The pork belly was so juicy!!! And they‚Äôre come with quiet big slices consider how cheap they‚Äôre!!

I recommend you to come to this place early in the morning around 8.30 up to 10.00 am to enjoy its fresh atmosphere..","The main dish is really good, i actually love it, with affordable price and you get plenty for one serving. Place and atmosphere are okay, but this restaurant located a bit far from main road and there is only one small road for entry and exit. So if you go here by car, expect some traffic especially on weekend, but don't worry there are plenty of parking space.
There's one problem that really bothers me when last time i visited with my family. It was on sunday and all of the tables were occupied. There's no waiting list, so people can easily snatch an empty table even if they come later than us. So we got to wait for another hour to get a table. But fortunately the food was worth the wait and we were satisfied. If you want to avoid crowds, just don't come on weekends.",Balinese restaurant with the best taste and priceüëçüòãüê∑,"My gosh....foods are amazing....must...is a must to come here. The way to go there is so hard but really worth it. Price sooo affordable, taste amazing, very fast service....two üëçüëç"
