However, housekeeping was not that good.. no tissues in the room ,we found mosquitoes (mainly in the toilet) and 2 flies flying around in the bedroom. Kettle not provided, and when we wanted to have one, the receptionist said it‚Äôs not available. We also found the shower facility is not cleaned  / toilet walls n floors, door are  quite dirty which may have attracted the mosquitoes.","I booked this hotel for 15 nights but since my flight was rescheduled, I wanted to reschedule the hotel booking as well. It was said in the app that I CAN AMEND THE DATE of my booking WITHOUT amendment fee so I tried to contact Agoda cs to help me to change the date since there‚Äôs an issue when I tried to pay for the new booking date. Unfortunately, the Agoda team couldn‚Äôt contact the hotel and said there‚Äôs also a language barrier when they tried to communicate with the hotel. I have to wait for 2 days more for the hotel team to disapprove my request with no explanation.

Since today is the check-in date and my flight was rescheduled, so apparently it will be treated as a No-Show and will incur a charge of 100% of the booking value.

I read the reviews of this place and I AM GLAD that I don‚Äôt have to stay in this place. I would never booked this hotel ever again. They didn‚Äôt think of customers satisfaction at all.","BAD QUALITY FOR HOSPITALITY MANEGEMENT. We‚Äôre checked in at night, no greeting from receptionist, they also asked extra charge for additional adult (1 pax) because we‚Äôre 3 people to stay. I‚Äôm as hotelier too at Jakarta, 3 peoples at room, it doesn‚Äôt matter as long as the guest feel comfort. BUT HERE, you have to pay extra. Then, we prefer choose pay extra for extrabed, but there‚Äôs hole in the extrabed sheet.

No provide slippers & no phone (incase of emergency) at rooms. Then we‚Äôre asking for late checkout until 1pm, the lady at receptionist, they even can‚Äôt give us late checkout until 1pm.

Bad hotel facilities & services. Not recommended.","Terrible smell, terrible maintenance and the rooms are worse. The pictures u see on the website r not what it truly looks like! Be very aware!","Seriously this place urgently need to fix and maintenance. The most uncomfortable place that I ever stayed. Not worth with the price (finally I moved to the other place with the same price but got much better comfort and clean), honestly in my opinion this place is not ready for rent not as what they show on website.
Refer from the picture I shared, the wall has peel off. The ceiling has rust and dirty also when its raining you can see the water drop from ceiling
Toilet was dirty. The place look creepy and lack of maintenance.
The receptionist (man) not too professional to handle our request. The lady who process check-in for us on 27th June 2023 (around 2pm) is super not friendly.

And I suggest to find other Laundry service rather than those on the 1st fl near lobby is not clean, you can find other place better in nearby area

Not recommended at all.
Agoda doesn't give proper details at all. It was very pathetic and disappointing.

Starting with the good things: the location is ok if you do not need in the touristic center of Denpasar

Breakfast was ok ish, only a few options and a very awful coffee

BUT

I had an apartment, which was really out of a good shape, everything used, sometimes not working, dusty, really bad

But the most annoying thing: some areas of the apartment (i.e. the doors, the living room, the toilet) had only a ceiling height of 1.70m... I am almost 1.90m. so I had to bend a lot of times or get my head bumped... Bad, really bad!!"

Highlight: Omelette/telur dadar (crispy, just like telur barendo in famous Padang restaurant for a quarter of its price), jamu (both Kunyit Asem and Beras Kencur are thick and fresh).

There's also several swings where kids can play while waiting for the food.","What a hidden gem in Denpasar! There is a variety of local foods like soto, rawon, lodeh, nasi campur, many types of gorengan and vegetables. It is self service, so we can choose and plate our food, and even prepare our own drinks (tea, coffee). The atmosphere is traditional with the joglo house, wooden tables and chairs and rice fields around. The stuff is super friendly and attentive, and the price is fair. 100% recommended especially for people that love Javanese food and culture!","I had the pleasure of dining at this traditional restaurant in Indonesia and it was truly an amazing experience! The restaurant is located in the midst of beautiful rice fields, providing a stunning backdrop for my meal.

The menu featured a variety of dishes that are unique to Java and truly representative of the local culture.

The restaurant itself was also beautifully decorated, with traditional Javanese art and architecture adding to the ambiance. The staff were friendly and attentive, ensuring that my dining experience was perfect from start to finish.

For starters the room itself was not in a good state at all!

‚Ä¢There were stains on the bed and pillows

‚Ä¢Holes in the ceiling and dust everywhere

‚Ä¢The bathroom was disgusting; Limescale build-up EVERYWHERE, the shower heads looked revolting.

It's safe to say we did not shower!

‚Ä¢The mirror was broken, stained and dirty.

‚Ä¢The tap in the sink and toilet roll holder were completely rusty. Leaving rust on the actual toilet roll!

‚Ä¢The windows rattle very loudly with even the slightest of wind

Before we even stepped foot into the property:

As soon as we got to the property we saw a ramp and stairs that were separate, because we had large suitcases we opted for the ramp, as soon as my friend started to walk up the ramp she almost fell flat on her face due to how slippy the surface is and lack of grip on the ramp (it was like trying to walk on ice up hill)- due to it being a shiny granite material. Our nice grab driver offered to help and after falling over himself, got to the top of the ramp. We then tried opening the door and it wasn't opening. I knocked on the glass door several times as there were people inside (They ignored us at first!) Finally a person just kept pointing to the steps and implying to go around, instead of just opening the door in Which we were at! This required going back down the slippery ramp then up the stairs. So my friend had to lay her suitcase down and pushed it, because of how slippy the ramp was it flew down with speed.

Then to top it off there were kids screaming like crazy running up and down the halls for hours, stomping about and trying to open our door! Not once did the parents tell them to quieten down. It's not other people's responsibility to tell other people's kids to be respectful! We had been up the entire night previous travelling and we couldn't get any proper rest during the afternoon and evening because of this, despite being absolutely shattered.

We honestly thought about leaving as soon as we entered the room but didn't have the energy to do so!

Overall a terrible experience and would NOT recommend this place to ANYONE!

The only take away from this is to make sure to look at every review on several sites! Just look at the pictures, it's so bad - We have stayed at much cheaper places in several different locations and they were much nicer in every single way!","Very disappointed with Princess Keisha Hotel. Even though the booking was confirmed, the hotel suddenly canceled it because it received another booking and without prior valid notification. Worse yet, they refused to give a refund. Ignoring customer reservations is unacceptable. I strongly advise potential guests to reconsider booking at this hotel, as their disregard for confirmed reservations reflects poorly on their professionalism and customer service. They have wasted my time and money","good, but when I stayed there were being repaired in several rooms and in my room the cable TV facilities were having problems.","Why they didn't put Syariah in their name?
Hahahaü§£ It wasn't but today it is.

Lobby bau rokok, panas, basement berdebu. Kamar kotor, lampu redup, kamar  mandi bau. Just no. No comment, scam.","The rooms we had were infested in roach (prolly because one of the drainage in the cr was open)
However they sealed it off and no more roach after

The wifi was fast compared to other places as well~!

The service was nice because if you request for something, they would provide it instantly~!

Too bad our room only had table lamps so it was kinda dark (even though they have 3 table lamps)

Parking area is adequate, staff are super friendly (service with a smile is always a winner), dining area is nice and clean as well as the restroom, service timing from ordering to delivery at the table were prompt, food were super delicious and big kudos to the bartender guy, I rarely satisfied when ordering cocktail in this kind of place, but since the first cocktail was made appropriately to my expectation I ordered another one which was also met my expectation. If you are reading my review, come here! even if you don't have kids you would still enjoy it, even if you are one of those people who hate kids, choose a table near the entrance, it is well away from kids pool and the playground.

The food was served quite fast. And the pizzas and coolers were all delicious, the flavours were amazing and fresh.

Situated in prime location, can stop on the way or while coming back.","They have promo package 1 drink + 1 meal only 35k. üí∏
Sometimes i had lunch at others pizza hut but went to this place i ordered ""Fettuccine"" But the tasted wasn't creamy ü•∫ not tasty
However, the staffs are friendly and also the parking is big.",This place has better design than other Pizza hut I've visited around Denpasar. It is a bit small and kinda packed in terms of design and also when they are full but the place is great and bright too from natural light during the day.  Also provided for guest praying area and wushu area. This place almost always packed during eating time so better prepared or come when it's not lunch or dinner time.,"Really like the restaurant atmosphere. The lighting inside room dining was very good. The place was also very clean and comfortable. The staff was really helpful, friendly and loving children. However the waiter needed to talk a bit louder and be more informative. There was a special discount package for children to take a role in making pizza though it was just to spread any kind of pizza topping on the pizza dough on the table. Food was ok and overall service  was outstanding."

I don't mind to pay replacement, but it's feels not pleasant coz the cashier doesn't even care about the ruin food n drink. She doesn't said anything or offer just to shows human care.

The regular size ramen is kids portion, over price for me. Since i expecting by the price we can get a real ramen experience. There's no way I'm gonna order it again.",nice place with large parking area. service so fast. original taste.,"Ordered from Grab. Hokben Malboro. Very mediocre taste, low quality ingredients.

I kept kn hissing while eating it. I just don‚Äôt like the string bean lalapan. Taste bitter for me not unless you cut it small and pair it with rice and chicken with the tempong.

Because I really liked it, I went to dine in here. The service was great! They just forgot to serve my bebek, but its all good since I‚Äôm full from the ayam already. I was disappointed with the taste, it was never the same with the one on grab. However it still taste good, however the grab one was better.","The food is tastly (ayam bakar), I ate here twice but unfortunately I always had stomachache after having meals here (Im used into local meals though). I was not sure it was from the water I ordered (hot tea) or the dish. The cleanliness could be better.",The food is tasty but the size compare to price.

It's just a bit hot for me because the temperature of the place follows the outdoor temperature.,"Enough and last time here. The place is very crowded like the market at Saturday night, so it's not cozy. Service with a regular menu can be very long. The menus are normal, nothing special. Do not accept debit payments. Bad thing happened to my friend here, his helmet was missing here even though there was a parking guard.","This place is spacious and located by the river-side, suitable for youngsters (even the so-called youngsters), and the free wi-fi hunter only, as this place is too noisy both the crowds and the music.

Please check the weather forecast before you decided to came here, there could be a downpour outside or even a drip from the roof leakage inside here.

For the one who sought for a manual-brew coffee, unfortunately this place won't really suits you, unless if you would like to try Espresso, Ancient Coffee, or their so-called popular Es Kopi John which tasted bland and insipid.
Please bear in mind that inspite of waiting for anyone to take your order, it's better to write down your seating number & your order alone in a piece of paper and passed it to any nearby waiters, as there should be a long queue, or even worst to come out   that the waiter have forgotten your order on the next 30 minutes.
The seatings is not in sequences which caused the order going to be taken too slow by the waiters. Come in a small group is suggested.
Just in case you have to excuse yourself, remember to bring your own kleenex, and mind your step as the loo is nasty.

The cashiers are another problem here, bad in both service and attitude, leaving a further bad impression, as if they don't need business here.
Please remember what you have ordered earlier to avoid any miscalculation in your bill. It's cash-only here, and park at your own risk, although it's not a free-parking.

IMHO, this place is biased and vague.","Was surprised but actually love this place. Big sprawling open sided building right next to the river. Big off road parking area. Rustic is an understatement!!!! Very basic & functional. REALLY cheap menu - hence why it's busy full of young locals!!! Food quality & taste was good, cooked fresh to order so no complaints."
