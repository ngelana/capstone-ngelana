ChIJr7WSq9lz0i0RMKZQnMYjL38,Bukit Keker Cottage,-8.682618699999999,115.49386489999998,"Nusa Penida, Jl. Bukit Keker, Banjar Nyuh, 8F8V+XG5, Ped, Kec. Nusa Penida, Kabupaten Klungkung, Bali 80771, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=9164583102655276592,OPERATIONAL,,,lodging,4.9,70,,"The room is spacious, the bed is very comfortable, there is air conditioning too, so you can sleep comfortably. The bathroom is very spacious and has hot and cold water facilities. the view from inside the room is amazing, you can see clearly Mount Agung and Batur. the next plus point is that it is very close to the Nyuh village port, so you don't have to worry about being late to the port","One of my favorite places on the island. Clean comfy room, nice mount Agung view, friendly and respectful staff. They provide us the bike rent and transfer. The WiFi is not good everywhere on the island, because there is no cable from mainland, you just have to be ready for that. You cannot do the video calls, but it is enough to do the routine.","Amazing place. Beautiful nature view, very peaceful and rooms are clean and modern. No mosquitos, and lovely birdsong all around. Hot shower has good pressure, wifi is good and most importantly, Komang and his wife are the loveliest hosts. Breakfast here is simple and really yummy, and dinner is home cooked and superb. They don’t speak a lot of English but they really go out of their way to make you comfortable. This is one of our favourite stays in Indonesia - just a ton of heart, and very lovely place.

Komang actually built the beautiful lodge (including the furniture in the dining area) with his dad from materials they found on Nusa Penida. The lodge was built so they could support their local social enterprise, the learning centre. The learning centre (just behind the lodge - you definitely should go visit!) is a not for profit organisation that Komang and his brothers set up to preserve local culture. Young people from the villages in Nusa Penida go there to learn traditional music, dance and language. It’s a bedrock of the local community and the earnings from the lodge go towards supporting it. It’s grassroots eco-tourism at its best. It also explains why Bukit Keker has so much heart - because it’s been built from the hopes of supporting and uplifting the local community. Highly recommended!!","Very nice clean and cozy place in Nusa Penida with a nice view on Bali's volcanoes. The staff is very kind and professional, always available to help.","The view, the silence, the sounds of the birds and the gentle service of Wayan"
