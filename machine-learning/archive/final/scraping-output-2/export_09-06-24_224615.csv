My room also was cleaned. Watching sunrise is good option for mornings. Food is average but good enough.",I would highly recommend Kubu Indah. The staff are exceptional. Beautiful people and so helpful. The ladies in the reception helped with anything we needed. The gardens and pool area is amazing. Much better than where our friends were staying down the road at another resort that was more expensive. The food and service at the bar and restaurant was spot on. Everything about our stay here was exceptional.,"This place was stunning. It feels like an oasis when you arrive. Our room was immaculate, with great air-conditioning. The food was also good, and we spent most of our time relaxing by the beautiful infinity pool. You have to pay for everything though, and it's not necessarily cheap (hiring snorkels for a day is about $119.000Rp per person, and drinks were all on the expensive side). But the experience was so relaxing and felt very luxurious. There's not much to do around the resort, but it was really nice to unwind here for a few days in the middle of our action packed holiday.","It is a vey beautiful spot to stay. The resort is beautiful. The staff are superb, so friendly and helpful just can't say enough about them.
The dive shop however is expensive, it is massively over priced in comparison with other dive shops. There are far better options for dive shops.
We dived with ""Let's dive Tulamben"" we had 2 dives with full gear, an absolutely fantastic guide for less than the price of one dive here.","Hello,
All in all a good hotel with a very nice staff.
But please put less chlorine into the pool!!! Every night they put new chlorine (a lot) into the pool.
The hair feels completely dry after going inside the pool. Also not good for your skin."

Best place to stay near AMED in our opinion.
It’s a blessing that we could stay in this paradise. Please if you go take care of the people and the beautiful place. It is like home.

The food is more than delicious and freshly made. The hosts and employees are the kindest you will ever meet, and will go beyond for your needs and wishes.

We are definitely coming back.

❤️❤️❤️","If you are looking for a beachfront,  serene & peaceful stay with a big bonus of delicious food, Villa Toraja Baturinggit is the place. We stayed here for 2 nights. The place is facing the ocean, huge and beautiful. The owners and the staff are friendly and respectful. The place is a bit far from restaurants but we don't mind as Kak Chery (the owner) and the staff served us delicious and fresh home cooked dinner.","A pleasant villa to spend vacation with friends and family, it has clean and comfortable rooms.
Surrounding by a nice garden and a magical view of the Bali Sea.
The owner is very friendly and she can provide the best service for the guests. We enjoy our time while staying there!!","I would definitely recommend this perfect accommodation  to anyone visiting Bali. Location, location, location! This stunning place is perfect for anyone who wants to be located right by the ocean, in the heart of the beautiful garden but doesn’t want to stay in yet another hotel room. Excellent communication with the owners who were waiting for us upon arrival. Dalibor and his beautiful wife Chery took great care of us. All food we had in their family restaurant cooked by Chery was absolutely splendid. Massages in the garden by the pool with a romantic sunset above the ocean,...perfectly organised trips...what shall I say?.. Heaven on earth. Go ahead and book your stay.","Beautiful retreat inside lovely (nearly botanical) garden which is rightly the owner's sake. Beachfront position is perfect for whatching sunrise over Rinjani or dolphins. Accommodation in nice cottages is pleasant, cleanless is perfect. The beach is stony but there is large swimming pool in the garden.You can choose tasty eating and drinking in the new restaurant .Roughly speaking, perfect place to retreat Your body and soul."
