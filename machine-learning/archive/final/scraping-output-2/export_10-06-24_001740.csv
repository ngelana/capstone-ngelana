The room's unique design adds to its charm, and the owner and his family are incredibly friendly and helpful. They provided delicious meals and even went the extra mile by giving me a headlight and a takeaway breakfast before my trip to Mount Agung. They also assisted me in planning my further travels.
If you plan to hike Mount Agung from here, please be aware that some roads there may be in poor condition, so plan accordingly.
All in all, my stay at Wikan House was fantastic, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a welcoming and memorable experience.","Wikan House is an amazing place to stay.

The family  is very nice and warm and the breakfast is delicious. The toilet is outside and no heater, buy these are not big concern for me.
