Every aspect of my experience was superior to any resort I have ever visited.  There are so many unique characteristics of this resort that it is impossible to mention them all.  What is felt immediately upon arrival is the kind and caring staff's attention to every detail.  I can't wait to return!,"Zen Resort Bali is a paradise on earth.
I felt like home since the first second I arrived.
I found more peace, calmness and happiness. The yoga lessons and meditations hours were very good and always guided.
Zen Resort is a place to relaxe and find your inner peace. The
ayurvedic healthy treatments helps me to coming well. The ladys in the spa were very good and always kind and lovely.
The treatments are indiviually for everybody to go wellcoming.
Also the food was very delicous and also very good for me as a vegan.
All workers in the Resort are helpfully, kind and very very friendly.
A very special thing there is the creativity with many flowers it was fantasic to see this wonderful buildings everywhere on the floor or on the tabel like in a dream.

I say soo much thank you to all of you I will never forget you what you did to me to find myself and go wellcoming.

I LOVE ZEN RESORT BALI.

Om swastiastu‚ù§Ô∏èüå∏üïä",I stayed at the Zen resort for four nights to do my PADI advanced course. These five days were absolutely amazing. The staff at the Zen resort is extraordinary and does everything to make your stay unforgettable. I felt really great after these five days and would highly recommend this resort if you are looking for a beautiful resort away from the touristic parts of Bali.,"I stayed nearly 3 weeks at Zen Resort and enjoyed every minute. The resort offers an amazing carefree package. I would like to highlight the great food, the treatments with the well trained therapists, the spacious and clean rooms, the yoga and meditation sessions and the beautiful garden! I also did my Open Water Diver Certificate with Arnaud who is amazingly experienced. Overall I would like to say that the whole Zen staff was above all expectations. Their biggest goal is to make your stay a memory for a lifetime. And they achieved! I can recommend it 100%","I stayed at Zen Resort for 5 days during my Easter Break: I arrived here by chance, when I found this resort online something told me to simply book it and go! Best decision ever!

The resort itself is calm and quite, the perfect place where to switch off everything and just relax. I personally booked the package including diving activities: my days where well organised between yoga, meditation, diving and some Ayurveda treatments. Days passed by even too quickly, but thanks to the guidance and attention of the whole staff, any tiny bit of them worth deeply and thought me something. The diving sites (Tulamben and Menjangan Island) were wonderful: I appreciate the resort scheduling the fives very early in the morning when sites are not too busy.

The bedrooms are amazing and super clean, with a porch where to relax in the front and signature outdoor shower on the back. Everyday the efficient staff cleans the room, add fresh flowers all around it and replenish the incense.
The restaurant cooks delicious food following the Ayurveda principles using fresh fruits from the forest.
To me, what makes this place truly special is the spirituality and the huge energy that it emanates: whichever is the reason that brought you there, in some way you will leave the place healed."

Nibbana has been a bustling resort on the past and is struggling to restart.
The location is out of town and is lovely and peaceful with stunning sea views. The rooms were spotless and staff welcoming and friendly.","Great experience staying here, the room is clean & hygiene, lovely and helpful staff but most importantly pet friendly hotel!

Perfect for those you are looking for a remote & quiet place to stay in North Bali. Great view from the infinity pool looking rice paddy fields straight to the seas, great sunrise spot for sure.

Breakfast was adequate, considering the affordable price, you can use the bicycles there for free if you want to ride down hill to the beach (5mins away), Wi-Fi was on and off, but not a big deal.

Would live to stay here again!","This hotel is located 20 mins from Lovina. It is a nice place if you want to have a break after Munduk (we stayed here because we went to Pemuteran and after to Batur).
The place is amazing, very wide with several rooms which look like little house, a garden and a big infinity pool with a view over the valley and rice terraces.
The rooms are nice but lack of classic and handy equipment. Beware of asking to the hotel before arriving (hair dryer or payement by card).
You can rent scooter as well and there is someone who can drive you for a decent price (we went to Batur after).
If you are in the area and need to stay in a place in the north of Bali, I recommend to go to The Bali Nibbana Resort !","Peaceful lovely staff reasonable price compared to that of other villas close by.beaytiful view from the swimming pool at rear of property including the fantastic sun rise at 6am as it is facing east
Only 10 minute walk to beach
Very clean large rooms and bathrooms plenty hot water in shower and supplies toiletries.
Restaurant menu is not big in variety but delicious  could do with more choices for a long stay.motor bike hire available at front office 100ooo rp per day $10 au.
Gardens are beautiful and well cared for.local people are friendly helps a lot if you learn some basic Indonesian to break the barrier.
Over all very comfortable built in Balinese style not as plush as some of the close by villas built by foreigners but not as expensive   either.If your not into the kuta scene you will love it here lots of nice temples and scenery and nice quiet beaches.
Easily  four star","Lovely place, clean, beautiful garden and Friendly staff. The view from the swimming pool is Amazing !"
