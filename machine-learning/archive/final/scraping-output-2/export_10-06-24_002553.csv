From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by Ali, who enthusiastically showed us around the stunning interior and design of the villa. Without us even needing to ask, he took all the time to give us a tour and answer all our questions. The view was breathtaking, and the cabins were perfectly designed, down to the smallest detail. We have never seen such a perfect place. Our stay at Bamboo Villa was an experience we will never forget. Thanks to Ali and the team for their hospitality and dedication.

We can't wait to return!","this place is magical and we highly recommend! during our stay here we felt peaceful and playful living up in the trees above a beautiful serene village, with sounds of river, wind, temple, birds, and a  gentle rain. Service was perfect, including massage overlooking our view and delicious food and beverage at every request. we will tell all our friends to come see for themselves! our driver Ketut was the best and guided us to an off the beaten path waterfall hike.","Wonderful villa experience

Will drain your phone battery after taking 2000 photos because of the views. Amazing and breathtaking.

Service from staff is top notch professional and begins before check-in.

Well worth the cost for privacy as didn't hear and can't see any guests while staying due to how the villa is situated.

Bonus points for sending jewelry left behind in mail.

Thanks again, to staff from Avana for your service. And especially Ali for your hospitality on checking in.","Im a super scared of insects so I was very hesitant when I booked this villa. Im happy to report that it was perfectly fine!

The view is even better than photos. One rare feature about this villa is that it can be enjoyed even when it is raining. The outdoor chilling areas are all covered so you are protected from both the sun and rain. Our previous villa was much bigger but we were stuck indoors because of rain.

I recommend two nights since it's a long way to get here. With day trips minimum 3 nights. Both the romance package and cooking class experience are must do's! The food was better than tasting menus we had at 5 star hotels - all thanks to the super talented Chef Lanang!

Also we want to thank everyone in Avana for such a perfect stay.
This starts with Ali and Edi who were  super patient and responsive. Sumerta, Galung, and Kadek dharmayanti all executed everything perfectly. Their driver Ketut Supry is so knowledgeable and such a joy to chat with - we learned so much from him! We can't thank everyone enough!",My love and I stayed here for 4 nights and celebrated my birthday here. We stayed in the 'Curved Villa'. It was amazing. The friendly staff. Tha bamboo architecture. The design. The pool. The floating breakfast. Massages in the villa. Great food. The flower bath. Breathtaking views. Cliff. Vulcan mountain. Rice fields. The ocean. I'd recommend this to anyone.
