A hidden gem in Jatiluwih area. Quite a hike up to find this place. I would suggest going by motorbike instead. Grab some warm instant noodles after your time on the River from the nearby Warung Rhindu. The lady working there is extremely nice and I rented the tube from her . Paid IDR 25,000 for one round of 15min fun.",This place was awesome and for sure a hidden gem. We did 4 runs and had some fried noddles after.,"Spectacular view of rice field and Batukaru mountain with super fun experience in the river. Rented river tube  for 10k, had some coffees and noodles at Pak Eka Warung Rindu who was very friendly and helpful üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº We will go back there again for camping!!","Now this is a hidden gem! Such a unique nature experience. The road is still under developed, hard to reach by car, but not impossible. There is no entrance ticket, just donation of minimum 5k, then rent a tube for 10k. You'll float on the tube on a slow-flowing river for about 30 mins. Afterwards, you can get some tea/coffee and indomie to warm up your body.",the most playful vacation we've ever had

GPS took me to temple. I turned around and went back down hill, turned left over bridge, then first left after crossing bridge. Road says Crystal on sign. Drove up and paid 10k for admission. They said 10 or 20k. Donation. I then drove my car along concrete road/path. Just wide enough for car. Place to park car by statue. Then path to waterfall marked. Not a long walk. Steps down to base of waterfall slippery. There are holding rails part of the way down. Not big waterfall but sounds loud. Nice walk through ricefields getting there.","It‚Äôs a beautiful hidden waterfall where you have to reach it with a fascinating walk through scenic path of vast rice terraces and amazing view over the central mountain range of Bali. It‚Äôs not really a high waterfall but it‚Äôs truly beautiful, especially the serenity and quietness of the place. Not too many visitors which is great to be there to enjoy it yourself. We visited the place after Covid-19 so the trail and steps down to the waterfall was a little bit out of maintenance so got to be careful.","It is now far from Jatiluwih. As i know people are not allowed to swim. You need to walk down slowly, you can see people try to improve the walk pathway. I recommend you to bring a cap or an umbrella, it is hot on the top before walking down.","One of Hindu's temple located at Babahan Village, Penebel, Tabanan regency.","This pin is not the waterfall. We got lost using this pin walking in from the north.
Air Terjun Besikalung is the location of track down to falls. The falls are amazing when we found them."

There's also 'Dana Punia' (donation) post at the entrance.
Cons: challenging road to reach the property, better use motorbike. If you want to use a car, the road has been recently resurfaced with concrete but only fit for one car. Twisty road makes it difficult for longer car to manouvre, but doable. Parking area available for 3 cars.","It is a small warung runs by a hardworking family. The wife is able to cook us a wonderful lunch, we ordered nasi goreng bali and fern vegetable. The wife made them very well. If you wish to eat nasi goreng with balinese spices, you should try this one, excellent . Pak Eka, the owner also runs inner tube to float down to the river business.
