There is a perfect view of the forest from your private balcony. The surroundings are either beautiful rice fields, or a stunning forest. Near our balcony, some squirrels ran occasionally, felt very close to nature.
The room is wooden, and the bed is comfortable. There are not too many bugs and mosquitoes, especially considering the close distance to nature. There is a beautiful shared pool and a SPA at the hotel.
The Staff is very friendly and caring.
The only few things you should consider are:
The place is not that close to the city, so if you like city buzz, you will have to drive by a bike some 30 min to Ubud
We stayed at level 7, and it takes many stairs to get up to the reception/ entrance/ parking lot. If you are in a bad physical condition, ask hotel to give you a room closer to the reception, so you wouldn't have to climb up
As the hotel is not close to city center, food delivery is possible, but limited;
There is a restaurant at the hotel and room service is available, however, the dishes are not the greatest.","The staff here have been fantastic! Super friendly and very helpful. They upgraded our suite to one of the villas with a private pool and we couldn't be happier with it. Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a quite stay, surrounded by tropical rainforest. Plenty of waterfalls in walking distance, the locals around town are very friendly. Perfect for a low key getaway","Amazing Place and Amazing Stay, this is the best place to stay in Ubud and the staff is really great in taking care of us and always helpful to us. Rooms were clean and cleaned everyday

We were able to setup a date night in our room with amazing room service and private villa with our private pool.

Amazing Service and Amazing Staff. Especially Egi Adelia, who was always available for us with a smile.

The spa service in the hotel was also amazing, i highly recommended to use it, 2 hours will go by and you will feel refreshed and rejuvenated.","Great place to stay and relax. We were a family of 3 to stayed in 1 bedroom villa with private pool.
The staffs were amazing. They all were eager to assist.  The staff especially Sapitri and Egi were extremely friendly and helpful.
location is amazing with the surrounding area full of natural beauty.
The pool area has the most amazing view and my son enjoyed a lot.

I would recommend everyone if you are travelling to Bali ubud.
10/10
Love from Dangal family ❤️❤️❤️ we miss you girls❤️","I’m fully recommending this place. Room was clean and well prepared, room service was nice and helpful, food was tasty. We definitely come back next time. Hotel meets our expectations."

The rooms were fantastic, the service and hospitality were really so wonderful. Quiet, gorgeous views, private pool and outside seating area.  We had breakfast every morning and it was delicious!!! I couldn’t recommend Sebatu Tulen Villas more.  I will stay there again in a moment!  Truly wonderful!","Great hotel, I highly recommend it to everyone!  This was my fifth hotel in Bali and it was definitely the best.  All cottages have a private pool and sun loungers overlooking a small rice field.  Wooden houses, which make you feel like you are in the forest, but at the same time a very comfortable large bed with mosquito nets.  The bathroom looks like an expensive spa.  Breakfasts are served on the terrace of the house, so you can enjoy your food in peace and quiet in the bosom of nature.  The service is always smiling and very helpful.  It was definitely a great vacation, 10/10!","Amazing views, service and facilities!
We loved every minute of our stay, the best hotel for us in Bali","Lovely small and quiet hotel with an excellent service, nice pools (private and public) and good breakfast!  They offer good information and nice tours. We did the mount batur tour, I really can recommend (if you have enough condition)!

Nice view on some rice fields and the beautiful nature of Bali. Very helpful and nice staff! Hope to see you again next time in Bali!","Extremely recommendable. Luxury apartments with infinity pool in the middle of nature. Very nice view to rice fields and palm trees. The complex with 5 apartments is very well maintained. The water in the bath and shower (hot and cold) is of high quality (absolutely drinkable like). The service is also great: Renting a scooter, getting food, drinks, juices - everything no problem.  Hopefully we'll be back."

The nights do get loud with the noises from the insects/geckos but that’s to be expected when you stay somewhere remote. The room was lovely and a perfect place to relax, the plunge pool was a great addition and let us cool off after a long day exploring.","I booked a private villa with a plunge pool. I thought it was near the monkey forest in Ubud as per a google search but that was a different place (same name). This place is 45 mins away from Ubud town centre. It ended up being a good mistake on my behalf as it was so nice to stay in a remote location away from the hustle and bustle. They have scooters for rent so we hired one each and rode to waterfalls and temples. It was amazing. We had dinner at the resort across the road and it was absolutely amazing, also had an awesome massage at Bares spa which is walking distance. The breakfast was delicious.
The room/villa was so beautiful and romantic. They have a beautiful big hot tub that easily fits two people.
The air-conditioning in the room didn't work very well so we were a bit hot trying to sleep but it wasn't much of a big deal.
Overall it was an amazing place to stay, we were there two nights and wish we could have stayed longer. The staff were wonderful. The location amongst the rice fields was beautiful. Just be aware that it is a remote location but with that you get peace and serenity and you can still easily arrange transport or rent scooters and go and adventure as there are many amazing places to see close by. I highly recommend this place","Didn’t stay here, just had a dinner, staffs are very kind, food is great, entertainment was amazing, on a suggestion maybe entertainers can turn around bit, since there’s tables all around.",This resort is a definitely must visit if you're in the area great restaurant within. Very friendly staff with a superior service. Live performances and so much more

From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with great hospitality.

The location of the Bamboo Pod is simply breathtaking. Nestled in a natural setting of unparalleled beauty, with a panoramic view of the terraced rice fields and an atmosphere of absolute tranquility. The Bamboo Pod itself was incredibly comfortable, providing a cozy retreat.

The natural pool with its hundreds of fish was truly surprising. It offered a unique and refreshing experience, surrounded by the soothing sounds of nature.

Finally, the cuisine offered at the establishment's restaurant is simply exquisite.The Granola Bowl at breakfast was so delicious.",What a beautiful place! Completely disengaged from the busy bali feeling. The food is delicious and the safari tent was amazing from start to finish. So many details which made the experience complete.,"What a beautiful place to stay in Ubud!! Our favourite stay during our one-month trip to Bali. Simply breathtaking views and surrounding area. We stayed in The Bamboo Pod and wow, what a magical place to stay. It's two-tiered so you get both downstairs and upstairs space which is great! The view (especially in the morning at sunrise) is phenomenal.
We ate lunch & dinner there and both times they were delicious, and we also tried their cookies in the reception area and they are some of the tastiest cookies I've ever had!
The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly and we went on a beautiful morning picnic - our guide was very insightful and friendly!
Overall, a very magical experience that you should experience at least once in your life - I know I will be going back the next time I come to Bali as I would like to stay in the Safari tent too!","We recently stayed at the Sebatu Sanctuary Eco Resort, and we were amazed by the beautiful surroundings and the variety of different types of villas available. We appreciated the opportunity to choose from so many unique and stunning options, each with its own charm and character.

One of the highlights of the resort was the natural pool, which is created by the river and surrounded by lush greenery. We loved the experience of swimming in the refreshing water while surrounded by nature.

The food at the resort was truly outstanding and some of the best we've had during our time in Bali. We particularly enjoyed the vegan and vegetarian options, which were both plentiful and delicious. The fact that the food was also very inexpensive was an added bonus.

Overall, we felt that the Sebatu Sanctuary Eco Resort was a great value for the quality of the accommodations, the outstanding food, and the beautiful natural surroundings. We would highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for a peaceful and eco-friendly retreat in Bali.","I chanced upon this location as I was looking for something away from the city and also to have a soul retreat. Sebatu Sanctuary Eco-resort definitely lived up to it's name and reviews.

I was ""greeted"" by the staff promptly upon making my deposit via online and was sent a guide to attractions and the services that Sebatu Sanctuary was able to provide. They also offered to do a airport transfer for me to ensure that I am able to get to the accomodation without any hiccups. Kudos on that.

As we were arriving after 10pm, I had also requested for dinner in advance as their kitchen would be closed by then. A thoughtful recommendation was suggested for me to go with their fried rice to ensure that the food could be easily heated up, definitely, the food is of high quality and tasted delicious.

We chose the Safari Tentage accomodation which is also a highly recommended to try for all who have not visited it. The description on their website is accurate and not forgetting to highlight that it is deeper into the ""valley"", the temperature is lower and makes it a good place to snuggle in and enjoy nature.

Early mornings couldn't be better as we were greeted with birds chirping and cicadas' ASMR wake up call. It is the best you can get for a substitute of the Alarm. We allow ourselves to sleep in and let the nature do the talking, it couldn't be more rejuvenating than that coming from the point of view of a city dweller.

A little something to highlight, I really like the concept of living with nature which is what was shared by Alex ( Sebatu's Sanctuary Owner). This means that the place was built around nature with as little as possible done to change the landscape other than the cemented foundations. Having stayed there, I learnt that Eco-tourism do exist as it can provide jobs for the people and yet live in peace with the surroundings.

This is definitely not for the faint hearted as well as nature would mean cicadas, frogs and any living creatures that lived there before the place was built. We are only temporarily sharing the place with them.

We also had a chance to try the bamboo treehouse for a different experience. This is thanks to Sebatu Sanctuary's staff and Alex for arranging so. Thanks once again. It was indeed an eye opener and 2 experience within our 1 week there.

Not forgetting to thank the staff and chef. We have to say the delicacies served in our accommodation is not only of high quality, the taste is impeccable and one of the best we had in Bali. We enjoyed so much that we spent 90% of our dinner time there and tried almost 80% of the menu.

I would highly recommend this place for everyone as the warmth of the staff makes one feel at home. It is also a good getaway to slow down the pace of life and do some deep reflections.

I thank all members at Sebatu Sanctuary for making our stay delightful once again. We will definitely visit again.

P.S. The Vintage Kombi is a must go if I were to say. Brought to a local spot for picnic with tour guide of the place makes it a unique experience for us."

There are only four rooms on the premises so it felt really cozy. The family suite was huge and even had a kitchen. The interiors were beautiful, although there were occasional insects and critters—which is expected as it is located in the jungle. It is a little far from Ubud center (30-40 minutes), but we liked the location as it was close to the elephant sanctuary and waterfalls. We also used their laundry service for 20k rupiah and got it the next day. The staff were so kind. My boyfriend forgot something after we checked out and they checked the room multiple times and found it!","Quiet little paradise, rooms are hidden in between the vegetation, you feel like in the middle of the jungle. Staff were really nice and friendly, close to local restaurants or fancy ones if it’s what you’re looking for. We stayed 2 nights. A getaway from touristy places, we loved it !","Sweet little oasis. Friendly staff, clean, quiet enough during the day. A.C. super effective. Local cat ""Agent K""( we named lol) is adorable and will want some of your food, very persistent. Food is few minutes walk up the road, two restaurants that we found. Probably best ordering your own rides, hotel rides bit more $. 10ish minute moped ride from main strip, where you can get whatever. We got the bigger room, glad we did to. One building has to rooms divided by a false wall... Overall pretty nice spot","We had an amazing experience at the Umah Tis Sebatu! The breathtaking views, luxurious amenities, and impeccable service made our stay unforgettable. The well-equipped kitchen and dining area allowed us to savor delicious meals together. Every detail, from the spacious rooms to the beautiful pool, exceeded my expectations. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, ensuring a perfect getaway. I highly recommend this villa for an indulgent and relaxing retreat in Bali. Highly recommend 🫶⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","I stayed in Umah with my husband for 3 nights during our three week Indonesia vacation. Considering this was our most expensive stay during our trip, it totally failed our expectations. Numerous horrible experiences. I have shared all of them with the owner via Airbnb messenger and received a message back, but no apology or effort to fix anything.

1. I bit into a rock during our first night here for a dinner we paid for (pictured). Both dishes were not good.

2. The flower bath I ordered was cold water(pictured) . I ordered it on the app and specified I wanted it in the evening. Instead they made it before our check in time, and it was cold. They still took my money though!

3. This location is awful. It's so far away from everything and yet it's so noisy. They wanted to visit a nearby Shrine and we're going to hire a grab. However the reception clerk heard us talking and insisted that we hire one of his cars. Because he said if we hire his car it will drive us back to our hotel. It was more expensive and we had to wait an additional 30 minutes in the lobby but we agreed. However when we got to the shrine our taxi abandoned us. And the hotel desk clerk said he didn't tell us that and it was not his fault. We were literally stranded in a village because of the clerk and had to ask locals for a car ride.

4. I understand English is difficult but your staff was the most difficult to communicate with during our entire three weeks.

5. I ordered floating breakfast (pictured) my husband and I were in revealing swimwear and one of the workers came over and started photographing us without our consent! I'm in a bikini and I don't want to be posted on the internet without my own permission. He wouldn't stop.

The hotel room we booked was the most expensive one on site so it was pretty but I wanted to get out of here so bad."

I must say that this restaurant was by far the BEST in Bali we've ever been. Super friendly staff and yummy food. Our favorites were Pad Kao Pao, Balinese grilled chicken among others. Homemade juices were very tasty and fresh. The chocolate lava cake is must try, which was not only the best one i've eaten in Bali, but probably the best dessert i've eaten in my life! Although i am a person who is not really into desserts, i was addicted to this cake. If you are in the neighborhood you must give a try to this restaurant."

Just that Care take wont be available after 8.30 pm till morning 7am which is a bit concern.
Since surrounded by trees and plants and rice fields, creatures like lizards can enter your room.","Pros:
- The villa and private pool is good.
- The room service guys are very friendly.
- Raka (or Haka. Don't remember his name clearly) who manages the property is very friendly and sweet and helped us with a lot of things.
Cons:
- The location is really bad.
- It's very hard to get a grab cab here since it's a very remote location.
- The roads are very curvy and uphill and it's a pain to travel to any of the tourist locations.
- You will not find any shops or ATMs in around 5 kms range.
- The room service is available only till 11pm and after that it's just you in the property all night in that remote location. You will feel unsafe there.
We had booked for 4 days here and we requested the management to shorten our stay by one night since we had an early flight the next day and it takes 2 hours to go to airport from this place. But they didn't agree for it which was very disappointing. They didn't take our concerns seriously. We had to leave the place early which was a loss for us plus we had to pay extra for a new booking in a better location.
Raka and the two room service guys are really great and they know how to treat customers. But very disappointed with the sales and marketing team who didn't care about our difficulties."
