unforgettable! The staff (especially Dedi) were incredibly friendly and accommodating, which made our stay really enjoyable. The location of the hotel is simply stunning - surrounded by tropical beauty and overlooking the sparkling ocean.

The activities offer were fantastic too! We enjoyed every moment of our stay and can highly recommend it - definitely one of the best hotels in Bali!","The best experience ever if you are visiting North Bali. Sunsets from the infinity pool is something you wouldn’t want to miss. The serene atmosphere is an add on. Also a big thanks to Mr. Gargita for taking such good care of us. He even helped us when we were stuck somewhere outside of hotel. The views, food, chilling atmosphere, hospitality everything is top notch. A must recommended place from our side.","I stayed here in the one bedroom villa with jacuzzi, and it was amazing! The views from down at the restaurant and infinity pool were stunning. My room was incredibly comfortable and cleaned twice a day. I had vegetarian meals which were delicious. The staff were wonderful and accomodating. There were lots of activities to do everyday, everything from bird watching, coffee plantation tours, yoga, dancing and bamboo straw making. I had a wonderfully peaceful time and absolutely loved it.","Easily one of the best stays in North Bali. Their infinity pool is really beautiful! no wonder they got an award for being one of the top 10 in the world. Amazed by the excellent hospitality and kudos to our personal butler, Leo. We felt super close to nature but at the same time, all the rooms were super clean. Don't forget to take a look at the various activities provided by the resort! I really enjoyed stargazing and the coffee plantation tour.","By far the most beautiful hotel I’ve been to. We had a dreamy villa surrounded by nature with a private pool and jacuzzi. Also, the hotel’s infinite pool was breathtaking. As for the staff, they were kind and helpful. The hotel has plenty of free activities for its guests and they are all very worthy. It’s the perfect hotel to disconnect from daily stress and reconnect with your inner self. Couldn’t recommend it more."

The views are incredible, comfy bed, clean bathroom and rooms and the breakfast is lovely. The owners are so nice and helpful they sorted everything for us and so friendly i couldnt recommend this place enough! 6 months travelling and one of our favourite places we stayed. Lots of gorgeous dogs too!","My boyfriend and me had two amazing days in BUGO Camp. The owner is really friendly and helped us to organise a motorbike for doing a day trip. The camping space is very well mentained, clean and our little house was comfortable and warm for the night. The view over the camping is beautiful and you can see all the way to the coast. We really enjoyed our time there, thanks a lot for everything! :))","This is a campsite with huts overlooking a steep valley and coastline beneath. You come to be detached, enjoy nature and experience the authentic humility of a local Balinese farming community. The host family are farmers and exceptional hosts.

You'll get a homemade breakfast cooked by the host's wife every morning. There is a five-star resort adjacent to the camp, so if you need a bit of luxury or a restaurant, thats an option there or you can try the warungs on the main road.

The main downside are the bathroom facilities - they're not quite up to scratch (even for a campsite), and the host is aware. He is trying to save money to build a new shared and improved bathroom facility. Just know that when you stay here you are supporting a local family.","Bugo Camp is a peace nest, made for people who want to connect with nature and themselves. The views are truly amazing and the site very relaxing and peaceful.
Ketut and his family will go out of their way to make you feel at home and provide for anything that you need. They all work very hard to keep the place clean and comfortable.
The free access to the next door resort’s pools and jacuzzi was the cherry on the top !
If you need to explore the area, you may rent a scooter from here or, ask Ketut to show you around. I don’t have a drivers licence so Ketut took me to all the waterfalls I wanted to see and to hot springs in one day in his car for a more than reasonable price (way cheaper than the ones given by tour companies).
Keep in mind that this is a camp in a natural environment designed for people who are comfortable in being in nature with whatever comes with it.",The cabin are quite confortable and the view is really beautiful. The only things are that we saw a cockroach inside and the bathroom had no hot water and wasn’t really clean but the environment is really worth it for a few nights. There is only 3 options to eat near by (2 warungs and a fastfood). We paid 364K for 2 nights including breakfast.

The ground's are peaceful and beautiful views over dinner. The staff were so helpful and kind and on hand to help at all times. The staff helped us get some laundry done and we enjoyed room service.  The food in the restaurant was delicious as was the breakfast, welcome drink and afternoon tea. We will not forget our honeymoon quickly. Munduk itself is gorgeous and peaceful. Not touristy at all.","We were really unlucky while in Munduk, it rained the majority of the time we were there so we couldn't make full use of the private plunge pool that came with our room.

This is great as a more affordable hotel to stay in if you cannot afford the prices of the Munduk Moding Plantation hotel (around half the price with your own private villa). The great thing is you can still get day passes to the plantation and spend the day there doing activities and eating at their restaurant, but there is a minimum spend. It is only an easy 5 minute walk between the two hotels.

Amazing views and definitely worth the visit if you also make use of the plantation right next door!","Had an amazing time here. The rooms are beautiful, especially the pool overlooking the mountains and the bath with a view out the window.
The staff are so friendly and made us feel welcome.
Highly recommend staying here on your trip to Munduk!","Munduk Tentrem is a brand new, beautiful and cozy resort located in a small village about 15 minutes from Munduk. It was by far the most expensive place we stayed in on Bali, but we got what we payed for. The rooms are fabulous and the team is eager to provide the best possible experience during your stay. The sunsets here are magnificent on a normal day, and beyond breath-taking when the weather is just right. With an unobstructed view of the mountains and the ocean all the way until Java. We enjoyed that same view from our room, bath, balcony and private outdoor tub.

The food, some of which is grown on the small organic farm, ranges from good to extraordinary. So lovely to enjoy perfect avocado's fresh from the tree right next to the restaurant. Next to the standard menu, there are a few three course menu's to choose from. None of those was vegetarian, but upon request we got a lovely alternative on our last night there.

Interestingly, there sometimes was a difference in quality between the same dish at different moments. always good, but sometimes exceptional. Perhaps due to a different kitchen staff? If we really have to name something to improve it would be the french fries, which were a little disappointing. Luckily there were plenty of other options though.

To top it off, the driver/guide suggested by the resort, Gede Yudi, was by far the nicest we had on the Island. All in all, definitely recommended.","very nice villa with amazing view, the temprature in Munduk Tentrem is also good for you to stay & relax, and the most impresive things the food is delicious and almost all of the menu have a great taste!

also they have organic farm plantion that very good for you who wants to bring your small kid to introduce to them how important life of organic plants.

i am absolutely satisfied to stay here in Munduk Tentrem 🫰😊"

Dont expect any 3rd wave coffee experience, however the coffee is wuite fine. We didn’t get to see the actual farm.","Awesome coffee plantation with processing and roasting unit, plus of course a bar and tasting place. Definitely recommend visiting and join their tour & tasting activity (350k, including a pack of coffee as well). You can also buy a variaty of beans here. Giry, the lead barista and guide is an awesome guy with huge amount of knowledge about coffee! One of the best memory from Bali.",Lovely architecture and the love they put in each coffee types that they created. Wasn't hard to find the location since they put these signs on the road or just simply follow the map. Tranquility at it's best. Amazing experience just to enjoy the nature and spoil yourself into some coffee tasting experience if you are a true coffee lover.,"I really love the atmosphere of this place. It is quiet and serene. I can actually sit here for hours!
My husbans and I ordered Hot Latte and Americano, and they taste so good! And you can also buy coffee packs to take home with you.",Never Comes here - I ask for 3 times but no positive revert from the staff or manager about the change of room - it was lizards 🦎 in the room - both the nights - they don’t bother at all to take an action or change the room - too rude staff - I also finds big cockroaches 🪳 in the room - same response and also a lot of masquitos as well - no positive response from the team at all - they are not at all interested to revert - very unprofessional. Think many a times before coming here 🙏🙏🙏
