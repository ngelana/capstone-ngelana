We arrived to Bali from Maldives, and instantly wish we could have stayed at Umana Bali for the entire 3 weeks of our trip. First, the villas are like no villa I have stayed in. I have been to the Maldives 3 times and I have stayed at some other nice, all-villa resorts. But the villas at Umana Bali tops them all. The size, layout, and amenities of the villas made us not want to leave. I particularly loved the large pool. It was large enough to swim laps! And if you just wanted to lay out in the sun, there was plenty of space on the patio for that too. Inside the villa, there was plenty of space for everyone to spread out. It was just the two of us, but we could see us enjoying the villa with a kid too. The Breakfast at Commune was amazing. I recommend coming on a very empty stomach because there are so many options to choose from. We seriously have told everyone about this place and place to visit again in the near future. Thanks Umana Bali for a great honeymoon.","This hotel was so lovely that we didn't want to leave. We stayed for two nights and felt very comfortable. The facilities were well-maintained, and the staff were all very nice. They greeted us warmly as soon as we got out of the car. The hotel is very beautiful, and Aditya showed us around and provided us with a lot of help during our stay. We are very grateful to have met him on our trip and would like to thank him again. The rooms are spacious and the design details are very tasteful. My husband and I both think this hotel is amazing and would recommend it to our friends. The dinner and breakfast at the restaurant were delicious. We will definitely stay here again next time.","This hotel is definitely 5 stars! Amazing atmosphere and excellent staff. The view is magnificent. I wish we could've stayed longer but due to unforeseen personal circumstances we were only able to spend only one night. However, the Umana staff made myself and my wife feel welcomed. We can't wait to comeback at the earliest opportunity.","This is heaven. It's the best accommodation that makes your trip to Bali even better. The room is renovated so it's cleaner and cooler, and the pool is big and spacious. There is also a jacuzzi, so you can swim at night.
The food I had for room service was the best, and the cocktails were delicious, so I drink them every day. The breakfast was so delicious that I was touched while eating all the food. I'm really happy.
The kids like the kids club, so we played for three hours today. All the employees are always smiling and making the customers happy.
The best thing I've ever done on this trip is that I can stay in this wonderful place for five days.
I'm a little sad about the view from the room because it's the partial ocean view, but I'm still very happy about my birthday in a wonderful place. Next time, I will stay in the panoramic view room.","We had the pleasure of staying here during our visit to Bali and while it's a bit off the beaten path, it was totally worth the visit. The entire resort is beautifully landscaped and surrounded by captivating views. Our curator Wira was very attentive and our villa was spotless and even more stunning in person, but we really wished they offered a complimentary upgrade for being a Hilton diamond member.

The continental breakfast at The Commune (which was included with our Hilton Honors status) was amazing. It's a mix of buffet style with the option to order off their a la carte menu. There is a wide selection ranging from traditional Indonesian cuisine to western dishes.

My only gripe was the beach was a huge disappointment. For the price that they charge, I wish they had a private beach. The driver took us down Melasti Beach and I'm not sure if it was an off day, but there was so much trash and litter among the shore. We were there around 8am and when we sat down on one of the beach chairs, a lady came over and told us we had to pay to use one. Pretty ridiculous that there aren't reserved chairs for paying guests at the resort."

From the moment we lifted off, the exhilaration was palpable. The helicopter provided a smooth and surprisingly comfortable ride, with panoramic windows offering breathtaking views of the landscape below.

Our pilot was not only highly skilled but also a fantastic guide, pointing out landmarks and sharing interesting facts throughout the journey.

In summary, the helicopter flight was an extraordinary experience that I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a thrilling and visually stunning adventure. It was a perfect blend of excitement, education, and natural beauty that left me with lasting memories and a deeper appreciation for the wonders of our world.","Had an absolutely amazing experience today at Fly Bali. Tyas and Intan kindly greeted us on arrival and went through a thorough safety briefing that helped calm any nerves before departure. Neither of us had been on a helicopter before so this really helped give us confidence in the professional processes that Fly Bali put in place to give a safe and enjoyable experience. We did the Taste of Bali flight, which is a short 12 minute flight but it most certainly packs a punch! It was a beautiful and thrilling flight that left us buzzing for hours afterwards. A lovely personal touch from the staff at Fly Bali was they greeted us on our return with a happy birthday banner for my partner who‚Äôs birthday it was, this was very unexpected and was a nice surprise! Looking forward to flying again with fly Bali next time we visit! Thanks a million","My first unbelievable helicopter ride experience ü•πüöÅ‚ô•Ô∏è We headed to this place I'd heard so much about ‚Äî super professional and offering a really nice helicopter experience, and it turned out to be amazing.

The staff were incredibly kind and made sure we boarded on time. The trip itself, with views of the ocean and Uluwatu, was truly cool.

No doubt about it, this is the spot for a helicopter ride! Thank me later. ‚ò∫Ô∏è","I recently had the pleasure of taking a 30-minute helicopter ride with Fly Bali Heliport, and it was an incredible experience from start to finish. The staff was exceptionally polite and accommodating, making the entire process smooth and enjoyable. Our pilot was outstanding, ensuring a safe and thrilling flight while showcasing the breathtaking scenery.

I would like to give a special mention to Tyas, who provided exceptional service throughout our experience. Tyas was incredibly attentive and helpful, making sure we were comfortable and well-informed at every step.

Moreover, I forgot some personal items at the helipad and only realized it after returning to my hotel. Despite it being past their working hours, Tyas went out of their way to deliver my belongings to me. This level of customer service is truly remarkable.

I highly recommend Fly Bali Heliport for anyone looking for an unforgettable helicopter experience. Their commitment to customer satisfaction is truly impressive.","Had such an amazing time with Fly Bali! Felt super safe and secure, the process was very clear and you can see such beautiful views of Bali and the ocean. Thank you especially to Okahara and the team for the wonderful hospitality üôè‚ù§Ô∏è"

1) quality of the room are different in some of them not good hot water (!) and wife
2) a good breakfast
3) swimming pool with awesome view
4) 3 minutes drive from one of my favorite beaches Melasty.

- Not recommend for staying who don‚Äôt drive bike. Quite far from everything. (!)
Acceptable for a short time enjoying the nature and beach.","Beautiful villa 3 min from Melasti Beach, one of the most beautiful beaches in the area.
The villa is romantic, with a bamb√∫ shower and a bath inside. Very comfy. Infinity swimming pool. Even some friendly monkeys domesticated from the neighbours come to visit u in the morning. Lovely place to stay!","Very comfortable and quiet villa Very, helpful staff
The price is very affordable. I will stay at this villa again if I go to Bali because it is close to Melasti Beach","Location is the best thing for me, very secluded, soothed by nature and yet it is not too far to reach the crowds in the surrounding areas."

I have been to Bali at least a dozen times staying in different villas. This was the best place I've stayed. The area is very quiet and relaxing, with a beautiful view of the ocean from the main pool and restaurant. Melasti beach is very near, and one of the best in South Kuta. The villas are well designed and well looked after - better than what you usually see in Bali. Depending on your perspective a positive or negative, there are lots of monkeys in the villa area. We enjoyed it, because they are not as aggressive as other monkeys in Bali and for instance, never bothered us in the restaurant. Very clean pools,  outdoor showers and great open grassy areas for kids to walk around. We really enjoyed it.","a comfortable place, suitable for those who like a quiet place. privacy is well maintained because the villas are separated from one another. the room is clean and the mattress is still new","The rooms are gorgeous, with alot of potential. There were slight issues with our stay such as: the TV not working for half of out stay, the water from taps splattered, and not all of the lights worked. However, the staff were helpful. Complementary breakfast is filling.","A long way to become a 5 star hotel; the villas are very nice, however the service is zero as you need to find somebody to order food or a drink. Not a honeymoon place as you can feel quite abundant-nobody is around((((.
Hopefully, as the place just opened, they will improve.","One of the best views seen so far and amazing hospitality. The cook and servers at the restaurant are brilliant and very warm.
