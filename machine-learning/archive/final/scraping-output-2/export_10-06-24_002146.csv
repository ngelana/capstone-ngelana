A very comfortable bungalow (no AC though) in the corner of the Farm separated and private with a nice porch and the Jungle right outside where you can see the bananas ripen on the tree, the hen walking about with her chickens, hearing the crickets play and see the most beautiful butterflies. You walk up quite a number of stairs = daily exercise to the Farm where several generations of Ketuts family live, there we enjoy Mades healthy and good breakfast and meals overlooking the beautiful garden with lots of Flowers. We also loved the fresh fruit and smoothies to every meal. A few minutes walk to the left we came to the Patty Fields with the vulcanos in a Distance, a breathtaking view, where we could see the people working in their Fields. If we instead turn right we came into Cepaka Village, because of the weather all shores were done outside so we could see the daily life of the balinese people. Ketut is also an exceptionel guide with lots of knowledge and he showed us lots of differen special places. We stayed 4 nights at his other Homestay, Tegel Sari, on the other side of the Island, where he arranged an unforgettable snorkeling tour and us being part of rescuing a baby Turtle.",,,,
