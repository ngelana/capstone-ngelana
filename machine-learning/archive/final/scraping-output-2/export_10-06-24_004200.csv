ChIJ79oiX9oX0i0RLtG8sYRZpXo,Bandung Waterfall,-8.519375199999999,115.30794920000001,"Siangan, Gianyar, Gianyar Regency, Bali 80515, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=8837568270236963118,OPERATIONAL,+62 811-394-684,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.2,443,,It is a nice place and it is not crowded by tourist yet. I was there at 10.00 and I was the only one. You have to pay 20.000 IDR to get in. One thing to know is that the best view of the waterfall is only to see once you actually enter the water and swim through those rocks. It‚Äôs a really short swim. After you can rinse yourself off with some cleaner water.,"This review reflects my experience, of course. Using Google Maps, I easily found the waterfall.

Entrance:

The entrance is clearly marked upon arrival. There's an entrance fee of IDR 20,000 ‚Äì be sure to get a ticket!**  Unfortunately, I arrived early and was scammed by someone who took my money without giving a ticket. I had to pay again when the legitimate staff arrived.

The Waterfall:

The waterfalls themselves are beautiful and worth the entrance fee. There are opportunities for swimming, but caution is advised due to slippery rocks.

Local Help:

A friendly local helps visitors navigate the area, takes pictures, and keeps the place clean. Consider tipping them to support the local economy.",I will give 5 stars but we were not lucky with the water. We came there at 4:30 pm and it was a really very rainy day. So the water was very dirty. No one was at the entrance. And of course we didn‚Äôt pay. But it was amazing. We didn‚Äôt swim but it was great. You can definitely see on my video how beautiful it was.,"The entrance fee is 20,000. I think it's a little bit pricy compared to other waterfalls. The water is not as clean as we expected, there is a sewage in the water what is coming from washing machines because there is a foam in the water and there is turbid water. You allowed to swim there but I wouldn't swim in this water.","Amazing waterfall!

If you feel brave you can also jump and the staff will guide you. But please be careful, water is only 3m deep. My boyfriend jumped in the water (he is 1.95m) and reached the ground with his feet (not injured). So only jump if you know how to do it and follow staff‚Äôs instructions!

Overall, it is easily accessible (good staircase) and there is a small shower and ‚Äúpools‚Äù for people who don't wanna jump

Great view üíï"

No waterfall, no people. Just nothing. One beautiful location and nothing more. But when you are at Bali you can find so many beautiful places. Don‚Äôt lose your time for this one. We came just because it was very close to our location. Not recommended","Stunningly beautiful site. Quite a good hike to get there, but totally worth it. You‚Äôll probably be here all alone, no tourists - which makes it even better.",,,
