Mengwi, Kabupaten Badung, Bali 80351, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=8159195785471181208,OPERATIONAL,+62 877-6163-8533,,"hotel, fitness_center, gym, guest_house, sports_complex, lodging, health",4.8,167,,"A really special place on Bali! Amazingly friendly staff and very nice yoga classes for all levels. This is a great destination wether you just want to do some yoga or are on a spiritual journey, you can just relax and take a breather from live. They also offer interesting events to get insights into balinese culture. I absolutely loved my stay here.
There is some room for improvement: the pool area is really nice but lacks furniture for relaxing, as does the rest of the accommodation except for your own room and chairs in the restaurant. I didn't really know where to go when I had some free time and just wanted to chill. The food is also really good but gets a little repetitive after a few days, especially the breakfast.","I had the most amazing, special week at Shanti Toya ‚ù§Ô∏è
I was pretty nervous about going on my own and as someone very new to yoga but I had no need to worry! The yoga was so good and taught by local teachers which made it feel very authentic. They taught to all abilities (beginner - advanced) and I felt really comfortable in all of the classes. I learnt and improved so much within the week.
All of the staff were so so lovely and they learnt everyone‚Äôs names too! The food was amazing and all of the daily activities were really fun (also obviously optional so you can choose which you‚Äôd like to do). The rooms were basic but had everything you needed and the grounds were stunning - such a lovely fresh water pool.
I honestly can‚Äôt recommend this retreat enough - an extremely authentic Balinese yoga experience with amazing attentive staff and an amazing group of people ü´∂üèª","Shanty Toya is a hidden gem in the world of yoga retreats. It offers an unparalleled experience that goes beyond expectations, providing everything and more that one could desire. This tranquil haven embodies genuine kindness, generosity, and love, evident in every aspect of the retreat.

From the heartfelt meals lovingly prepared and served to the exemplary dedication of the staff. Kalina thank you for my room, immensely appreciated, thank you for sharing your knowledge and story, the yoga teachers, masseurs, and every member of the Shanty Toya team, the essence of Balinese hospitality shines through. Their unwavering commitment to providing assistance and accommodating every guest exemplifies the spirit of service ingrained in Balinese culture.

The expansive yoga shala is equipped with everything necessary for a fulfilling practice. It serves as a sanctuary where guests can immerse themselves fully in their yoga journey.

Shanty Toya is more than just a retreat; it's an embodiment of the love and warmth that the Balinese people embrace. It's a place where guests can rejuvenate their mind, body, and spirit.

Experience the magic of Shanty Toya and elevate your yoga journey to new heights.","I had an amazing time at Shanti Toya. The yoga instructors are all locals which I found super helpful to really indulge in learning from their knowledge, but also to get to know many different types of yoga that I didn't know before as a beginner.

The camp itself itself is a very peaceful environment that invites to relax and focus on the program offered. The latter is also fantastic due to activities asides of yoga alone (balinese culture experience tour,  cooking and dancing class, etc) Plus I made amazing friendships at Shanti Toya, that regardless of my particular cohort, surely await all people that flock to this great yoga retreat. Highly recommendable.","Shanti Toya was incredible! Staff were always so welcoming and friendly and food was amazing. I enjoyed the pool and daily yoga classes as well as the cultural tours and foods, I made some of my best friends from this retreat. Highly, highly recommend to anyone, thankyou so much! Definitely visiting again"
