Nice atmosphere and view, great spot for family gatherings or simply some quiet time.",I visited Adipusps in the winter vacation of 2020. This is really a great place for either friends or family to have a cozy time together. People here are so kind. Kuni the dog is also welcomedüê∂  It‚Äôs also a good place for city people to chill down. I would like to spend the whole afternoon only sitting here to meditate or to just read a book if I have another chance traveling to Bali in the future. It‚Äôs better visiting here yourself than just see my review here on googleüëª,"In the winter vacation, I visited Kelecung.
The villagers in this village are very warm and generous.You will feel relaxed because of the natural flavor here. The beauty here is still in my mind after returning home.

From the moment I stepped through the door, the vibrant ambiance enveloped me like a warm hug. The walls adorned with quirky artwork and the staff sporting hilariously punny aprons set the stage for a dining experience that was anything but ordinary.

Now, let's talk about the food, shall we? Oh, dear reader, prepare your taste buds for a wild adventure! With each juicy bite, I found myself contemplating the meaning of life.",Very tasty and good quality food üëç,"Great choice and ambience!

The owners are nice and warm people. Food is prepared fast and tastes very good. Not happy with the choice of the meny? No worries, they will prepare the meal you want.
I like Wayan's enterprenerual spirit. Always looking for a feedback and trying to improve his place.
I wanted to order food for my whole family and was offered home delivery as well. Service 10/10!!","If your in tabanan, please go to Wayan, he's wife makes best chicken soup and nasi goreng in Tabanan, please visit them. Its today 20 march 2019. And we like it very much."

It is part of a hydroponic farm and serves a selection of coffee (espresso, late, mocha, etc) as well as herbal and green teas. They're currently renovating the hydroponic farm, so we're not serving food today. The owner, Aniek, would be the friendliest cafe owner we met while on our month long trip in Bali. We had a lovely chat about a documentary that has been made about her father and family (and she produced!) called 'Segara Gunung'. I can't wait to see it. There is even an upstairs bale that has views of the water temple and has free wifi. A must visit if you're in the area.",A comfortable place to work while enjoying a cup of coffee in a quiet rural area.

I feel rehabbed!) and anything I might need (cables, proper chair and table for my remote working). The place is super clean, Wifi is good enough to handle video calls and file sharing. The secret fruit garden with all its gems is a must seen and tried! Thanks guys, I wish I could be back soon!","We stayed in Ratih Homestay for a month end enjoyed every single day. Located in Kelecung Village, it's an excellent place to soak in and enjoy nature, surrounded by paddy fields as far as the eyes can see and only a short motorcycle ride away from a beautiful and clean black sand beach. For those who want a getaway holiday from the hustle and bustle of the city, this is the right place to be.

They had two types of accomodation, one an air-conditioned room and the other a traditional Bali ""bale"" style open structure. Both were good, but for a short term stay, I'd recommend choosing the latter to experience spending the night in a half-open air structure. You won't feel too hot even without air conditioning because it gets pleasantly cool once the sun sets, and you can even hear the ocean waves lulling you to sleep along with the night breeze.

The host family is very nice and accomodating, providing us delicious homecooked meals every single day at a very affordable price, giving us various treats from around the area and fresh fruits grown in their own field, lending us their motorcycle so that we could scour the village‚Äîdoing all they can to make our stay as pleasant as it could be. Thank  you so much to Pak Made, Bu Dian, and Nenek for the past month, we truly enjoyed our stay and hope we can visit again one day üòä‚ô•Ô∏è",,,
