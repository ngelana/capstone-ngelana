Off the beaten path… total relaxation is possible! The Sea Villa was private and has refined spaces.
The massages were sublime and listening to the crashing ocean waves in the outdoor pavilion added to the relaxation.
Every staff member was helpful, respectful and professional. The food was superb and being gluten free was catered for with some delicious desserts!
We loved our stay in this incredible Bali oasis.","Staying at Shunyata Villas Bali was an amazing experience. We loved everything about our stay. The massages were fantastic, and the staff were even better – incredibly friendly and attentive. The setting is beautiful and peaceful, making it the perfect place to relax and unwind. Highly recommended!",A beautiful villa nestled between the blue sea and the green mountains with a view that is soothing for one's eyes and soul. If you choose Shunyata Villas for your vacation I would strongly recommend to try their Hot Lava Stone massage. It will definitely reduce your stress and make you feel like you have a new body again. We also had a romantic candle light dinner here with the beautiful view of the setting sun. To sum it all we came here exhausted and left totally rejuvenated. Cheers to all associated with Shunyata!!,"Nestled on a serene cliff in Bali, Shunyata Luxury Eco Villas, aptly nicknamed the Secret on the Cliff, offers an unparalleled retreat experience that effortlessly marries luxury with tranquility. Accessible via a convenient taxi ride from Denpasar, which can be seamlessly arranged by the resort, Shunyata stands as a beacon of personalized and discreet hospitality with its exclusive collection of just five villas—soon to be six, with the imminent opening of a new addition.

Our stay in the Sea Villa was nothing short of spectacular. The villa exudes an air of opulence and comfort, featuring a spacious bedroom equipped with air conditioning, ensuring a restful night's sleep amidst the tropical climate. The outdoor amenities are a highlight: a large private infinity pool with breathtaking ocean views, a charming sitting area perfect for alfresco dining, a double sunbed for basking in the sun, and an outdoor shower adjacent to the pool, adding a touch of nature to the luxurious setting. The villa also boasts a well-equipped kitchen area with modern amenities, a delightful selection of fresh fruit, and a convenient pay-as-you-go minibar.

The culinary experience at Shunyata is a gastronomic delight. The food is incredibly fresh, bursting with flavor, and meticulously prepared to cater to a variety of tastes and preferences. Every meal felt like a celebration of local ingredients, elevated by exquisite presentation and thoughtful service.

One of the most remarkable aspects of our stay was the personable and friendly staff. The new young management team took exceptional care of us, always making sure to check in whenever we crossed paths. Their warm hospitality and genuine interest in our comfort truly enhanced our experience, making us feel like more than just guests.

The resort's attention to detail extends to the villa's interior lighting, which is artfully designed to enhance the beauty of every corner. From the soothing glow that highlights the architectural elegance to the ambient lights that create a cozy atmosphere, every element is carefully curated to offer a visually stunning experience.

For those seeking relaxation and rejuvenation, the on-site massage hideaway is a sanctuary. The array of treatments available ensures that guests can find the perfect therapy to unwind and indulge, all bookable for the next day, adding to the seamless and relaxing experience.

Additionally, the resort features a magnificent shared infinity pool that offers uninterrupted views of the ocean, creating a perfect backdrop for a leisurely swim or a peaceful moment of reflection.

Our time at Shunyata Luxury Eco Villas was so enchanting that we can't stop raving about it. The combination of luxurious accommodations, exceptional service, and the stunning natural surroundings make it a destination we are eager to return to. We've already begun spreading the word and plan to bring friends and family along to share in the unparalleled beauty and serenity of this hidden gem on the cliffs of Bali. Shunyata is not just a place to stay; it's an experience that leaves an indelible mark on your soul.","It's difficult to find, but once you've found it, you won't want to leave. The place is magical. It's not villa next to villa, but it's a big place with a lot of well-kept nature. The Shunyata team attaches great importance to privacy and relaxation. We had an incredible sunset almost every day."
