Will be here again in another chance.

Hot air outside room, cold inside room. Cold air outside room, warm inside room.","I am conflicted on this one. The host is nice, the view is stunning, everything is decently clean when it comes to the price point.
Like everywhere in the area, it is swarming with flies. The garden of the accommodation has no garbage in it, so I like to believe it is a bit better here than some other places.
But, and this is a big but, the hut has no soundproofing at all and is build right up against a street. Bikes, trucks, it feels like they drive through you bed. Traffic goes down between 22-5, but even then I was never able to get more than one hour of continuous sleep and I am by no means a light sleeper. Over that had to be one of the worst nights I ever had in a bed. It made waking up for sunrise really easy though...","This place have a very nice view, reasonable price and also very clean rooms. The owner also very friendly, they provide us bonfire and arrange our Jeep Tour. Will visit this place  again with my family next trip. Thank you Semadi Mountain View","Stayed there couple of nights, very relaxing atmosphere, really good cleanliness and really peaceful. You open your door and mount Batur is in front of you. Lovely and super friendly staff.
Also with bonfire spot in the garden.
Just magic!","Stayed here last night. The room is spacious facing a gorgeous mountain view. The family who owns and runs it are very nice and helpful, she offered to cook us dinner.. Highly recommended!"
