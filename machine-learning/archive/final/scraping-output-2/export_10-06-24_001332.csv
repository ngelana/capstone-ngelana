Just try it if you want a great local experience :)","Let's do Clint Eastwood review style for this local warung.
Here's the good, bad and ugly stuff that I can report to give an idea if you should come here or not.
Good: Local delicacy made with local ingredients. Fresh as always and cook on demand. Always made it the way I ordered.

Bad: Smoke. If you're ordering anything that needs to be grilled, your order will come with a side of BBQ smoke. If you're lucky, the wind will carry it outside. If not learn to hold your breath. üòÜ Or just don't offer anything BBQ/grilled.

Ugly: Not much to report if your expectations are realistic (this is in front of a private home).",Delicious traditional food and Made and his family are very good hosts!! All of the dishes were very tasty. Thanks Made!,"A great last minute decision to eat here as there aren't many restaurants open late. The food was great (pork and chicken satay, and grilled fish) and the service was perfect. Feels like a family run place. Will definitely come back.","Warung nike is our local favourite - real indonesian food with fantastic flavour and great price. The restaurant is a pretty green oasis on the main road, full of plants and a beautiful family compound behind. The food is authentic and delicious, nothing like the bland food at tourist places where you pay four times the price. We have enjoyed their satay, fried chicken and fish, and super yummy and spicy kangkung and gado gado. The secret pink fried rice is a delight and super tasty! We‚Äôve been three times this week and will be back for more, our toddler even enjoyed it so much. They also do delivery that is convenient and easy, arriving fresh and hot. Terimakasi!"

From the moment we arrived, we felt incredibly welcomed and part of their family.

One of the highlights was being invited to the family temple ceremony. They provided us with sarongs to wear, shared meals with us and took the time to explain their culture and traditions. It was such a unique and memorable experience that we'll cherish forever.

They offer food service which is super convenient. Kadek also helped us arrange a driver, which made exploring the area so easy. They also rent scooters if you prefer.

Kadek and his family are truly wonderful people. We feel so lucky to have met them and stayed in their home. It was the best local experience we could have hoped for. We loved every moment and would recommend staying here 100 times over.  If you're looking for an authentic stay in Bali, this is the place to be!

Hope to see you again soon friends!","Wow! Our stay at this Airbnb was absolutely fantastic from start to finish. The unit itself is nestled within a serene temple complex, providing a truly unique and enchanting atmosphere. Our host was incredibly lovely and welcoming, making us feel right at home from the moment we arrived.

One of the highlights of our stay was getting to know the amazing Balinese family members who reside within the compound. Their warmth and hospitality gave us an authentic and up-close experience of Balinese culture, which was truly unforgettable.

The space itself was incredibly comfortable, with all the amenities we needed for a relaxing stay. The air conditioning kept us cool even on the hottest days, and the fast internet allowed us to stay connected with ease.

One of the best perks was being able to rent a scooter directly from the host, making it convenient to explore the surrounding area at our own pace. Additionally, the host was more than happy to assist us with arranging taxis whenever we needed them.

Overall, our experience at this Airbnb was beyond amazing, and we can't wait to return. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an authentic and memorable stay in Bali!","Really enjoyed our 3 month stay here.
The whole family is super kind and helps you with everything. It is a very quiet and peacefull place, away from the city. The place is very clean. The breakfast was also amazing, best nasi goreng!","Highly Recommended. Experience the Bali culture, it feels like you have a new family in Bali. Located in a traditional Balinese compound surrounded by greenery out of the crowd. Stayed for three nights, Kadek Agus and his families are really helpful making sure that you are okey with what you need. The room is very comfortable to relax and everything works perfectly.
Thank you to the great host ever, Definitely will coming back on our next visit.","Warm welcome from the family, real Balinese experience stay. We stayed at ‚Äòsikut satak‚Äô they called it, just next to the family temple (every Balinese Hindu they have a family temple where they pray and put the offerings everyday) kind of a unique experience I am so lucky I stayed there, the room is clean, the place is quiet it‚Äôs relaxing and not far from Ubud city center which is perfect ü§©ü§©ü§©"

The walk through the rice fields was amazing and our guide Made was very knowledgeable about the local area and how the farmers do their work. The jungle walk was equally spectacular. We got to try local coffee and drink from a freshly harvested coconut. Highly recommended!,Got lucky and did a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù tour with Made who was very hospitable and open in sharing his life in the countryside. The rice fields were beautiful and I had a good time trekking in the jungle learning about the plants and his way of life. Great experience and highly recommend to anyone looking to experience like a local!,Made and his family were amazing hosts! If you want to see and experience real Balinese life you should reach out and take this tour. You‚Äôll see traditional rice fields and explore the jungle (including a coconut straight from the tree). Finishing with a delicious meal I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience! 10/10 recommend :),"We got to see Made's family compound and he gave us insight into the local Balinese lifestyle and it was very interesting. Then onto the village's rice fields and tropical jungle where we met farmers and tasted village grown coffee and freshly picked mangosteens and coconuts. The whole experience was truly magical and we're so glad we took this tour. Requires a lot of trekking in nature, but Made is very accommodating and will adjust to your fitness level. We'd love to take his tour again!",Amazing experience! Guide was amazing and friendly. Took the time to answer all my questions and to show me everything native to Bali! I would recommend this to anyone visiting Bali who wants to be exposed to Balinese culture without large crowds! Absolutely amazing!
