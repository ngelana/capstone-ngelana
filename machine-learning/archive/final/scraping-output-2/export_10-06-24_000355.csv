The water is nice and it‚Äôs quite expansive. We hiked a bit and found two main waterfalls, one mini waterfall, pig farm, and a cave. I recommend going early in the morning as we got here at 9:30 am and it got busy fast. For 20k rupiah, it was pretty awesome!","Beautiful waterfall which is fairly newly opened to tourists I believe. Clean toilets, small stand selling drinks, not too many steps down (and then up on the way back!) and a well trodden path which wasn't dangerous at all in my opinion.
The water, as expected, was very cold! But some lovely photos!","It‚Äôs not the biggest waterfall around this area and  also not the busiest

If you want to swim, you have to go through some rocks to get in the water, for me, it didn‚Äôt feel very inviting so I decided against swimming ü§î

Entrance cost around 20K","Another beautiful waterfall in Bali. Not difficult to reach, from the parking lot it only takes about 5 minutes to get down. There is koi pond, and if you hike a little bit you can see another waterfall. The bridge need to repair for safety reason. Ticket price only 20k/person. Better go on weekday, cause on weekend it can be so crowded","The waterfall is beautiful. there is less crowd. The water still has blue color and there are some koi fish swim around. THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE ACCESS TO THE WATERFALL. It‚Äôs so easy and not far away from the ticket counter. For local, the ticket price is 20k Rupiah and for tourists is 30k Rupiah. You can also get free coffee after your visit to the waterfall. The coffee counter is in front of the ticket counter. There is no chair or place to put your belongings while swimming, though. However, there‚Äôs some rock to put your belongings. In google map, it said to be open until 5 pm, but I came at a quarter to 5 pm and they still let me in. They said, they open until 6 pm for visitors that came before 5 pm.

If you go straight from the waterfall, there‚Äôs a jungle track. I don‚Äôt know what you can find in the end of the track, because, when I was there, it was raining. I suggested you to not explore the track while rain because it‚Äôs quite slippery and dangerous (you can fall to the river). STAY SAFE!"

Staff are friendly and attentive.

Food wise is mixed feelings, some are good some are mediocre. The one that I have was rather ""lack in flavour"", my friend said his was good.","One of the best restaurants in Bali that we‚Äôve ever tried. The food is fabulous, the staff is accommodating, and the ambiance is so refreshing. We‚Äôll definitely come back. Keep up the good work. ‚ù§Ô∏è","Very good customer service , cool vibe .
The food was surprisingly tasty and good.  I had crispy chicken any my husband fish with balenese sauce , a young coconut and a mixed juice.
Keep up with the good work and service !"

The view from the restaurant towards the rice field was beautiful!,Great place to chill and have authentic Balinese cuisine!,"Very close to the temple and much more reasonably priced then some of the other places we saw prior to attending. You can eat with a view over the local rice paddy, you are right next to a busy road mind. The juice was proper fresh, but of fruit and no added sugar proves that fact."

Which are awesome waterfall, river, forest, etc.  So if you have any plan to camp, you have to consider this place on your list","Awesome!!! If you need to take yourself for a weekend camp, this is one of the best place to go. With the signature of Balinese hospitality and fresh air from the woods will fill you with positive energy. They also offered some outdoor activities like : trekking, tubing, and sometimes slack line. The trek itself is a route that follows the Petanu river, against the stream, that ended at the hidden waterfall. The way back to the camp ground is a caving trip, where you need flashlight to enter. Well, after all, it's worth the visit!!!","Was really interesting place for stay and enjoy the view, there is a stunning waterfall.

Nice trekking path
Interesting cave
Enjoyable activities
Nice camp

Thank you for all Paras Petanu team for their hospitality....","I've been going to Paras Petanu and I'd highly recommend it to anyone, especially families. The site is beautiful and the people are warm and welcoming.",Enjoy the time with best camp ground with a waterfall view.

However, was let down by the miserable serving of only 1 piece of the skin (see photos) Is this the usual standard?

We did not eat the ""intestines or organs"" served with the rice and other veggies... ! The bowl of soup or rather thick gravy tasted good tho (is it bamboo shoot or banana stems?)

What is the correct price ? Local 20K and Tourists 40K for the same food but Dual Pricing.. ??","Authentic Babi Guling, fresh and flavorful. The soup with baby banana pieces was very delicious and had a kick. My favorite was the crispy pork pieces. Veggies were refreshing and cooked well. It's definitely worth a try if you are in the area. It's also outdoorsy.

Use your hands to eat :)","As authentic as we could find
Great food, cutlery containing few stains of previous servings. Food vs price  excellent.

Very friendly staff and great view","So we got to this place due to the previous review. And no disappointment at all.
It's a simple side of the road warung, all in good conditions. And an amazing view to the jungle on the side.
And the babi guling oh my God, super tasty. We have had one before and this one was mind blowing. The little soup it's super tasty and all vegetables and pork amazing taste.
We got the same price 40k idr for the little bowl of soup, plate with pork, rice and veggies and drink.","Found this shop with a little detour on our way to Gunung Batur. Taste delicious, soft and tender but the highlight is the deep fried pork"
