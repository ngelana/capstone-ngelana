While it is away from all of the activity in Bali, the seclusion of this resort provides the peace one seeks. The staff were incredibly friendly and beyond attentive. The scuba diving team were also supportive and I recommend this place for anyone who's looking for a private bungalow/resort and unlimited dives.","Amazing dive resort! Great staff, friendly and hospitality is top notch.

The dive shop manager is excellent and coordination with the guides.

The dive sites are close by and top notch.

Services and spa were amazing.

Had a great week long stay here with a dive group. Would definitely return (again and again)!","Had a wonderful holiday at Alam Batu. The stay is beautiful with great hosts, food and outlook. We went for diving and were not disappointed. Susan and her team of DMs were amazing. I did two courses with Susan and was very grateful for her calm and professional nature. The DMs were great at guiding and very helpful with getting to and from the boat and organising our dive gear for the two- three dives a day.
I can definitely see us returning to this place, wonderful holiday.",Came by here by chance on a motorbike tour across the island. The hotel staff were kind enough to take me in without a reservation (which I do not recommend you to do). The food is simple but very well made and the beach bungalows are very high end.,"Great staff, amazing location, authentic food and experienced dive guides. I can fully recommend Alam Batu! Danke Danny für einen tollen Aufenthalt!"

Having your own private bungalow with a pool, privacy, lovely food and great service was fantastic!!
The whole complex is in the process of all being upgraded and looking beautiful!
Easy to access great scuba diving spots and most accommodating Staff driving you into the quaint township.
Staff Brilliant !!

Location a 3 only due to the community is still recovering from Covid impact. ….","We were there when weather was too hot and rooms ACs weren't big enough to cool down
Apart from that a fab place
Staff and food were super amazing
Very nice and quite location and great snorkeling",The water from the shower smelt of rotten eggs. The floor of the shower on the other suite next to me has green algae on it hence why I didn't stay in that room. There is no TV reception so you can't watch the TV. Most of the roofs on the surrounding accommodation buildings have rotting leaves on them which you look onto. There is a lot of water dripping off the roofs at random places and there is a lot of signs of mould and water damage inside of the buildings. You cannot rent snorkels so you need to go into town to get them. There is a lot of rubbish on the black pebble beach at the property. The metal gate to the pebble beach is rusty and has a lot of paint peeling from it. The fountains in the water pond don't work and so the water is stagnant and has algae growing in it. The staff are very friendly and helpful.,"+best food we ate in 2 weeks in Bali!!
+food came quick, breakfast could be ordered the evening before, everything tasted sensational
+we were greeted with a welcome drink
+very clean big room and outdoor bathroom, AC, minibar, quiet place, you can hear the seaside at all times
+semi-private pool in front of the room, also big pool on the premises, next to the beach
+staff spoke good English and was really helpful booking massage and scuba-diving; a minivan is also available, they take you to the village or reservations you have

-the only negative thing is that the cocktails contained to much alcohol :)
-far from any restaurants, but you don't need to go out with what delicious food and good prices they have","This hotel is set quietly right on the coast and yet also close to the amenities in the wider area of Kubu. While here, the property was very quiet, meaning the shared pool by the sea was essentially a private one. The staff are always on hand to help in any way they can, are always friendly and prepare the most delicious and picture worthy included breakfast around."
