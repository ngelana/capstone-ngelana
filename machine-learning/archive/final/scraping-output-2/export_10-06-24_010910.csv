300 000/day is too expensive comparing than the facilities.....nothing help for your enjoyable staying.you are just by yourself...no guest services at all.

but i will give five stars for friendliness and courtesy of the staffs..i dont blame them...they are just workers without management.and be aware of electrical payment at the end....600 000 in 5 days.meter running even you are not using electric.disasterrrrrr....shocking....find hotel I do suggest.dissapoint big time.really hard to spend money for the place like this.....mafia","Recomended guest house for backpacker/family.
It located in Denpasar, also in Islamic society (Kp. Kepaon). Many food store in this area. Near fr9m Kuta beach, Mall, and other places.
It has 2 floor & 3 floor building.
For 3rd floor, each rooms have hot water bathroom.
The other rooms have same facility, AC, TV, big cupboard, dressing table, kitchen area (not include stove), bathroom with shower.
The water is bad, smell like have some iron.
The bathroom little bit dirty, sometime have cockroaches in kithcen.
The price IDR150K/night, you can get lower price from online booking.
It also can rent monthly for IDR1.5million/month (not include electricity).
Small parking for car, but enough for motorcycle.
(You may need rent motorcycle to explore Bali).",Reasonable price for homestay. Each room have kitchen! I love it. Nice parking lot and friendly staff,"Good and cheap guest house, and of course friendly staff","Not comfortable. But, what do you expect from the price they offered?"

Unfortunately, the reality exceeded our expectations in the worst possible way. Everything in the photos published by the hotel is real, but definitely dirtier. Torn and dirty towels, torn bed sheets, mold walls, walking geckos and cockroaches made our stay in this place unpleasant. The lovely bathroom outside is very neglected, with scale and moss everywhere, which, compared to other facilities in Bali, is possible to keep clean. Based on previous comments about the possibility of renting a scooter on site, we ordered it from the hotel staff - we were very disappointed. The scooter arrived with an absolutely empty tank, with damaged helmets without fasteners and they tried to convince us with a smile that such rental rules apply on the island (we used another rental company and nothing like that happened). After contacting the hotel in advance, we obtained information about possibility to transfer from the airport. After arranging all the details, contact with the hotel was lost and after landing we had to quickly look for another transport at the airport. Any comments reported to the hotel's staff remained unanswered only with an apology.
This place is dramatically neglected and the stay there was an unpleasant disappointment.",Nice place to stay while you're in Bali with reasonable price...clean...with swimming pool inside...,"I have scored my rating on my experience here at Lembayung based on price and location.
Middle of Bali. Close to everything. TV, cooker for home cooking and Air con good üëç Loved it.
One last thing, the hotel has a shop with essentials and great prices too.",Perfect for the price and VERY kind staff!! Recommended. Moto taxi to center costs 50 cent or so,"nice place,

Its so good, so authentic and yummy, especially the Kare Ramen and the Oishi Ramen. The spring roll is also so tasty and fresh. The place is kinda small, but cozy.","From the moment we entered, we were greeted by enthusiastic staff members. We then chose our menu, and our choice eventually fell on the Spicy Chicken Ramen because we love spicy food, hehe. You don't need to add anything because the spiciness and broth are just perfect for spicy food lovers. The price is very affordable, especially for students who may want to enjoy ramen with limited funds. The place is located next to the main road, but inside, it is soundproof. The service is also excellent, and I really like this place. Definitely will come back!","The broth is delicious, I'm not a fan of the noodle type but still ok, their topping is also very generous, usually ramen places will give only half eggs, but they give a whole egg + minced chicken and roast chicken is tasty. Overall recommended to come again","The food is decent for this price. If you find this one is less than perfect, it will continue to be busy because the toppings and portions are already pretty, according to the taste description. It's simple, almost like the Japanese series Indomie. But overall it's worth a try for beginners who want to try ramen, you can start trying it from this place, the price is cheap","I love this ramen, it's delicious, savory, the noodles are medium rare and not mushy, the place is not too big, the staff is friendly, the price is very affordable. I ordered the spicy ramen and the spiciness felt good.

Recommended.. üíØ"
