The inside felt really traditional, but cool. It's the perfect place to escape and relax. If you want a taste of Bali's beauty and culture, this bungalow is a must.","A true Balinese experience!
You will feel welcomed like you are part of the family. The meals are absolutely delicious. When you want you can share the meal with the family and they will explain about the Balinese life and culture. We were there with a one and half old baby who loved to play with all the children   Of the family.
They also organised for us trekking in the jungle with a traditional boat ride on the nearby lake.
I would recommend and I will definitely come back !!!","A special place. A beautiful multi-generational family. Warm, kind and educational. Easy walk to the Tamblingan Jungle Trek and Canoe starting point; and I recommend the walk to Munduk village. Steep descent so get a scooter back. My third stay in two years.","My favorite stay in Bali so far. Amazing hosts,  nice and cozy room, awesome view! Would come back 100% and highly recommend!","We got invited for dinner from Komand and his family. The food was delicious and we shared it together with other guests while dogs, chicken and cats were around. Komand gave us some wisdom about Balinese culture and hinduistic ceremonies lived by Balinese families in daily lifes.
Thank you so much !"

We have good strong coffee, the best pancakes in Bali and he showed us coffee trees and coffee making process. Very beautiful place with great view ‚ò∫Ô∏è","We found this coffee plantation due to the numerous positive reviews on Google Maps and the relatively close location to our villa (Munduk Heaven, ~25 minutes walk).  Komang (the owner) greeted us and showed us around his farm.  He grows so many interesting things like Arabica/Robusta coffee beans, cassava plants, bananas, green pancake (pendan) plant. He was very welcoming, walking us through the hill of his farm.  He wants to eventually make a small warung experience for guests visiting the farm and sell the coffee/honey.  We tried the coffee and Balinese pancake there and loved the coffee so much, we bought some coffee bean bags to take home (we wish we had bought honey bottles too but unfortunately ran out of cash).  We hope to come back again when we visit Bali!","Arriving at this jungle cafe was truly a delight. Hidden in the mountains between Bedugul and Singaraja it's definitely worth the drive. After parking the car we hiked up a narrow track to the location in the hill. Komang is the sweetest Balinese man and such a heart to share his work. Serving up coffee and tea from his own garden and despite the late hour that we arrived he showed us some berries in his garden which our children were delighted to eat fresh from the tree. Truly an educational experience for our young children to see the bees and taste fresh honey from the hive and home made coconut pancakes. Next time we visit we'll come earlier in the day so we can see all the plants he's growing and have a real tour. As it was, the fog and views over the village below was a delightful end to our day.
If you're ever in Munduk stop by this warung and support his business with buying some coffee and honey. You won't regret it!","We are always in search for hidden gems and this is one of them. Not the typical touristic coffee and honey farm. This is helmed by a one-man-show (a very nice humble and knowledgeable man) and everything is organically grown.

He made melted coconut sugar in pandan flavor crepes and his own roasted coffee too. Honey is straight from the comb.

We bought some coffee beans and cloves to support local farmers and businesses üëçüèª

Will definitely come back again even if it's a 3hrs ride for us. Spectacular view.","We went to Gedong Agro today.  The very loving owner explained his farm to us in detail, let us try different fruits and showed us his beehives.  The home-grown coffee with local palm sugar was also excellent.  The journey is easy, the view is beautiful and the visit is an enrichment to any holiday."
