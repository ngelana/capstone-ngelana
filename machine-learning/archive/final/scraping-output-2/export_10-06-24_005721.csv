A great relaxing holiday with our family. The online photos are great but the villa is even better in reality.
Close to everything by a short drive but also set apart so you can enjoy the peace and quiet of the local rice field surrounds. Great meals by the villa staff who also organised a great bike tour of the area. Beautiful infinity pool and tennis court.
Love this place!",We loved our holiday at Villa Dukuh.  The staff were very attentive and did everything to make our stay a wonderful balinese experience.  The food was amazing and the accommodation was beautiful.  The staff went out of their way for us and it was very sad to say good-bye.  Well worth a visit in a lovely village with beautiful staff from that village.,Very nice,ok for the price,
