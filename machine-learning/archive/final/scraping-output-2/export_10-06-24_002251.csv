Located in Bangli, it is far from the bustling Denpasar. Somehow the location has the perfect climate to enjoy the spicy dish.

I personally like the fried mujair very much, reminded me of childhood. I only add a little bit of nyat-nyat spices.

Everyone here is helpful, the place is basically an open traditional Balinese house. It has a very pretty fish pond too!",Stopped here on the way back from lake Batur. Good place to try out the mujair nyat nyat..a local delicacy which is fish dish with local spices.,my first time to try this so called mujair nyat-nyat. it was great. nice experience. the taste was great bruh. and the sambal matah made great combo with the fish. wanna comeback sometime.,"Traditional fish dish!! They accept request well and soup is one of unique dish here.
Don't miss Loloh cemcem, traditional herbal drink, taste like sweet and sour. It's diluted by soda is creative way to try!!","Went there to fed my curiousity about Mujair Nyat-Nyat, and it wasn't dissapointing.

It's located in the center of Bangli, 3 minutes from Kintamani-Gianyar main road, so it's easy to reach. They have parking space that fits for 5-7 cars, i think it's easy to get a parking spot.

I ordered a package of Mujair Nyat-Nyat, which contains a portion of rice, Plecing Kangkung, Jukut Undis, 2 types of Sambal, and Mujair Nyat Nyat. Everything was good, but i love Jukut Undis the most, it's like Rawon in East Java, but it contains beans and other mysterious ingredient that i hadn't ever tasted before.

Not too pricey, a nice-to-know dishes when you're in Bangli residence."
