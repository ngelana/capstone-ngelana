Even before the trip began, I experienced excellent service. They frequently checked in and greeted me through messages, and their response time was quick. Rizky and the planner were also very warm and personally greeted me, providing local information.

There were so many experiences to enjoy, such as swimming, massage services, cycling, and watching the sunrise. The breakfast and dinner options were abundant and suited our tastes perfectly. You could easily spend an entire day here! If you love nature, this place is a rural gem that is a must-visit when exploring Ubud. There are beautiful terraces near the bamboo area, and their conservation efforts are commendable. Moreover, the prices were very reasonable. I hope to visit again and explore more of the surrounding natural environment.

Overall, it was a fantastic experience.","If you get a chance to stay here take it!! Food is fantastic and the stay was amazing! It’s an adventure to get up here but we’ll worth it, the scenery on the way up is second to none! There is a Sulfur bath on the property that leaves you feeling great! And all services available on site.","I recently stayed at this hotel, and despite the beautiful pictures online, it turned out to be the worst place I've ever experienced. The food was terrible, the place was infested with insects, and we couldn't sleep well at all. There was no hot water for showering, and the road leading to the hotel was extremely difficult and rugged. Transportation was hard to come by, and they overcharged us for their private transport service. The place was eerie and creepy at night. When we tried to cancel some nights we had booked, they refused to refund our money. Overall, a truly disappointing and unpleasant stay.""

We spend more than 7,500,000 Rp
And leave after one night",Lovely place to have lunch.,"Amazing food, amazing atmosphere! Risky and the other guys were amazing and the food is delicious! Highly recommended!!!"
