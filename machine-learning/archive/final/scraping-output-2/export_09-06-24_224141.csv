I hope the local government can be firm about this issue and put an action for forest conservation. The deforestation will create a huge negative impact in the future and destroy the ecosystem including water issue. Please save the forest in West Bali!,Nice explore,,,

Me and my partner really enjoyed his company. He was very knowledgeable about the sites we visited and showed us a lot of birds. We saw about 60-70 species of birds in just a day of birding. Amazing! He brought us to a nice restaurant too for lunch. Food was really good and there were plenty of pescatarian and vegetarian options which was really nice. Overall, a very good experience in West Bali. I would highly recommend him as your bird guide in Bali. Thank you Made!","Made Surya guided me for four days on Bali. He has excellent birding skills, knows where to find difficult species and is good company. I recommend him as a bird guide and intend to visit east Java with him. I have attached three photos from my tour. Terry Reis - fauna ecologist & wildlife guide",Our 2 days of birding with Made were for me the highlight of our 3 week stay in Bali !  Made helped us to find very many different awesome birds and he can explain everything about them in fluent English.  Next time we're in Bali we'd want to spent even more time with this passionate guide !,"I had the pleasure of being guided by Made on a bird watching excursion, which turned out to be the highlight of my Bali trip. I only wish I had known about him sooner. Over the course of approximately 8 hours, we explored various habitats around Ubud, spotting around 30 different bird species. Made's extensive knowledge, informative insights, and genuine enthusiasm for the avian life in his country made the experience truly enjoyable. The package included travel to different areas, lunch, and water, making it a well-rounded and memorable day of birding. (08-01-2024)","Made did a fantastic job planning and bird guiding me for three days in West Bali and the upland area near Lake Buyan. I got to see many scarce birds including all of my target species. Even when we were hit by pouring rain, we managed to find a few more birds!
Made is an excellent and safe driver. Lunches were excellent and plenty of water was provided. Next visit to Bali I‚Äôm looking forward to staying at his family‚Äôs Homestay with his mother‚Äôs beautiful garden.
Top notch!"
