If you love solitude, you will love it here. If you have been tired of luxuries and noise in a busy area, you will love it here.

Japanese manual brew tastes the same as in Japan.

Espresso Peach Squash smells super good, a little bit too sweet which you can tell the barista to reduce the sweetness a bit.

Matcha shake is yummy and perfect for the afternoon‚Äôs hot weather.

This place is small but great coffee quality

The service is fast.

There is a co-working space which is cool as well.","Beautiful and cozy mini cafe that gives you a rustic nostalgic vibes out of the hectic city. Good coffee and their food was delicious. Reasonable price. Moreover, a very friendly owner Mr.Rizky, gives plenty of place and food suggestions for tourist. Such a great place!","She Poison Coffee is tucked away from the main road, but it's still relatively easy to find. The parking space is not very expansive, so if you're driving, you might need to look for alternative parking. The cafe itself is small but cozy, and the speed of food service is quite decent.

They have a small bookshelf, which adds a nice touch to the ambiance. As it's a cafe, the menu doesn't offer a wide variety of large meals, but it's perfect for a relaxed hangout. Moreover, there's a dedicated space for those who want to ""Work from Cafe,"" and they provide Wi-Fi. The restroom is small but comfortable and clean, rounding up the experience.",A amazing cafe with chill vibes ! Great food and a fantastic coffee ü§óü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§© thanks !,Cute little spot in a village. The food was tasty and prices reasonable but portions were a bit small. Coffee was nice. No complaints. Small indoor space was semi air conditioned and outside had smokers but it was not really busy so no problems. Will visit again.

Please rethink your hire choices as I‚Äôm sure other customers would not appreciate being treated this way.
Travelling from Australia, this is not how you would treat your customers. The drinks were nice. Food was average and could be better but was good.
Will not be coming back and would recommend people find a different place to eat when they are visiting the zoo.",Came in to purchase a pizza only to be told they were sold out. Ordered a different item and 20minutes later a family receives a pizza at their table. This family had ordered after my partner and I had ordered. Not sure why we weren't allowed to order it. The cashier was also quite arrogant and rude. She would be talking to her co-worker while serving us. Not happy with this place and would gladly not come here again.,"Girl order matcha and rice bowl, matcha was low quality, rice bowl was normal.

When we sit sofa and table was dirty, pizza so so, rice bowl fine",Amazing here!!
