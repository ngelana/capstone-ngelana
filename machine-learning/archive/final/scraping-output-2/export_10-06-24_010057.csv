All the places on the iterinary are all good and they can make special arrangement depends on the activity you want to to there. I had a great time in Bali and please extend my thank you to Heri Yakuza. He is good tour guide and with great photography skills. üôÇ
As a solo female traveller, i felt safe even I am in the country where i dont know anyone! Till next time üòÉ","At first I was skeptical to use a local tour company but the tours and pricing Bali Golden Tour offered suited us. I contacted the company via WhatsApp and was able to speak to Wayan straight away. He was very prompt in responding and providing me with a detailed itinerary. He was very professional in every way.
I then received a message from Oka who was responsible in the allocation of drivers and is the main contact for any issues the day before my tour advising me the driver‚Äôs name and a photo of the driver.
We received a message on the morning of the tour to inform us that our driver has arrived at our hotel lobby.
Oka has been very attentive and helpful with our tour needs when I contacted him and I can‚Äôt thank him enough!
Febri our driver was super amazing!! He made our tour so enjoyable and he was also such a great photographer as he was with us during the whole trip/walk of the Waterfalls Tour. He was so helpful and very accommodating to all our requests.
I highly recommend Bali Golden Tours.","I done the wonderful thing in bali is booking my trip with Bali Golden tour. We are 4 family members travelled bali in December. Trip operator took care of us very well from  day one to last day of the tour. Each and every questions are clarified immediately and they flexible to customize the trip schedule. We got great Driver Gade Andika, he is so patience with us and provided lot of information about Bali and their lifestyle. I will much recommend this driver to everyone.","We selected Bali Golden tour as our tour partner in Bali by seeing good reviews and rating in Google. This was our first international trip and we were a  little apprehended about selecting a tour operator from Bali which is totally unknown to us. But from landing at Bali and till leaving, our driver Mr. Tyson was amazing. We booked Car charter. Mr. Tyson was extremely polite and punctual. He guided us to cover various tourist attractions in our limited time. Bali Golden Tour operators were  prompt in replying our queries through Whats app chat. We do strongly recommend Bali Golden tour for a safe and cost effective tour experience in Bali. Thank you Tyson and Bali Golden Tour for your wonderful service.","If you going to Bali...go with bali golden tours. They are reliable, efficient, professional, friendly....Arta is the best driver...I choose him and BGT every time I go to Bali...and this year will be no different. There tours are easy going, fun and value for money. ƒπove BGT üòä"
