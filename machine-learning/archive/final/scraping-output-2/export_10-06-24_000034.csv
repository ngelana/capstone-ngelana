Best experience in Bali so far I think. Dude gave us a tour of all the different plants (vanilla, cinnamon, coffee, etc. etc.) and then showed us how the spices are processed and we could smell & taste them. Then showed us the animal that is used for luwak coffee and at the end you get 10 free coffee/teas to try and you can order the ones you like most. Very cool experience, our host was very chill and spoke good English. Coffee and teas were nice and the atmosphere was great from start to finish. You can buy the coffee & tea to take back home at the end, around 100k for a small box so if you want gifts expect to pay 300-1000k. Drinks were around 50k","Amazing experience. Arrived at the gate and was greeted by a guide. The guide showed us around the entire place. Everything from coconut trees, lemongrass plant, cacao trees, cinnamon trees and so much more. We got to see the cats that eat and poop out the coffee beans. Then she showed us where they make the coffee. After that we got to taste everything they had to offer. For the tasting platter we didnâ€™t have to pay anything. We also bought some coffee from the shop that they have.","Hidden in the forest somewhat, this place offers more than just coffee/tea tastings.

Walking through rice patties initially, you make your way around their garden, with a guide who offers an in-depth look at their variety of spices and fruits growing in their plantation.

They have a big cage where they house 2-3 Luwaks. The cage is very clean, a lot of food offering for them but the public is not allowed to touch them. We asked about their treatment of the Luwaks and they said they release them and look after them. Considering animal treatment, it is a better level of treatment than most.

They have a set up where they show the different stages of getting their Balinese Coffee beans ready which is really interesting.

They finish off with a beautiful cafe overlooking the forest with different spots for photo opportunities. The cafe offers their signature 5 tea / 5 coffee tasting which I would highly recommend as well as a lunch menu. The food was great and reasonably priced.

They have a shop just behind the cafe where you can purchase any of the teas/coffees. The shop and cafe accept all major credit cards which is a bonus.

Overall, a perfect spot to unwind, learning about the coffee/tea sector of Bali in about 2-3 hours if you arenâ€™t in a rush.

A little further on,","Nice place for 1-3 hours, Instagram worthy... The tea and coffee packs are very prohibitive as they are not your everyday kind - I bought a 200gr Mangosteen tea costing almost USD10ðŸ˜²take it slow and ask the guide all your queries (free). Good place for an afternoon tea and snapping for IG / social media collection ðŸ˜‰","Super interesting, especially for coffee/cocoa lovers. You see the process behind grinding the coffeee etc, you taste roasted cocoa beans, get tasters of the different coffee and teas. The food is great (tried the sweet potato fries), and the view is phenomenal. The staff are very helpful and kind too!"

Everything was a mass process. We had barely reached the cats and had to move on. The young lady only explained half of it and sent us to the jungle swing first. The tea and coffee tasting came later. The jungle swing was really cool. The guys who show you work really hard, see the video. After that we went to the tea and coffee tasting. It was very good. After that we went on..","You can try a dozen of coffee taste in this place.
Then you should fly to the sky by bali swing. That is awesome","Stunning location, delicious and generous coffee and tea tasting, plus an educational experience",Great explanation and coffee,

Dek and his wife were amazing hosts who were so attentive and helpful throughout my entire stay with their great communication and hospitality with booking taxis, massages, tours and meals.

The air bnb is a lot bigger than it looks in photos and has ample lighting, WiFi, AC and SPACE! The design is very earthy and homey and the hot tub is so fun in that stone bath (they do flower baths here and it was my favorite!). The stone bath is also the main shower so this is great for couples or solo adventurers!

The outside area has a breathtaking view of the jungle with the nets, swing and the best part is you can move the bed outside easily by sliding it! Itâ€™s sooo unique to hang out in the mornings there! Thereâ€™s also filtered water and enough dishwater. They even have Netflix so you have everything in the middle of the jungle! Highly recommend as this was an amazing getaway. There is a pool in the front that is very refreshing. There are stairs to get into the place and itâ€™s at the end of a very steep driveway but itâ€™s so worth it. This was an amazing place!",,,,
