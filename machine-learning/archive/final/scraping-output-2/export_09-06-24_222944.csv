Next to us - and to our absolute delight - a local fitness team celebrated the birthday of one of its members with laid-back Karaoke. I could imagine that this place generally is more quiet, but the fact that these things can happen alone is worth 5 stars for the ambiance.
The food itself was amazing. We went for the classics with Nasi Campur and Nasi Goreng which were so good that I had to order another round Goreng. We received some free fruit with the food while the table next to us continued taking group photos and singing along to what I can only describe as Balinese 90s pop ballads.
Needless to say, we loved this place.","great place, good people, tasty foods",great,Good place,
