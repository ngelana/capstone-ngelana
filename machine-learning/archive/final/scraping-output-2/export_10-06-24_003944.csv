These drums can be familiar to you if you have visited historical museums in mainland Southeast Asia, such as in Vietnam or Thailand, hosting Dong Son drums. This one is said to have been made locally in around 300 BC. The keeper at the entrance has a one page story and info on it in French, entrance was 20k. 2 minutes from the archeological museum. Oh and contrary to most Balinese temples, this is full of really old (9-14th century) sculptures of deities, although not in a great shape.","My first temple on Bali üáÆüá©. Cost 50k with huge entrance üÖøÔ∏è. Many people in latest hours, so it‚Äôs better to go in the morning.","Penataran Sasih Temple is located in Pejeng Village, you can access this temple by bus, car and motorbike. The facilities provided include a parking area and toilets. Inside the Penataran Sasih temple area we can see Balinese architecture, ancient statues, and also the moon as the icon of Penataran Sasih Temple. there we can pray, take pictures, and learn the history of the Penataran Sasih temple. in the area around the temple we can buy balinese food like babi guling, lawar and also tipat cantok. for opening hours from 8 am to 4 pm. to enter there, you don't have to pay for an entrance ticket, but you must wear a sarong.",Nothing special here. There are some nicely carved wood alters. Paid 50 for admission and a sarong. There was nobody visiting the temple the entire time I was there.,Extensive temple complex close to central Ubud. 2 000 rupiah and the loan of a sarong if necessaryand yyou get to wander at leisure round the various parts of this attraction.

Unfortunately there is a major construction project of a 150 room hotel going on right next door so it is not the peaceful place surrounded by tranquil rice patties that we were expecting due to construction workers hammering away all day. If you are just using it as a base camp to go explore, you will be fine since the construction ends in the evening.",There's not much more to say than simply amazing. Wyan and JJ are two of the nicest and most helpful people I have ever met. The property is beautiful.  Just far enough from Ubud to feel remote but close enough to get in and out of for dinner and exploring. Excellent breakfast with coffe and tea every morning We stayed 3 nights and decided to venture north for a few days. Wayan was kind enough to let us store our bags and even open up another villa for us for an additional night upon our return. We got to experience two of these amazing villas on our trip. We would have stayed longer if the trip would have allowed for it. Highly recommend and we will for sure stay again next time we visit.,"He has 2 types of villas, 2 large private villas and 2 small rooms, with a communal swimming pool... these rooms are rented to the arbnb for a very expensive! In short, this is a guesthouse with mold and termites at the price of a villa.

I don't recommend this place, it's expensive and damp for such housing.","The best place we stayed at during our trip to Bali! Location is kinda in the middle of nowhere! But that‚Äôs what we wanted! It‚Äôs in the middle of farmers rice fields, but it made it that much prettier to walk in the morning. Service was outstanding, they have motor bikes to rent or will call you a personal driver. Everything is really reasonably priced.
The bathtub is awesome and shared pool (just the other villa) is also gorgeous. There is also really good breakfast provided very morning!"

Good wifi.","Had a great stay here when I first arrived in Bali, host was very accommodating, can help organise tours etc, hire scooter, area was kept clean by staff,they will also clean your room daily if you want, pool was nice.
Extended my stay by 2 nights.
Will return again.
Thank you Julius..","This hotel setting is absolutely gorgeous, set in the forest, with a lovely (and very clean) pool. The grounds are immaculate, carefully maintained, and well care for. The cottages / bungalows are surrounded by nature in a peaceful location. If you love nature, this is it. However, if you dislike all kinds of flying or crawling critters, then it's best to look for another hotel in town. After all, the retreat is surrounded by jungle that many critters call home, and we're invading their territory. The location is also far from town. A scooter is a must or suffer the Ubud traffic congestion if you need a Grab. The cottages are pretty bare, though: a bed, a table, 1 small bedside table, and 1 closet with a couple of hangers. No ornaments, no bedside lights, just the bare necessities, which is very surprising considering it's called a suite, and the regular online price. We got a substantial discount, which made our experience reasonable. But at the regular price, it'd be bad value for money.
The bathroom is quite spacious, with a powerful shower and pkenty of really hot water. It also provides shampoo and shower gel. But there is nowhere to set your toiletries around the sink, and the lighting above the mirror is poor. There is also no socket close to the bathroom , so drying and styling your hair is a work of art without the use of a mirror.
It is also not recommended for wheelchairs or people with walking difficulties as the stairs are quite high.
There is also an open shared kitchen with a small eating area, kept immaculate by the staff. You can cook your meals and make coffee or tea; the hotel also provides a water dispenser. Everything is kept super clean.
To summarize: Sanga Suites is a great place for nature lovers who want to relax and enjoy the beautiful environment. The rooms are pretty basic and smell of mold, and the location is rather far from the center, which necessitates transportation, thus facing the horrendous Ubud traffic saturation.","A nice place to stay if you‚Äôre looking for a quiet getaway. Located real close to the nature, only 5 minutes away from rice fields and there are waterfalls around the area.","Cheap, but not the best. The room is big, not really clean but it works out, though the bath is dirty and the shower is really moldy.
There was also a rat in the roof and it could get into the room through a hole, which was more than unpleasant.
The location is 15 min to Ubud per scooter or Gojekt Taxi, which is allright."

Excellent guides. Great experience. Must do for those who love a little exercise and experience the local scenery. Thank you for an awesome day!,"A very disappointing experience to say the least. We were picked up at 8am and did not get to start out ride until after 12.30pm. Breakfast was served at 11.30am. Only choice- rice or noodles. When the food came, we had to eat it in a fly infested area. The views were spectacular but no one took the time to tell us where we were or what we were looking at.
When we eventually started the ride, it was relatively easy- hardly used the pedals. Most was down hill.
The guides were either Leading or at the end. No one knew where we were or what we were riding past. Very disappointing, as some of the views were stunning.
There were 2 very serious falls. The guides only had band aids and a small bottle of betadine. One rider had to be taken to hospital while the other was given a bandage (from another rider) and patched up. They will need to see a doctor on their return to their accommodation.
We got to our lunch destination around 3.30pm. The food was cold.
We left around 4pm and it took 2 hours for us to get home (Seminyak). We were the first dropped off Kuta & Nusa Dua to go. No air con in the car as the driver informed us they were running out of petrol...
Overall, a very disappointing and underwhelming experience. Lots of stunning views but no one took the time to tell us what they were.
Do not recommend  - please look for other options..",Had a wonderful day today. The scenery through the villages and rice fields was spectacular. Our guide was great and very attentive as was our driver. Lunch wad delicious.  Would definitely recommend this tour
