People are lovely. Delicious meal. Young girls performed a traditional dance which was fantastic. They were so cute.,"I visited the village with my wife.
We had an amazing experience getting to know the local people, understanding their customs and traditions and eating authentic Balinese food (was delicious).

The music was wonderful as well as the balinese dances.
We had the chance to see how people grow rice and we had the opportunity to plow the land with cows.

Highly recommend it!",It was absolutely amazing experience full of positive energy which beams from Rai (the owner) and his family. You really have an opportunity tho see how Balinese people live and learn about their customs and religion as well as to understand what Balinese way of living is. We saw Balinese school and we met Rai's neighbours and family members. I felt there like at home or even little paradise. Unforgettable experience!,"We're back from ANOTHER ""awesome"" Balinese experience!!!

I highly suggest and recommend the Balinese Village Tour for any one who appreciates culture, traditions, and seeing the similarities & differences within one's own culture.
We were treated to a generous portion of Balinese food. The driver & family were so friggin' cool!!","Tuesday cultural tour covered so many things from cooking Sates, coconut oil  coffer roasting, pandan desert making, holy procession, talk on their compound living, schools, etc etc. Lunch
The best!!!"

They have a few dishes on their menu and some with fresh water fish like carp and tilapia.

The place has a view over paddy field which gives you a wonderful breeze.","Enjoyed my veggies with rice.  As westerner maybe portion was slightly to small but I don't need to overeat anyway lol.  Taste was good and the place has a nice view that allows a breeze in.  If your headed to or from Ubud this is a good stop.  Prices are reasonable as you'd expect.  Cap Cay, steam rice, bottle water about 50k","Overall, a beautiful dining experience! The food is so good and it is affordable. It's way better than other expensive restaurants I tried in Bali. Delicious Balinese food, truly! It's what I had during my last night in Bali and how I wished I have known it earlier so we can eat there more often. Their gourami is fresh and everything we ordered is flavorful. I already recommended this to my friends. The owner/manager who also happens to drive us around the city is also kind, accommodating & friendly. The staff is kind too. The place is cozy too.. Definitely worth a visit, see you again soon! ü´∂üèº",Very tasty Gurami and Mujair (Fish) and most excellent Nasi Goreng Bumbuh Bali! Nice ricefield view and relaxed atmosphere!,Best local food that had over the last 18 years in Bali. And the prices are incredibly low. I will come back for sure.
