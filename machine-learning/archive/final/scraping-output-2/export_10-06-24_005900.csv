Those who say it can be walked through in 30 minutes must have visited a different park or are simply not interested in birds. It's an amazing place! There are many beautiful birds, lots of interactive activities, you can feed parrots, pelicans, and other birds, and there are interesting shows almost every hour.

I express my immense gratitude to the staff of the Bird Park for their work and love for animals. The sincere smiles and care are reflected in the birds: they look very healthy, active, and sociable, which is very pleasing. Thank you so much! I sincerely wish that all zoos in the world would become like this, if possible. It‚Äôs wonderful that there is information everywhere about the harm of plastic to birds, which is equally important.

I must also mention that the park has clean restrooms and sinks with water and soap everywhere. You can get a free coffee or souvenir for completing an online survey. There are umbrellas at the caf√© in case of rain.

The ticket price for tourists is fully justified. After purchasing and visiting the park, I realized that all the money spent goes to the well-deserved salaries of the staff and the health of the birds.
Thank you again! ü¶ú","It's just a really nice park. You can walk or sit around watching different birds. But there are also a lot of activities, where you can interact with birds, it's a lot of fun, so we ended up spending 4 hours there (I guess we could've spent even more hours there, if we've got there earlier)
With your ticket you get a brochure with a map of the park and activities schedule.
You can go there early in the morning and stay there until ~13:30, or come at ~13 or 12:30 and stay almost until it's closed. There is a place to eat there. Some ponds, trees and a lot of different birds. I think it's a great place to go with kids, but even if you're not a child you'll have a great time there (if you like birds)","Really great park. Opens at 9am which is nice and early to avoid the heat. It‚Äôs well maintained, has great information plagues, and the animals are well cared for. The ‚Äòhigher‚Äô entrance ticket feels like it‚Äôs being utilised well in maintaining and investing into this park. Approx 38,000 for adult and half price for children (2-12 from memory). We spent two hours here and was a real highlight for our toddler and the grandparents.

Located next door to the reptile park (seperate tickets) this makes for a great activity / day.

We really enjoyed.","We arrived just before the last bird show that happened in the caf√© area. It turned out to be very exclusive as only a handful of people were present. We got very close to some incredible exotic birds and even had a few landing on us just for the fun of it.
The park is well maintained, and birds look healthy.
If you take your time, you will find yourselves noticing a few interesting flowers and a komodo  dragon or 2.","Beautiful combination of open space bird interactions and globally regional aviaries, over 200 species of healthy birds. Many interactive shows exhibiting natural bird behaviors, we walked around 3.5 mi snacking in between roaming and pouring rain. They have umbrellas for visitors anf plenty of restrooms and snack spots with reasonable prices. Gift shop at entrance/exit. Plenty of grab availability for local in and out transport."

Tour guides were great and very knowledgeable.","Totally loved the visit. So many different variety of reptiles. When you enter to this place you can see a giant iguana and an Anaconda.you can hold them and take pictures. They are pet. Nothing to worry. Loved the experience. There is a tortoise section. Where you can see 50+age tortoise and iguana. Different species. Variety of indonesian snakes.
Lot many picture places. And the crocodile they have happy and lucky must ask the trainer to feed them and you can also volunteer yourself. We fed them chicken.","Really great way to spend a few hours. The grounds are beautiful, the animals are well cared for and your entry fee includes a guide. Our guide was Gung Nanda and he was fantastic! He really made what would have been a good experience, a great experience. Highly recommend if you love animals!","Incredible reptile park with excellent staff which are so helpful and friendly. The park is very unique, well maintained and in excellent condition. Ticket price is 200k per person and this includes your own guide to explain all the many different species of reptiles.
From a great range of snakes, monitor lizards, skinks, crocodiles to turtles there will be something for everyone to enjoy.

It's a captivating performance filled with vibrant costumes and expressive movements.

Seraya Budaya Bali is an excellent place for entertainment. Located in Bali, it offers a rich cultural experience with traditional Balinese dance performances, music, and art exhibitions. Visitors can immerse themselves in the beauty of Balinese culture and enjoy top-notch entertainment in a serene setting.",Best place To see barong and Kriss dance in BALI.,"Good experience to witness the dance and local tradition!
The show is about 40 minutes including dancing, acting, however, it could have been better with more dancing than just acting !","Before the performance, we are greeted with a small musical performance using these bamboo instruments, Suling flute and a Rindik xylophone. And then, voila, whole Barong performance in the morning. It was very great to be honest and I would come back here to see the Kecak dance (if I can, I want to visit Bali again this time with my relatives because I visited this place with classmates and teachers). Only thing missing is the extra sound systems for the Gamelan, if the gamelan got some microphones in it then the whole performance would be extra immersive. Awesome place, awesome dancers and great aminities as well. A trip to Bali is never complete without watching the traditional dances!"

We had just been grocery shopping in the (s)mall opposite and wanted some lunch, didn't fancy the food hall inside the mall.
This restaurant was empty when we got there at 2pm but we sat down and immediately enjoyed the strong breeze and the stunning view over the rice padifields right outside. Even though it is right next to the main road, once you sit down and listen to the gentle Balinese music playing you get swept away by the atmosphere of the place.
The food was carefully prepared and delicious. We ordered the Chinese omelette which was crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. Mie ayam was a huge portion generously filled with vegetables and beansprouts.
Service was warm and friendly and the owner's 2 year old son kept our kids amused by playing with them. So enchanting! We'll be back üòä","beautiful view!! Good pork satay and ayam betutu.

After checking out 3 places, finally we decided to purchase a hand-carved stone Buddha, stone pots, stone lantern and stone bird bath from this shop. The owner speaks perfect English and is very knowledgeable of stone products (and other beautiful Balinese products as well). We were worried to ship such heavy items to USA, but the process was easy. The items arrived in USA three months later (longer than we thought) in perfect condition, it‚Äôs worth the wait. Now we have a piece of Bali in our home. We love all the pieces more every day. We highly recommend Yuli for your stone shopping in Bali.","the craftmanship and authenticity are second to none and the service (we had the statues shipped from Indonesia to UK) is excellent. Good information about manufacturing and shipping and, generally, a pleasure to deal with.","We had the most incredible experience sourcing and creating the most breathtaking pieces from Bali with the assistance of this amazing team! From the moment we arrived in this enchanting island, they were dedicated to making our dreams a reality.

Their expert knowledge of Bali and its rich artistic traditions allowed us to explore hidden gems and uncover unique treasures that we simply couldn't have found on our own. Leaving us more time to relax and enjoy while they did the work.

What truly set this experience apart was their exceptional communication and personalized service. Even when we returned to Los Angeles, they remained in constant contact, going above and beyond to transform our wish list into an absolute dream come true. Through text and phone calls, they carefully curated a collection that perfectly captured our aesthetic and exceeded our expectations.

The pieces we brought back are nothing short of magnificent. Each item tells a story, beautifully crafted with meticulous attention to detail. The memories of our time in Bali will forever be intertwined with these extraordinary creations, reminding us of the remarkable journey we embarked upon together.

I cannot recommend this team highly enough. Their passion, expertise, and unwavering commitment to excellence ensure that each piece they source and create is imbued with a sense of magic and authenticity. If you're searching for a truly exceptional experience, allow them to guide you on a journey that will leave you breathless and inspired.","We bought 2 statues and were not even there in person. They made the entire process so easy and reliable. Highly recommend them if looking for amazing, high quality statues.","The moment I bought my villa in Bali I knew I wanted some beautiful stone carving pieces for my villa. With a quick google  ""best stone carving in Bali"" I quickly found ""Yuli Yudhistira Stone carving"". Reading the reviews written by the happy customers  which raved about the stunning works they bought there and the excellent service offered from the owner, Dhian, I drove to Ubud to check it out.
As soon as I arrived there I was absolutely stunned by so many fantastic pieces I saw at their big shop. Meeting the lovely Dhian was also a bonus and he was very helpful discussing my ideas and the pieces that I wanted. Which size, kind of stone etc. At the end of our meeting I ordered a large seated Buddha (for the border of my pool), plus two big standing Goddess Tara to each side of my entrance door. I also had a photo of an elephant family surrounded by frangipanis which I had found at the internet and I asked Dhian to reproduce it in a large stone panel for my wall.
Two months later I got a call from Dhian saying my pieces were ready for delivery. When he sent the photos of the works I was extremely happy with the result. They were even better than what I had imagined!
I have to say that I am a designer, a perfeccionist, a customer very hard to please so my expectations are generally extremely high.
Dhian organised with his very helpful and kind staff to drive to my Villa and install all the pieces in the places I had planned. This happened twice as it couldn't be done in only one trip.
Having those stunning works in my villa make me happy every single time I look at them. All my friends also commented on them.
I could not recommend enough Yuli Yudhistira! Their work is superb! They are real artists with incredible craftsmanship and attention to detail. You'll be lucky to have one of their pieces at home."
