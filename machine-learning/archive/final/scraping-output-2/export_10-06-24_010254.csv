Especially the dim sum, the udang keju (cheese shrimp), that's my favorite, they're very tasty!üç•
The downside of this place is the inconsistency in the seasoning of the mie angle (since I always eat mie angel here, Idk with other variants). Sometimes the taste is just right, but other times it's not salty enough. And If you come in the evening, it's very glaring, that's all.

Overall, this place is worth adding to your list of places to visit, especially for those who admire noodle dishes.",Awesome food! Loved the outlet. This is stop2 on our Bali Mie Gacoan tour ü§©,"I'm a traveler. food was served quickly. Even it's level one, it was a bit spicy. Food was cheap and delicious.
