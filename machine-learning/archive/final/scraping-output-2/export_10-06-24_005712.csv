I wanted to have a tea party and I requested a special menu of finger bites. The kitchen was extremely creative and crafted a menu that blew away my guests! The space was gorgeous, all my guests raved about how perfect the spot is.

We had such a fun time together, and it was all made possible by the team at Laut Cafe! The service was excellent, the food came out plated to perfection, and they even played a special playlist I created for the party!

They helped me organize a welcome drink for my guests at the last minute, and were so flexible and accommodating.

I'm really happy with their service and I'm obsessed with their beer bread! On their regular menu, I've had their Maultasche, Schupfnudeln with the most delicious sauerkraut and tempeh bits, and Mushroom Toast. All are excellent! Genuinely packed with flavor and cooked with intention.

Thank you Laut Cafe for everything! I can't wait to see you again soon.","Not my first time here, but the food still amazingly yummy. From pretzel to their traditional vegetarian friendly KÃ¤sespÃ¤tzle, was completely delicious (reminds me of Germany), immer lecker. Humble staffs, cozy atmosphere and yet located at kedungu in Tabanan.",New hidden gem ðŸ’Ž in Kedungu. Find authentic vegetarian ðŸŒ± German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª cuisine here. The owners are a super nice German couple who make you feel home immediately. The menu offers different German classics for lunch and plenty of breakfast options. Donâ€™t miss the Apfelsaftschorle (apple juice with soda water) ðŸ˜» so refreshing,"This place is newest addition to the greater Kedungu area. Located in pangkung Tibah on a quiet road a charming atmosphere you can get lost in.  The coffee is  absolutely top notch.  We both had cappuccinoâ€¦ one regular and the other with oat milk. Both delicious and charming just like the place and the owners.   The milk art was reminded me of a folk art version of your typical pattern on a cappuccino you find common everywhere.

This place is plant based German cuisine. It very bold to start a restaurant with a plant based food format as it is not serving the masses. But that is what makes this place so so cool. Itâ€™s like they donâ€™t mind being themselves and confident in their offering. I think itâ€™s wonderful addition to our community.

Btw, the banana bread was full of flavor without glutinous and the texture was smooth without being mushyâ€¦ which is hard to do.  Iâ€™m so glad I found this place and wish the lovely young couple best wishes.","Lovely spot with vegetarian German food! Very unique menu, but everything is fresh and tasted amazing!
The spot is also tacked away from everything and is very chill."
