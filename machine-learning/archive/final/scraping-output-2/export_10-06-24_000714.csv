Hidden, less known rice terraces. You can take a beautiful walk in the terraces and enjoy the scenary all by yourself. Locals are friendly and will greet you along your walk. Highly recommend this place compared to other rice terraces which are crowded and touristy.",Saw this place on instagram and wanted to take the same shot! I was surprised that there were no more tourists (actually really happy about that)! One of the more beautiful little streets in Bali through the rice fields. I think it‚Äôs the most beautiful during the golden hour. The locals there are also soo friendly!,"Amazing place, quiet, plenty of rice fields and with a special charm. People is incredibly nice. The visit is trully recommended here. It is free of charge, but a donation at the entrance will help them keep all nice and clean.","One of the stretches of rice fields with rows of the most beautiful coconut trees in Bali, the view of the sunrise is also very charming..",Morning and evening are good time to visit.

The Bambootel is definitely a place to be. From the bamboo architecure to every little detail makes this experience unique.
I want to highlight the magnificient and attentive staff of the hotel, always willing to help and make the stay unforgettable.
The Villas are absolutely stunning and facing a landscape that makes the whole place even more alive.
The extra experiences they offer are a good way to connect with the local culture and to contribute to the economic activity of the area, since everything they offer is from little businesses and households.

Thanks Bambootel for making our stay an unforgettable experience and for being an ally to my friend‚Äôs birthday surprise!",Absolutely a spectacular place! Bamboo villas have amazing interior design and come with a private pool or hot tube. Every single detail is made of bamboo and the rice field view is stunning. The breakfast and the dinner were also so good. Definitely a unique experience!,"The most amazing hidden gem in Bali! This was definitely the highlight of the trip. Not only was all the staff so kind, attentive and helpful, but the ambiance itself was outstanding. Never been to a more unique and beautiful hotel as this. Amazing food and drinks as well! Will highly recommend to everyone I know and I can‚Äôt wait to come back.","Luxushotel in the dschungel

We stayed at the Bambootel in February 2024 and therefore took advantage of the ""pay 2 stay 3"" offer.
We had already spent 20 days in Bali and the surrounding islands before that.
As soon as we arrived, we were impressed by the service and the breathtaking entrance.
We were amazed as we explored the villa and the grounds. It should be noted that the hotel is currently still undergoing expansion and construction work. However, the staff make sure that you don't notice this. It is by no means disruptive.

We were upgraded. We were very pleased with this and were delighted by the great dishes with refinement.

The hotel offers a daily one-hour tour through the rice fields where you learn a lot about life in the fields. The rooms are cleaned twice a day and in the evening you can snuggle up in the cozy bed.

Overall, it can be said that Bambootel shines with its extremely courteous staff, who are attentive and always go the extra mile.

We would definitely come back again.","Absolutely breathtaking sunset upon arrival facing the view, then followed up the most magical sunrise via drone looking in the other way from afar! The morning mist covered the jungle surrounding the resort + the water reflection on the rice terrace was just pure magic! Staffs were helpful and hospitable! Thank you for the perfect stay!"

The food here was outstanding, even better than the highly reviewed local restaurants we tried. Every meal was a delight, full of fresh and flavorful ingredients.

The staff were tremendously kind and accommodating, always going out of their way to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. Their warm hospitality truly made us feel at home.

The villa itself is situated in a beautiful and picturesque location. We loved waking up to breathtaking views and enjoying the serene surroundings. It was the perfect setting for a relaxing getaway.

A nice bonus was the amazing laundry service. Our clothes came back smelling great, and even our swimming shorts were pressed to perfection!

Tampak Siring is a lovely location with so much to offer. There are plenty of cultural attractions and environmental gems to explore nearby. We had a wonderful time discovering the area's rich history and natural beauty.","Living in Bali long term, it was a real pleasure to enjoy the nature surroundings and coziness of the hotel. Waterfall, tubing and great rice fields at a working distance.
Will definitely be in the list of recommendations for my next visitors in Bali.","This place is real magic. Breathtaking view on the valley, beautiful gardens and very well designed stunning and cozy joglos. The food is just perfect, they put a lot of thought and care into ingredients and plating. And the staff is wonderful - they treat you like family! Definitely one of the most remarkable experiences I‚Äôve had in Bali!",Hidden Gem around Ubud. We spent very peaceful time here. Amazing view to the ricefield. Fresh air in the morning. Very nice pool. A place to relax!,"Amazing, authentic, and peaceful nature experience less than an hours drive north from Ubud. You are very close to the Tirta Empul water temple and ancient Gunung Kawi Temple. Yet withdrawn in the midst of the jungle and with magnificent views (and sunset) over the rice fields. Great walks in the local rice fields, a swimming pool overlooking the jungle and fields. Beautiful cottages, facilities and staff. Great tasting food too. Will definitely return."

If you want to see Bali you must stay here.,"We were happy with our stay - it felt like home, offering a genuine taste of Bali. The owners were incredibly kind.ü´∂üèª",It was the most lovely experience. When we arrived it was heavily raining and the family (+ the dog) welcomed us with hot tea. The rest of the stay we bonded a lot with the family and the dog and had good chats + very delicious food. They also took us a view times on their bikes to bring us to other places (for free!). Their kindness and openness is stunning. Also the ambience at the place is a absolut 10/10 if you want to stay at a quite place. Would come back anytime when visiting Bali!,"If you want to stay in this area, you definitely need ti go there. The best guesthouse I ever been!  ü•≥‚ù§
Tutik will give you a warm welcome and some great advises about the area. She's also a great cooker!
Also, speak to Nyoman, great dancer and very interesting person.
Perfect location, 15m by walk from the mains attractions, and near by the others by bike! Their dog will guide you!
The house is magnificient, an experience in itself! Beautiful garden, large room and comfortable beds.
You must stay at Tangkas House!",We came here by accident. We booked a hotel in the same street 1 day later than we thought. So we were brought to this beautiful and welcoming place. The people are amazing and kind and they cook amazing meals. We also had the luck that we made some local friends because of tangkas house. After one night we went to the place where we where supposed to be (dewi tara). But after that we went back for one more night at tangkas because we loved it so much. You can also rent a bike and scooter to all the nearby tempel en waterfalls. So if you want to get in contact with the local people and and experience the real bali life you must go to tangkas house.
