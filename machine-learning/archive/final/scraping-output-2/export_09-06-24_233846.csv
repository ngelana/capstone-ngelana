Tegallalang, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80561, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=5990449620951042430,OPERATIONAL,+62 852-1122-1669,food,"tourist_attraction, farm, food",5,1307,,"Best cooking class I have ever experienced!!!

The farm itself is based on an incredibly scenic area, surrounded by the jungle with beautiful palm trees and nature all around. Visiting the local market (AM class only), picking our own ingredients that were organically grown on the farm and getting hands on with traditional methods of blending spices together, allowed us to fully immerse ourselves into the experience.

The cooking instructors were simply fantastic! Both men were very welcoming, entertaining and helpful. The details they provided regarding cooking instructions and information about the ingredients, were very professional, helpful and super informative. They were also kind enough to offer fruits for breakfast, beverages throughout the day and mosquito repellent for everyone (be prepared if you‚Äôre like me and mozzzzis love you, keep yourself covered with repellent as I got eaten alive - antihistamine saved the day!). Staff were quick to clear tables once each course was finished, they also assisted with cooking and cleaned the work surfaces rapidly ensuring a tidy area at all times.

Dietary requirements are welcomed here and suitable substitutes for egg / meat and dairy are used. The only point I would make, is that both the meat and the vegan / veggie dishes were cooked the same grill. Even though we made sure they didn‚Äôt touch, a separate grill would ensure that were was no cross contamination. There was also no oat milk available however, we were given coconut cream and palm sugar for our tea & coffee which was actually a really nice alternative.

Lastly, the cooking / dining environment, as well as the toilets were very clean. This overall made everything a much better experience.

Overall a day well spent. I couldn‚Äôt recommend anymore! Thank you guys :)","This was by far the best cooking class I ever had! Everything tasted so good and the staff was lovely. We started with a market tour where we could try lots of different fruits. After that we harvested our own vegetables in the organic garden. We worked in teams of two, so everyone could cook everything. The Farm is so nice, you have a wonderful few while eating. I would love to come here again.","A must-do when in Bali! Such a fun experience. The staff were all so friendly, and took the time to explain all the ingredients and how to make each dish, providing any help when needed! They first showed us around the traditional Balinese market, then around their farm where we were able to pick out some of the vegetables required for the meals, and then showed us how to cook 6 different dishes. The food was exceptional and they provide recipes for each dish too! They were also very accommodating to any dietary requirements. I would definitely recommend ! Thank you so much Bali Farm Cooking for the incredible experience - can‚Äôt wait to attempt these meals at home ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§§","GREAT vegan and vegetarian options for the same price as the meat eater menu!

The staff were really friendly and very helpful and devoted to their teaching of cooking

The cats Nagi and Nugget were adorable and the atmosphere and building itself was humble and a well kept garden!

Market tour was so cool and they gave us complimentary fruit to try along with cakes","This was such an amazing experience! With the morning class we got to go to the market and then the farm to learn about and get some of the ingredients we cooked with. The staff and instructors were so kind and knowledgeable, answering all of our questions and showing us all of the techniques. The farm is so peaceful and beautiful. They gave us breakfast and we made a 6-course lunch. There was so much food and everything was delicious! Definitely wear bug spray as there are a lot of mosquitoes in the jungle (they have extra if you need it). And they transport you to and from Ubud. It's amazing how much you get for the money! I would recommend this to anyone who likes to cook or wants to learn more about Balinese cuisine."
