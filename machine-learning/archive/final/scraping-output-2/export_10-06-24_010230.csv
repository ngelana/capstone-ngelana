Most guests were nice and I felt at home","I've tried many hostels but this is one of the best hostels in Bali! It's located in Canggu which is very close to the city center as well as the beaches. However the surroundings are quiet, away from the traffic hustle of Canggu. The ambience, the staff, the cleanliness is just perfect! It's a great place to make friends with other travellers from around the world.","This was my first ever stay at the hostel and despite issues with aircon on the first night, cold water under the showers, no electricity for almost half a day, issues with drainage, hot water in the swimming pool (jacuzzi?) it was my best stay ever. The stuff is very accommodating, always happy to help with the smile, often would interact with residents and just overall vibes and the community at this hostel was amazing.
Thanks for having me and I honestly hope to come back. All the best to all the staff members. Keep up with great work! Thank you","One of the best hostels I have ever stayed at. The manager Umam, is a gem of a person. An amazing gentleman. Very kind, polite, friendly and always there to help you. I truly had a great experience.

The meatballs were so tender and the prawns were bathed in sauce packed with savoury goodness.

We were so pleased with our foods and so we added on pizza topped with cooked ham and mushrooms, which was also delicious. We love this place as it is where we can find unpretentious and satisfying Italian foods prepared with fresh ingredients.

The food is incredible, the atmosphere is romantic, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The entire menu is Michelin star worthy, but I strongly reccomend trying the pizza here. It's the best that I've had in my life. Even better than any that I had in Italy!","As an Italian I can confirm the food was amazing! The menu is also rich in options and the owner was so friendly, we got to chat about Italy and it was an overall amazing experience, thank you so much!

Here were everything I need: air condition, fridge, towels (new and soft), king-size bed, big bathroom.
Kitchen is full of all necessary equipment.
The pool wasn't too chlorinated.
In general guesthouse quite simple but in it has all necessary as well as any other villa.
But not any villa have such a perfect host!
Wahyu is wonderful! She was so helpful, simpathetic, friendly and her english is really good!

Highly recommended üòä,"I recently dined at RiceFieldResto in Bali and had a bit of a mixed experience. On the positive side, the overall taste of the food was quite satisfactory. Additionally, the garden setting of the restaurant was beautiful, providing a serene and picturesque dining environment.

The staff were friendly and welcoming, which added a nice touch to the overall ambiance. However, despite their friendliness, there were several issues that impacted our dining experience.

Unfortunately, there were some significant service mishaps. Our order was incorrectly served, leading to an unfortunate situation where our son ended up with a spicy dish, which was not suitable for him. This indicated a lapse in attention to detail in serving orders.

Moreover, the restaurant was out of several items we were looking forward to trying, including bananas and spring rolls. This was disappointing and limited our menu choices.

A concerning issue was the small piece of metal we found in our Nasi dish. This is a serious safety hazard that needs immediate attention from the management to ensure it does not happen again.

As for the drinks, the fruit juices, particularly the pineapple juice, were overly diluted and lacked the robust flavor we were expecting. This was a letdown, especially in a tropical setting where fresh fruit should be a highlight.

In summary, while RiceFieldResto offers a delightful setting and friendly service, there are areas that need improvement. Ensuring accurate order serving, maintaining food safety, and enhancing the quality of the beverages could greatly improve the dining experience.","The first time I ate there, the ambiance when I entered the place was like a shop, not a caf√©/resto. It has a good backyard, but the cleanliness is bad. The mirror window wasn't clean, there were a lot of rat, which was bad as a restaurant, the food was so-so. I ordered Tom Yum, and the Tom Yum is good, but the seafood wasn't fresh because I got a stomachache now. The rice wasn't well cooked. When we asked what is the taste of some of the menu, the waitress wasn't helpful at all, looks like a new staff that doesn't have any customer service experience and how to react that kind of question, she answered, ""I just made the food but never taste it, so I don't know how it taste."" Which is unprofessional.
It's too bad that you waste your backyard garden, which is unique, but you need to have a renovation in the front and be aware of your cleanliness, and your staff needs to be trained first. Also you need to check your food freshness if you want to improve your restaurant","The vibe here is amazing, so chill with nice views! The food was nice, but not phenomenal. One of the dishes came unlike the photo which was a bit weird (had no egg), so we had to ask them to fix it. Overall, I would recommend.","Fabulous warung on rice fields.
Loved to try some new dishes here. Beautiful bumbu rice with chicken Tikka masarla plus a taste of seafood skewers. Definitely coming back for the soups and salads. Very relaxing and wonderful service, fresh food. Thankyou!"

3. WITH CHILDREN ITS A NIGHTMARE! No land only water and stones no greens no air to breath

Each bedroom has its own split system so keeps you cool during the warm humid nights.

Tony and Dian cooked us wonderful breakfasts everyday with the biggest smiles on their faces and we cannot thank them enough for what they did for us during our 1 week stay.

It is away from the main area in Canggu but this is the quietness you really want with only 5 min scooter to cafes, bars and restaurants on Batu Balong.

Next to a road with a noisy construction yard across the street.

Argued with the owner over hand soap, hand towels, shampoo, body wash being a basic item for a $1000 a night villa.

Tony is lovely and  hard working but not at the level  required for a $1000 a night villa.

Bathrooms smelled like they were inside the sewer.

A bit run down already, for instance, bathroom doesn't even have a toilet paper holder, sink faucets basically falling off.

Not kid friendly, ever, due to lack of open space and uneven stones. They provided baby cots without a matress so my baby slept the first night on a solid cot frame.

Villa wasn't ready until 5pm+

Even though we begged to let us leave early, host wouldn't negotiate so we left 3 days early without a refund.

Feel scammed by this dump.  Left early to a 5 star villa with 4 staff for half the cost.","By far the best villa as a group of friends we've rented in Bali
From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, this villa guaranteed we had an awesome holiday. The place is such a great size and all the furniture is so stylish, amazing pool and sunbathing areas, so many different terraces and places to hang out, beds super comfy, great size rooms, awesome staff and nothing was too much trouble.
We also loved the location, by not being smack bang in the middle of Canggu really made our holiday, so quiet and tranquil with awesome views out over the rice fields, yet only a couple of mins away from all of the best restaurants in Canggu.
The people who own this villa truly have great style and know what guests want, thank you for what has truly been on every level, our favourite villa ever. We're already looking at dates for our next holiday as we want to book La Masia again, and we know we need to do it soon to ensure availability, as this newly renovated villa will become many peoples favourite place to stay when travelling as a big family or group of friends. We wish you every success, as you deserve it, its so rare to find a super stylish place, in an awesome location, with THE most friendly and helpful staff."

Open view, but still good privacy. Located about 15-20 min drive from Changgu beach. But what makes this villa really special is its staff. Very helpful and friendly, they offer great service and will do what they can to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Also great food prepared by private cook, local or western and the only thing you have to think about is how to spend your day... And if you don't know just stay at the villa with the beautiful garden and pool with jacuzzi... Would definitely recommend a stay here and hope to visit again in the future!","This is a unique one-of-a kind villa in Canggu's Tumbak Bayuh area, located in a quiet spot, but still an easy moped hop to all the action in Berawa, Canggu, Pererenan and West.

4 bedrooms with a small spa room that can double as an extra bedroom, all with ensuite bedrooms facing the pool  deck and gardens.

It's private bar, long dining table, wine cellar, all serenely shaded by huge canvas sails, gives the impression of yachting through paddy fields.","The house is beautiful, but no doubt who made this stay unforgettable was the staff! They are kind, always ready to help and the most lovely people I ever met! Wayan was happy and smiling all the time, the chef is super talented and prepared amazing food, and everyone else was incredible. Couldn't be more grateful for them! Would recommend staying there as long as you can, no regrets at all. Everything was perfect","Quiet location, cozy structure, beautiful rice field view, especially in the afternoon..",The staff are very friendly and helpful. They treated us very well. We felt like we were home.

Very impressive, and this is coming from a Non-Vegan/Vegetarian.

Great for both dine in and online delivery, service is friendly and timely, street parking for both scooters and cars.",I can come here every day! So yum and the restaurant owners are extremely nice and friendly. As a vegetarian this is heaven.,"Absolutely loved that I was able to experience some authentic Indonesian cuisine being vegan with allergies. I am allergic to peanuts, soy and coriander so it was a definite risk for me to try but I let them know and they catered to that. I was served a wee bit of soy but I gave it to my husband. The peanut allergy is the worst (anaphylaxis) and i was safe! Everything was amazing super grateful. Thank you ü•∞","One of the best vegan balinese nasi campur around canggu with affordable price. The soup is really good, there is a kind of meat made from jackfruit. The place is small but the taste is great.","Reasonable vegan foods and tasty
I lost my money but paid them via Grab (pick up) instead. So generous."

The interior is totally modern with concrete and metal. However, the 2 baristas behind the counter made all the difference. They know their coffees and able to elaborate about their coffees.

I had a great experience which I didn‚Äôt expect. Do try the pour over and the special. The beans aroma and the brew results were so amazingly different. The pour-over was impressive, the bean aroma, the cupping, the mouth feel were all different.

The service was friendly and the parking space for cars is nonexistent.","I  absolutely love this coffee shop! The coffee is consistently amazing, and the location is perfect for a cozy catch-up or some quiet work time. The staff is incredibly friendly Dio and Stain and always makes me feel welcome. Definitely my go to spot for a delicious cup of coffee and a warm atmosphere  ü§©","I found this cute little cafe that is a bit up north from the populated Canggu and it‚Äôs definitely worth coming here. The space is just so elegant and nicely decorated, the atmosphere feels very clean and inspiringly, very artsy for sure. The staff was very friendly and the coffee really really good and high quality! I love their cups and the way they present everything, very unique and I will definitely be back!üòç","One of the finest coffee in Canggu, really smooth tastes, pretty strong and delightful. And I like the service too, the crew are really friendly, the place is small but is cozy fully air conditioned, sit back relax and enjoy the coffee.

Feels like sleep on the rock . Many mosquitoes and the last night we stayed , the power was off because the staff forget to check the balance of the power and we need to wait about 3 hours for the power. Overall not bad to say but it's gonna be better if they do some improvement especially for the bed.","We had a lovely stay at Villa Kuncara
It‚Äôs an ideal place to stay with friends and Family and in a good location where we can just travel by scooter for 5 minutes to Batu Bolong beach and restaurants.
A beautifully decorated villa. Everything as expected and more. Cozy enclosed living room is perfect for just having a relaxing or Netflix day with everyone
Every each of rooms are so nice and we couldn‚Äôt stop taking pictures.¬†¬†There cleaning staff is also very sweet and helpful during our stay and the communication was perfect, Nola always fast in responding with anything we need throughout the stay!
We will most definitely be back!! Thank you xxx","The villa is very comfortable, neat and instagrammable. The kind of place where you don‚Äôt want it to just look cute on your ig, but also make you feel at home. They have a nice living room, when you can chill/hang out/work without having to worry about getting wet by the rain, or burn by the heat. The host is very well organized and friendly too. They even give us recommendations to some nice places in Bali. Totally worth every penny!","Really wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying here. I never ever do bad reviews of places however my sister in law and I felt so uncomfortable here. It is infested with bugs in one of the bedrooms, the door was broken, there was a big hole in the bathroom where many bugs kept crawling out of, and in the second bedrooms bathroom was a lot of black mould in there. This villa needs A LOT of fixing and maintenance to be done before others stay here. We booked for 5 nights however we left as soon as possible and only stayed for one night. The villa did not give us a refund for the remaining nights even though they saw the issues first hand and I have many photos that show that the villa has many health hazards. We were so relieved once we got to a different villa and we‚Äôre finally comfortable.

They said they would fix it the following day, however nobody came - even if someone did come to fix the hole in the bathroom and the door, there still would have been many bugs as there were throughout majority of the villa. I had to sleep in the living room as the first bedroom door would not close (was broken)

Furthermore, this place is SO DIFFICULT TO FIND. None of our drivers were able to find it, impossible for gojek or grab drivers to find to pick you up or deliver food, and is really far out of the main area of Canggu.","It was a wonderful 2 nites stay, newly renovated villa, very clean, room smells good, spacious, living room is comfy too, you can sleep in there!!! Highly recommended!!  Will come back for my next trip! Coconut as welcome drink is üëåüèªüëåüèª"
