Food here are very authentic and good. Never tasted such a sweet coconut water. Very pocket friendly.","Really nice restaurant with friendly staff. Great view over the fishing boats that catch the fish fresh daily.
Allso really cheap","Pondok Waru is a beach-front seafood restaurant in Pebuahan Beach, Jembrana, West Bali. This restaurant is quite attractive as it serves fresh seafood dishes from the local fishermen. The staffs were all friendly and welcoming, they helped me choose what kind of fish which is good to try. So I ordered a fish called ""Kiper Putih"" to be grilled and half of it cooked as a soup. The foods are excellently-cooked, especially the fish which is so fresh, boneless and juicy. I also ordered a fried squid (Cumi Goreng Tepung) and fresh coconut (Es Degan) which are just perfect!
Besides those, they also serve other kind of seafoods (some might be seasonal), such as prawns, lobsters, crabs, and scallops.

For those all I ordered costed me:
1). 240K for 2.4 kilograms of Kiper Putih fish (100K/kg). Different kind of fish may costs differently. Btw I could also freely choose how the fish were gonna be cooked (fried/grilled/soup/curried/steamed as ""Pepes""), it'd cost the same
2). 35K for a plate of fried squid (Cumi Goreng Tepung)
3). 10K for a whole fresh coconut
Those prices, I think, are affordable enough for such a big portion of seafoods ðŸ˜„ðŸ’°

Now, for the cons:
- When I went there, I was actually mesmerised how the restaurant and the beach are much a tourism potential. It is located right on the shore, in the middle of a local fisherman village, which is so traditional yet beautiful. But unfortunately, the access there were badly maintained, and villagers also seem to haven't got much concern from the local government relating to the development of tourism potential and environmental hygiene in the area.
- For the restaurant itself also seems a little unkempt because of some remaining damages from the beach abrasion.

Soo, I'm gonna give it 4/5 because this place gonna need much improvements! But I definitely would like come again whenever I go to Jembrana ðŸ˜Š","Great view, very good seafood & prices.","Location near beach, good vibes, prices also good"
