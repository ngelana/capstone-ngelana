Choose this spot based on photos of the ambiance and the high ratings. The staff were welcoming and friendly.

The food is near the top of any I‚Äôve had during my Bali visit. We ordered the chicken with mushrooms sauce and the aromatic seafood and chicken satay. And for drinks, peach mint iced teas. Which were super freshening and natural, not sweetened.

They played live music which created a great atmosphere.

Would definitely recommend this spot. üëåüèΩ","You walk across the yellow bridge to Ceningan and then stroll along a dirt road behind the restaurants / bars, getting glimpses of the view between the trees.
Sea Breeze is a brilliant spot to rest after a walk.
You could spend hours gazing across the water.
The food is excellent, and the drinks are cheap.
Such a bargain, we thought we'd been undercharged.","Great place with an amazing view, Good price for okay prices.

Even has a little beach a pool on sight.

Borderline big menu though. But it‚Äôs something for everyone here!

Both delicious. We heard sunset is amazing so staying here for dinner too!","Nice restaurant, too many flies. The moment our food was served we got swarmed by flies. It ruined our mood.

The restaurant is a quirky crossover, half restaurant, half beach club with a nice pool area and a pool bar.

The service was somewhat slow, while there were only 6 customers, and we were the only people that had ordered food, we ended up waiting 30 minutes for our food to arrive.

The food was tasty although hard to enjoy due to the large number of flies that arrived with the food.

There is a 11% tax added to your bill and an extra 3% charge if you opt to pay by credit card.

It seems like a nice place."

Sometimes they gave me a plate of fresh fruits for free, they're cleaning the room mostly every second day, make your laundry if you want to, also drove me to the boat for free when I leaved. the accommodation and the rooms are clean and groomed. The outdoor bathroom is a really cool experience. The rooms are large and simply furnished, but you got everything you need, ac and big fan in every room. Bathroom is spartanic but honestly, you will find that at the most low budget rooms in the whole area of this island and the islands around. You get used to it fast and also you can't expect European standards for bathrooms in indonesia. Cost-performance Ratio very Good! Highly recommended!","The room is spacious, good AC, nice staff and very helpful, easy to access this property because near from yellow bridge.",Nice and clean. Close to the beach.  It is still under construction but nicely done.,Lovely family run place. Simple but nice and great location,Good
