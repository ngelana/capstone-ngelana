Nestled in the tranquil setting of Bali, our two-bedroom villa with a private pool and jacuzzi was nothing short of luxurious.

From the moment we arrived, the staff welcomed us with warmth and genuine hospitality, making us feel right at home. Their attentiveness and willingness to assist truly elevated our stay. We were particularly impressed by the impeccable housekeeping service, which was provided twice a day ‚Äì a level of care and attention to detail that we had never experienced before.

The breathtaking view from our villa, especially around the pool area, was simply mesmerizing. It felt like we were perched above the clouds, surrounded by the beauty of Bali's natural landscape.

One of the highlights of our stay was the exceptional dining experience. The breakfast spread offered a plethora of options to suit every palate, and each dish was expertly prepared and delicious. The same can be said for the lunch and dinner menus ‚Äì every meal was a culinary delight.

In summary, Elevate Bali surpassed all our expectations and truly deserves a rating of 7 stars. Our time spent there felt like a slice of paradise, and we cannot wait to return for another unforgettable getaway.","Had the loveliest lunch at Elevate Bali today, and wow, what a treat! The restaurant sits in the most picturesque spot with a view that just takes your breath away.
Walking in, we felt instantly relaxed. The staff were super friendly and made us feel right at home. It was like catching up with old friends.

Now, let's talk about the food - it was absolutely divine! Each dish was like a burst of flavor in my mouth. We went for the pasta and coffee and they did not disappoint.

What made it even better was enjoying all this deliciousness while soaking in the stunning views. It felt like a mini escape from reality.
Overall, Elevate Bali has won me over completely. If you're looking for a spot to enjoy good food and unwind with a view, this is it. Can't wait to come back for more!","Had a very pleasant time here and would definitely come back one day. I must say it was an unforgettable experience. From the breathtaking views to the impeccable service and delicious food, every aspect of my visit exceeded my expectations! Overall, my experience at Elevate Bali was nothing short of extraordinary. I genuinely thank all the staff who went above and beyond to ensure that my every need was met.","The hotel was amazing. Would highly recommend a stay if you want to relax and be in a romantic and secluded place.
The view is amazing, as you are so high up clouds do get in the way in the evenings, but the morning view are spectacular.

Dinner options are okay. Breakfast options are good.

Would recommend eating here at least once during the stay.","We enjoyed our stay at Elevate Bali. The villas offer nice views and the heated swimming pool was a highlight. The food was very good, and the staff was helpful and friendly. It was a memorable experience.

However, there were some downsides. When we extended our stay, the rate remained the same, which was disappointing. Also, at checkout, there was a mistake with our bill where we were double charged. We had to wait 20 minutes for the staff to resolve the issue. Our driver had to wait as well, which was inconvenient. It would have been nice to receive some form of compensation, like a discount or a complimentary drink, for the inconvenience while we were waiting."

It‚Äôs a nice little stop in Munduk area. Very authentic. I think it looks beautiful in every weather condition. When we came it was clouds down and atmosphere was very mistery. Kori made a great job to organize landscape around his house. We had a traditional Balines coffee from him and had a little talk. He is very friendly and kind. I wish all the best for him and would recommend to visit him and say Hi :)
Thanks, Kori and good luck with your project ‚ô•Ô∏è","Wow!!! I came here because of the lovely Google reviews and was not disappointed. The road down is narrow and confusing but keep going and you‚Äôll see the cafe on your right side eventually. I was immediately greeted by Kori and walked into his beautiful garden with the most amazing views (see video). He only had coffee and tea to offer so I got a coffee which he brought out and asked to take a seat with me. We chatted about different things and when I told him about the different fruit I have tried he took me to his sisters garden next door to harvest and eat some fresh fruit (still have like 10 pieces in my bag). Then it started raining and he quickly invited me inside to his living room for another tea. We kept chatting and I spent over an hour at his house waiting for the rain to stop. He gave me all sorts of tips and told me all about Balinese culture while showing me photos. Encounters like these is why you travel other countries. Please go and visit Kori while you‚Äôre in Munduk, you won‚Äôt be disappointed","A true gem that unveils the real essence of Bali ‚ú® You can enjoy the incredible views and the purest air while savoring a delicious coffee. Kory, the host of the place, is an incredibly warm and welcoming person, and also a talented photographer üòä It‚Äôs a definitely must-visit if you're going to Munduk.","The place is really well placed and the owner is as kind as you can see on all the reviews. I‚Äôve enjoyed drinking my tea with Kori (not sure how to spell it üòÖ) and talking with him.
He‚Äôs genuinely really kind and like being visited.
So if you come close by, you can just stop to his place and drink a good tea (or coffee) and have a nice conversation.
He‚Äôs also really good at photography so if you‚Äôre lucky to have a nice weather with a beautiful sunset maybe he can do some magic üòÄ",They serve only tea and basic Balinese coffee but the view is great. You can buy your food and go and eat here with friends. The owner is amazing. Help him by buying the tea and coffee there. Life is hard for him after covid. He will click amazing pictures if you request.
