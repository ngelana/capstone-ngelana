Nestled in the heart of the rainforest, every moment felt like a lavish escape. The staff were beyond fantastic; even with an extremely last-minute booking, they were incredibly accommodating. The food surpassed all expectations, fresh and locally sourced, adding a delightful touch to our stay. Made, our exceptional host, ensured each day was filled with delight. We wished we could have extended our stay beyond three nights. Surrounded by nature, with nothing but farmland and forests, plus our own private waterfall, it was truly paradise. Thank you, Gala Lima Glamping, for a truly unforgettable experience. We'll definitely be back!","Nestled in the heart of Bali's lush jungle, this glamping haven is a true gem.
Surrounded by palm trees, a private waterfall, and the soothing sounds of the river, it offers an unparalleled escape into nature.

The tranquility of the area, combined with the luxury amenities, creates a perfect balance. The well maintained swimming pool adds a touch of opulence, while the attentive staff provides exceptional service, ensuring a seamless and relaxing stay.

If you seek a secluded paradise with the comforts of a high end retreat, this glamping spot is a must visit. A haven for peace seekers and nature lovers alike.

Thank you Mr.Made and staff ðŸ¤©","Amazing place, a little paradise with its own waterfall. Only 4 comfortable glamping tents, very quiet stay. Don't be afraid of stairs.","We had a delightful experience at Galalima. Although it was a bit farther than I expected, it was completely worth it. The manager, Pa Made, was incredibly friendly and accommodating. He made my request for a breakfast in front of the waterfall come true, and I truly appreciate his efforts. Thank you for a wonderful time!","modern glamping site in Selamadeg Bali.  There are 4 units of glamping spots that are arranged down to the pivate waterfall.
The entrance to this location is rather small so it must be done before sunset.
Upon entering you are greeted by 4 friendly and helpful employees: Ibu Nyoman, Nina, Ryan and Dedi.
Communication using HT.
There is a welcome drink ""kombucha tea"" with fried banana snacks and tempe goreng so delicious.
Wi-Fi OK
Everything is nice"
