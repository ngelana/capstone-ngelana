The staff was incredibly friendly and provided excellent service throughout my stay. They were knowledgeable and always willing to assist with any inquiries or requests.

The food at the eco village was absolutely delicious. I had the opportunity to try a variety of dishes, and each one exceeded my expectations. The ingredients used were fresh and locally sourced, adding to the overall eco-friendly experience.

One of the highlights of my stay was the stunning views. The eco village is surrounded by beautiful landscapes, offering a tranquil and serene atmosphere. Whether it was waking up to a breathtaking sunrise or relaxing in the afternoon while taking in the picturesque scenery, the views provided a sense of peace and tranquility.

The sauna facilities at the eco village were top-notch. The sauna was well-maintained and provided a rejuvenating experience. It was the perfect way to relax and unwind after a day of exploring the surrounding areas.

Additionally, I appreciated that the eco village is dog-friendly. It was a pleasure to be able to bring my furry friend along for the trip. The staff was accommodating and provided amenities and spaces specifically designed for dogs.

Overall, my stay at Bali Eco Village was nothing short of amazing. The pleasant staff, delicious food, stunning views, excellent sauna, and dog-friendly environment all contributed to a memorable experience. I highly recommend this eco village for anyone looking for a sustainable and enjoyable stay in Bali","The view from our balcony is stunning! Sauna and fireplace in the bungalow are something you can't find anywhere else, the surroundings are very serene and tranquil. Mbok Surya and the boys are very accomodating and helpful eventho we asked their help in the middle of the night. The road might be challenging but the boys are always there to help. Overall, the rate and the service are woth the money. Definitely will be back!","Beautiful stay with amazing atmosphere and very friendly staff!
The road on the go to the lodge is a bit hard to travel on. There is also a sauna as an option. The view out of the lodges are breath-taking!
All these on quite good prices!","Nice place to stay but their  location is not for everyone.
I recommend this place for meditation, yoga or  looking for inspiration.","The place is amazing. However, they make the most out of the fact that it is isolated by overpricing activities and properly ripping you off if you don't have your own mean of transportation. Would this policy change rating would go up to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐."
