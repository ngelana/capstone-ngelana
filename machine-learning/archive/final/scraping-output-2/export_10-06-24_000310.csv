Ibu gave us very delicious banana that they harvested from their garden. Bapak told us story about village and balinese story. They treated us like family.

Sure that I'm gonna be back someday.","We stayed for one night in this beautifully decorated, local Balinese home in Tabanan, Bali. This family-run homestay has a genuine and authentic atmosphere, and it's located in a quiet village surrounded by rice fields. It's off the beaten track and therefore not overcrowded with tourists, which is exactly what we were looking for.

The owner, Adi, is a genuinely great guy. He's friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about Bali. He was also our private driver and guide for our full stay of 10 days in different places around Bali. Adi is the best driver and guide we've ever had. He's always on time, he's very reliable, and he's always willing to go the extra mile. He also organized the boat to Nusa Penida for us, with a friend on Nusa Penida to be our driver and guide there.

Adi's homestay is the perfect place to stay if you're looking for an authentic Balinese experience. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the food is delicious. Adi and his family are always happy to help you with anything you need, and they're always willing to share their knowledge of Balinese culture with you.

We highly recommend Adi's homestay to anyone looking for a unique and memorable experience in Bali and we suggest to ask Adi to be your driver for transfers and day trips, so you don't have to worry about the chaotic traffic (and your safety) or finding your destination through the maze of tiny streets.",,,
