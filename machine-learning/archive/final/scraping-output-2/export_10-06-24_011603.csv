The staff handled it well and the manager was very apologetic. The rooms were good and the pool was great. The staff really make this stay great ‚òÄÔ∏è,"Beautiful from the outside but dirty and old inside.
On a new sheets there was a blood spot.. so, I have doubts that it was new.
There are 3 rooms in our villa, two of them downstairs are not prepared, no sheets, smell with mould, there are no remotes for the A/C
I‚Äôm so disappointed for this price","The AC in room 23 doesn‚Äôt work.. I‚Äôd rather sleep outside at this point..

Update:
The staff work hard to accommodate for the shortcomings, and at the end of the day I fully respect that, but a lot of the rooms looks like they need work IE, no ac in room 23..","Room was disgusting, asked for refund I‚Äôm home now in Australia and still waiting for refund?? Photos attached I have no words. Location was good, manager was rude but the Balinese worker at front desk he was lovely","Our villa was exceptional, wood floor , exterior pool , bathroom in each rooms , two floors , kitchen . Bedroom are nice , cost , with proper aircon size . Everything was clean. There was also a big terrace with chairs and table. Located near impossible beach ."

The service was great, staff are happy to help organise transport for a reasonable price, and we‚Äôre helpful with all questions asked.
The hotel is a bit out of the main town but we found it easy to get around by scooter. There is a bit of construction going on in the area so a bit of noise at times, but otherwise quiet and peaceful.
We stayed in one of the top floor rooms. The rooms are cute and bed was super comfy. Bathroom was okay and overall room was what you would expect for the price. Would happily stay again :)","The room was clean and comfortable with a good balcony, the pool is great and clean, reception is helpful and offers a variety of beverages on a fair price. Ac works perfectly, noise isolation is pretty great, shower working very well.
The location is reasonably good (if you walk around 30min you can get near the Main Street and all restaurants and shops), close to a few restaurants, yoga places and shops. For now there are many constructions around. The hotel does rent scooters, but they‚Äôre not always available and are more expensive than the regular rental places (at the hotel the day costed 200.000 and at the rental place 125.000).
Overall is a very good place to stay and I‚Äôll definitely come back.","Great location however there is heavy building work on two sides, often going all through the night, noise is insane.","The hotel's got an okay location to nearby shops/stores and decent restaurants. It is also relatively close to the beach.
Around the hotel in the area is only worksites and workers - which feels a bit ""off"".

The service from the Manager is good.

The room is cozy. Feels like a bungalow even though we're 6 meters up. But the room does not have a waste bin and the bathroom is not super clean.",Good location. Hot shower. AC. Wifi sometimes good. Pool was clean. Smell a little bit humid but I guess everywhere next to the beach will be the same.

Aven welcomed us when we arrived and gave us a fresh coconut. Our first impression was that he was very friendly and helpful. They made our stay in the villa very comfortable and made us feel welcome. Ipank and Aven will help you straight away when you need something or have any questions. Their hospitality attitude is on point! The bedroom and bathroom were big, clean and very beautiful. Outside area with the kitchen, living room, garden with swimmingpool were fantastic! The TV is a smartTV where you can watch Netflix, AmazonPrime, Disney, YouTube etc. The location is also good and close by restaurants and the nearest beach is Dreamland which is like 5 minutes by motorcycle. You can rent a motorcycle with the hosts. Restaurants are also close from the villa.

Everything was perfect and I want to thank Ipank and Aven again for being best hosts!!!!",Beautiful time here last year. Excellent hosts and lovely rooms. Also in a great location. Many places to eat and shop less than 8 minutes away. Definitely recommend:),"We have been coming to Indonesia for many years now and staying at Molokai Suites would have to have been one of our most enjoyable experiences to date. Placed perfectly between Dreamland and Uluwatu beaches and right next to Bingin beach, we had the convenience of many different surf breaks each day. Ipang was an incredibly generous and welcoming host, a true gentleman! 10/10 experience.","Very beautiful villa, has everything you need. The host was overly helpful and very accommodating - thanks again :)
Close enough to several beaches and many good restaurants in the area.
Clean, spacious and friendly. Excellent place to call home üëç",Pool Villa for a decent price with everything you need. Really pretty. Only downside: there is a construction work going on in the whole neighborhood. It‚Äôs super loud already in the early morning - must know before you book there right now! They didn‚Äôt let us know

I have all I wanted in one villa, a complete package.
Staying at Water Edge Villa by Soscomma, you'll have very spacious and beautiful room with comfortable bed.
The bathroom is as spacious as well. There 2 shower, indoor and outdoor, completed with amenities and hairdryer. There's also a bathtub that you can enjoy.
As addition (yet this is the best part of it) the room has private pool and gazebo with incredibly beautiful golf course view. You can enjoy it as much as you want it. The gazebo even has 2 bed for you to relax and enjoy the view.
They also have the best service. All staffs are friendly and always ready to help us.
They just need to increase the cleanliness of the private pool which little bit dirty.
Overall, the serenity, the beauty, and the service of this villa are amazed me!","Luxury villa at a good price! Room is spacious, have a huge bed, nice outdoor lounge pool with a view of the golf course, very quiet place, amazing bathroom. I'm giving it 4 stars since there's no hot water in the shower or bath. Overall, I will definitely come and stay here again. Also, it's quite far from shops and restaurants, would be better if you have a car or motorbike.","* Be warned * It looks nice in the pictures but is dirty and the staff are shifty. More like Beirut than Bali . They insisted on keeping my partners driver's licence at time of booking in, after seeing the room
and the disgrace that it was we told them we were not staying. They would not give us our money back, said they didn't know how, and they had to send someone away on a scooter to pick up the licence from goodness knows where - so dodgey. Disappointed to say the least, was the most expensive place so we were looking forward to something special. Our villa with private pool was dirty and there was someone in the bushes behind our pool, possibly fishing, not sure what they were doing. Food preparation area was dirty with flies everywhere. Other disgruntled guests were also leaving when we were trying to leave. We have been back in Oz for 4 days now and they've just taken more money from our Visa card!","Beautiful property .. right in middle of the new kuta golf course .
Villas are spacious and peaceful","Far from shops & services, recommend renting a scooter. Otherwise very nice, quiet, private."
