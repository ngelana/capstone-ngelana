The room is just beautiful and so cosy. The highlight was definitely the view... Incredible! Even if the river is close to the room, the noise wasn't stressful at all. The location of the accommodation is also very practical as you can go to Aling Aling by foot and good restaurants are also nearby (Monks Kitchen, Top vibes, few Wahrungs, ...). The staff and the owner were lovely people and always there to help. Really don't hesitate, you will not be disappointed.
Thank you for everything üôè","We were at Aling Aling waterfall where we meet the owner of this place. As it was pouring rain, the owner took us in and spent a night at the accommodation. We had the best time of our entire 1 month Bali experience. The owner and his wife are absolutely amazing people, so friendly and kind. They showed us around the town and also went out to eat dinner together. If you want to have a meaningful and soul worming Balinese experience, I recommend this place. As a bonus, the wife is a yoga practitioner, so you can do yoga while admiring the rice fields. Will definitely return when we will be visiting Bali as this place is way better then the other touristic places like Ubud or south Bali.","We stayed 2 days here after a visit on Aling Aling Waterfall which is so close that you will think is in the back yard of this acomodation.
The room is very nice, it has a romantic vibe, they can serve you the breakfast directly on the patio so you can enjoy the view at the river and rice fields while you eat and drink your coffe/tea.
The hosts(a young couple) are very nice and they're promoting the north area.
If you want your stay in Bali to be at Starbucks every day , stay in Ubud, but if you want to explore and have a real experince go to the north. Here you can slide into a waterfall, jump from 5/10/15 meters into a waterfall, swing on a rope and dive in waterfall, see dolphins, swim with them, do snorkeling and feed the fish right from your hand.
I'm sure that the host can arange all these experiences and many more for you. He also did it for us.
Basically we came here as tourists and leave as a friends.
For us, these 2 days were the best in Bali.","If you need place to self healing with room surrounded by nature dan river view, then you should book the beautiful Damuh Pertivi. No regrets at all. Enjoy.","Bali has always been close to my heart not just coz of the place but coz of the PEOPLE, the love, and the care they shower in their hospitality. And PERTIVI LOVE is one live and prominent example of the same. The stream flowing behind your cottage, the mesmerising sound of the same in the lap of true nature is just something to experience and feel, rather difficult to explain in words.
Ajna, Gede and the whole team are wonderful souls to make your stay so pleasant and always eager and supportive to assist you to experience the beautiful north of Bali. Their aura is such that you will never feel that you are meeting them for the first time. Thanks for the lovely experienceüòå‚ù§Ô∏è"

Beautiful panoramic rice paddies view, amazing service, much of the food comes from the garden! 5* quality stay for anyone wanting to see 'authentic Bali'
A truly unique gem in the heart of North Bali.","Looking out to the horizon from the romantic ancient joglo we  are mesmorised buy a sea of sparkling lights.

When we awake after a blissful sleep in the comfortable 4 poster bed our view has changed  to  rice terraces and a picture perfect Ocean vista which reaches the sky.

This incredible panorama  can also be soaked up from the infinity pool and outdoor lounge area.

Our joglo was self contained with every detail taken care of for a perfect holiday stay which included a kitchen and dining area.

Our family felt like Royalty, we highly recommend staying at this Balinese heavenly retreat at Kedu Indah Stay.","Even though you are in the hills above Lovina with magnificent views to the ocean, you feel like you are in a resort, but with no other guests! The ocean breezes are soothing, the pool is divine and it is easy to fall asleep at the poolside or on the verandah.  Beautifully and colourfully furnished, with a full kitchen, Kedu Indah Stay is a fabulous place to get away from the hustle and bustle of life. Mary is the best hostess, thank you for my stay.  I loved it x","Had the most amazing experience here and can't wait to go back!  From the moment you walk into your jogalow you feel calm and welcomed.

The furnishings are divine and I highly recommend having a nap on the daybed on the spacious verandah.  The view is spectacular, looking over rice fields and out to the ocean.  The accomodation has everything you need - kitchen, bottled water, stunning bathroom, very comfortable beds and linen and the pool is absolutely breathtaking! You won't want to move far away from it!  With shaded areas to retreat to, to have a cool drink, read a book, relax and take in the view you will feel the serene beauty of the place.
Perfect getaway for you to meditate, take some space for yourself and completely unwind.  The host Mary is wonderful and nothing is a problem for her.
Its a short trip to the beach to see the dolphins or eat at one of the great restaurants in Lovinia.  This is a truly relaxing Balinese experience which will fill your cup and leave you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.
Highly recommend a stay here.","I have just finished a blissful 2 weeks at Kedu Indah Stay & feel totally rejuvenated!! The accomodation is 5 star & the host Ketut & his staff looked after me as if I was family.  They whipped up some yummy food when desired.If you want a taste of paradise, this is it! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Warren is a great host and everything else also was perfect. A clean bungalow with 'jungle view', nice breakfast and such a beautiful pool. We felt very welcome and enjoyed our chats with Warren and Nurul. We felt part of their family yet they also gave us the chance to enjoy this great place in our own üòä. The jungle trip was the cherry on the cake!! If you want to have an unforgettable experience in rural Bali away from the tourists, than this is the place to go!","A destination for anyone who is willing and able to get away from the beaten path of the usual tourist experience.
This is a really friendly family. This also means that your stay there will be comfortable and very flexible (I arrived really late but still was invited for tea and had a long chat with the very friendly owner who helped me with a variety of things and answered my questions / gave advice).
The surroundings are amazing. The waterfall nearby is something to behold. More than enough for a single day to if you like waterfalls like me make sure to schedule two - just to admire it and splash around.
Make sure you have a scooter to freely more around. (This pretty much goes for all of Bali).
I highly recommend this place.","I was travelling alone and met warren and his wife at a small supermarket there. We had a great talk there and he invited me to his villa/homestay the next day. He and his family were super friendly and I felt home like one second after I arrived. My room was super nice and i had the best mattress there (the best i ever had in Bali!)
Warren can tell u a lot about Bali and the wildlife there and he is a jungle-expert. We made a fantastic trip there with the scooter over some tracks just he and the locals know. Best day I ever had there! So if you want to get in contact with locals and make a adventure you will never forget, book this homestay. :)
Greets to Warren and his family.

Best regards,

Leo :)",We recently stayed with Warren & his family & found them to be warm & friendly. They were very helpful & generous & made us feel welcome. The accomodation was clean & neat & the setting was fantastic. We would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the real natural setting of Bali together with a genuine host family. It was truely a memorable experience.,"I would HIGHLY recommend a stay at Pondok Manis! I was in Indonesia for a 2 a week trip with friends and had the homestay recommended to by my Dad before I left. I went alone to get away from the hustle and bustle of Bali to see something positively different. As soon as I arrived I was blown away by how fluent Warren could speak to my driver, it showed that he knew exactly what he was doing and that he truely cared about the country and culture. I stayed there for 2 nights and i wish i could've stayed longer. He took me into the nearby jungles and local village where Warren and his sons showed me a completely fresh side of Indonesia that many tourists miss. He introduced me to the locals and gave me a taste of the true Indonesian experience. His wife, Narul is an incredible cook and so nice, I had my own room to stay in seperate from the main house and slept like a baby next to the rushing river. He had extensive knowledge of the local plants and people themselves and he made the experience one to remember. I felt incredibly welcome!! I will be going back as soon as I can and staying even longer.
See you soon Warren!"
