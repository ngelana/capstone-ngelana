My boyfriend had the sesame chicken which was also very good!,"We walked 1 hr and 30 minutes to try the famous acai bowls. We were craving something refreshing/cold! The bowls were beautiful and flavorful but they felt room temperature. We sat in the gelato place to enjoy the air condition but there was a garbage smell coming from the streets. Some flies wondering here and there. They offered us ice water which was nice of them but beware it‚Äôs not bottled mineral water, they use a terra filter. If you have a strong stomach you should be totally fine drinking out of this filter, otherwise buy some bottles.  Toppings on the bowls were amazing and they accommodate food allergies .",Bowls are really pretty and delicious. Unfortunately they only sell one size which is way too much. And it wasn‚Äôt just us - all the tables around us also couldn‚Äôt finish their bowls. To avoid wasting food it would be nice if a smaller size would be offered too. Pancakes were tasty too.,"I was sceptical if the bowls are worth the hype and I have to admit that they are actually pretty dope. I got the black berry bowl and my bf the coca. Both were really good and to our surprise very filling. We couldn‚Äôt finish them and took the rest for take away!
I also got a cappuccino with oat milk and it was really good! Especially the mug is too cute.
If you are looking for a fun experience and good smoothie bowls, I can highly suggest!","A cute cafe and bistro next to the monlry forest, but in a calm area! The staff were so friendly and nice. I ordered gnocchi, they were okay but the smoothie and juice were very good and refreshing! Recommended for a quick stop for a drink or a qui k bite!"

The location was also excellent, right near the monkey forest and nice restaurants.

It was my partner's birthday, so I booked the room as a surprise, and I had organised for the bed to be decorated and a floating breakfast.
The hotel didn't pass on the message, and they messed up both gestures. they tried their best to accommodate me after I expressed my disappointment.
They didn't charge me for the decorated bed or floating basket, but it left me feeling frustrated because it was difficult to communicate with the staff when i had to ask a third time for the floating basket, and they ruined the surprise in front of my partner.

Overall, it was a beautiful spot, but disappointing service.","We stayed in their Grand Forest Suite for 2 nights for our wedding anniversary in May.

Service is excellent,  communication via Whatsapp prior to our stay was responsive and good.

We asked for halal food during our stay and the resort acceded to our request. Much appreciated for this.

Room and bathroom are very clean, beds and pillows are very plush and comfortable.

The resort was kind in serving a complimentary anniversary cake to us in our room. Thank you for making our stay very pleasant and memorable.","A quiet respite within the vibrant Ubud village. Our room along with private pool, alfresco and hammock had complete privacy overlooking rice fields. Yet we were a short walk to all Ubud has to offer.
The staff were all so kind, welcoming and accommodating.
11/10 - would definitely go again.",This was our first time to Ubud. and this resort was quite nice. The staff was very friendly and did their best to accommodate us with almost capacity amount of guests. It is very conveniently located to several activities. The views of the pool/breakfast are very nice. The only drawback to mention is the monkeys- We were eating a late lunch on our patio and about halfway through our meal several monkeys came and finished the rest of our meal as we quickly fleeted. The staff did their best to woo them away but it did not work. I was expecting the meal to be free of charge since we did not get to complete the meal. but we ended up paying for it. Some people enjoy the monkeys. due to their aggressiveness we did not enjoy them.,"Kaamala Resort is right in the middle of Ubud, close to cool restaurants, cafes and bars and it‚Äôs awesome. The people working there are super friendly and the whole place feels top-notch. Room design is superb with private pool. They‚Äôve got this cool infinity pool that looks out over the forest, which is pretty special. Breakfast is great too‚Äîlots of healthy, tasty options. Plus, the Monkey Forest is super close, so you might even see some monkeys hanging out in your garden. It‚Äôs a really nice spot if you‚Äôre staying in Ubud."

Firstly we were already extremely grateful that prior to our arrival, we were upgraded to the Royal Pool Villa (their highest villa category) from the pool terrace room with no extra charge involved.

All the staf from Arkamara certainly made our stay extra special, starting from Vini and Sesil at the reception who received us so well and made us feel so welcome, Yanti who served us very well at the hotel restaurant, taum and his rooftop bar staff were great, and Gung De Ta who served as both front desk and our driver to the airport, Gung De Ta certainly went out of his way to provide us with very good tips on food and places to visit in around Ubud and Bali. He even brought us to a very good place for last minute souvenir shopping on the way to the airport, what a great guy.

The food at Arkamara was also really good, with its amazing breakfast spread and variety which we were privileged to enjoy at our Royal Pool Villa upon request, with an amazing spread and selections to choose from.

All in all our stay was certainly one to remember and treasure, with the wonderful staff on hand adding to an unforgettable experience in Bali.

The staff were friendly and accommodating, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the location was perfect for exploring the city. The common areas were cozy and inviting, offering a great place to socialize with other guests. I also appreciated the variety of activities and tours offered by the hostel, making it easy to fill my days with fun adventures. Overall, I would highly recommend this hostel to anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay while exploring Ubud.","A bit pricier than other hostels in the area but worth it for sure. I was in a 4 bed female dorm. Very roomy 1.5 size bed with a locker, good aircon, clean. Shared areas were tidy, well set up. beakfast included. Bar and food available. They also offered lots of group activities ( cooking class, group dinners, yoga, movie night) that were free or for a small fee.

I did also leave an item of clothing. Admin staff (Nata) was very responsive on emails and I was easily able to arrange for someone to pick it up.

Thank you!","Top tier in all marks - easily worth the money.
First and foremost the hostel looks amazing (the bathroom, dorms, common area and reception)
Secondly, the staff is incredibly welcoming, considerate and helpful.
Thirdly, they offer daily social activities, many free (yoga, massage, breakfast and more) as well as many great tours (Mt.Batur and one around Ubud)! There are also many tours offered, as well as scooter rental and laundry just outside the gate to a fair price (e.g. jewelry) If you wanna try something else

The room we slept in was a 8-man dorm. The beds are 120cm wide and comfortable. Overall a nice aesthetic vibe.

Shared bathrooms were nice as well and cleaned daily.

Also a good social vibe which was the reason we stayed 4nights instead of the intended 1.",This hostel is beautiful! Lovely staff and clean facilities.

A little run down in parts . Room 121 loose tap.
From the dining area you can see bits of wood facial missing from covers too upper balconies.
Main pool ladders missing teams and loose bolts.

Close walk on the shortcut through the monkey forest and then you're in Ubud. Friendly local people in the streets. The staff is nice as you would expect and the pools are good. They have a nice rooftop deck where you can chill. Breakfast is good, with a wide variety of warm dishes and you can get freshly made omelette every morning. They offered to put the beds together.

Only 1 small remark about the tap and shower in our room.

As I stepped into the restaurant, I was immediately captivated by the serene ambiance created by lush greenery. The gentle rustling of leaves added to the soothing atmosphere, making it the perfect setting for a memorable evening.

One cannot speak of Laka Leke Restaurant without mentioning their signature dish: crispy bebek. As I took my first bite, I was greeted by a symphony of flavors and textures that danced on my palate. The succulent duck, perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, was complemented by a tantalizing blend of spices that elevated the dish to new heights. Each bite was a journey of culinary delight, leaving me craving for more.

But it wasn't just the food that left a lasting impression; it was the impeccable service and attention to detail that truly set Laka Leke Restaurant apart. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warm smiles and attentive hospitality, making me feel like a valued guest every step of the way.

Laka Leke Restaurant is more than just a place to dine; it's a destination for those who seek not only great food but also an unforgettable experience.","This is a true tourist place, and if it's your 1st time here & in Bali, everything will be awesome. The food is not too bad, but there's a lot of room for improvement. The ambience is nice, though, and the restaurant area is huge.

This place used to be packed worth tour buses, but since the pandemic, things have changed. For me, it's a 'One-Time-Only' experience. Ordered the rice set for 2 persons, and there were a few repeat dishes in the platter. Price was almost 500k, including the surprising 21% service charge! Watch our for that.

Location is also not in the main town area, so you need to take a taxi or GoJek there.",Really nice dinner. Wonderful flavours and very polite staff. I'm sure the ambiance would be 10x better in the day so you can really appreciate the garden etc.,"Coming in as part of organized luncheon.
This one of the place to go if you are coming in groups.

The area is very leafy and quite perfect for a resting moment after day discovering Ubud.

Good crispy duck is a must try.","The Crispy Fried Bebek and the Grilled Snapper at Laka Leke was one of the highlights in my recent Bali trip. The duck was fried to a nice golden crisp on the outside and succulent and fragrant on the inside. The snapper was fresh and grilled to a nice texture, and served with a gravy that was both appetising and flavourful. The staff were also very polite and friendly. We had a wonderful evening enjoying our dinner with the golden hue of the sunset over the peaceful padi fields in the background. It was worth the journey from our hotel to the restaurant."

The room was clean and wonderful, just like in the photos. We enjoyed relaxing with our family in the outdoor bathtub and pool. The staff were friendly and always greeted us with a smile. They even offered us water while waiting for a taxi in the lobby, showing their attention to our comfort.
Especially Aris, who drove us for transfers and tours, not only drove safely but also gave us advice on sightseeing, for which we are grateful.

We had a one-and-a-half-year-old daughter, and they took care of everything from arranging a child seat to meals. They prepared special breakfast items like porridge, steamed vegetables, and chicken for her, and she ate to her heart's content. Many large hotels often charge for such services, but they kindly provided them for free.
The room service offered delicious meals at reasonable prices, making it possible for families with children to relax and enjoy their time within the hotel.

The property is impeccably clean, and the rooms are spacious, each featuring a private plunge pool. The hospitality of all staff members was outstanding; they were helpful, friendly, and always ready to assist us.

The hotel's location is super convenient,  about a 20-minute walk from Ubud city centre and a 1.5-hour drive from DPS airport.

Upon arrival at the airport, we hired a driver provided by the hotel. His name is Ariasa. He is an excellent driver with extensive knowledge of the best local spots and restaurants. We were so impressed with his service that we specifically requested him to be our driver for the entire trip!

We highly recommend requesting Ariasa if you need to travel by car","Simply the best. I don‚Äôt write reviews often, but my wife and I were blown away by the friendly and kind-hearted service, beautiful facility, easy access to Ubud, and high-quality restaurant at Tejaprana Bisma.

From the moment of our arrival, the entire staff went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. They took care of our room throughout the day, organized transportation to fancy dinners and our next destination, and went above and beyond to accommodate our vegan diets. The restaurant is great, and the rest of the facilities (spa, lounge, private pool) are in excellent shape. The hotel‚Äôs location is also great for exploring Ubud while still feeling like your home is a private jungle oasis.

But above all was how we were treated by everyone we encountered. Ika, Diha, Made, Ari, Aris, and the rest of the team were so friendly and thoughtful throughout. We were genuinely sad to say farewell to this great group of folks, and I will spread the word about their business as much as I can. If you have the opportunity to stay here, please do!","During our recent stay at Tejaprana Bisma in Ubud, Bali, my wife and I were anticipating a level of exclusive privacy typical of a villa experience. However, upon checking in, we encountered an unsettling incident. While my wife was changing and I was showering in an area exposed to the garden, a staff member unexpectedly appeared, catching us in a vulnerable state.

We promptly informed the hotel management of our disappointment, yet found the response lacking. Despite receiving an accident report, we felt no resolution offered to us. The General Manager's response, characterized by a few apologies, lacked any meaningful attempt at recovery. Moreover, her request for proof of our situation left us feeling accused and further upset.

Interestingly, the manager's apologies seemed more genuine in comparison. While the hotel offered us a complimentary spa treatment, we remain uncertain if this gesture was in response to the incident or standard for all guests.

Ultimately, we received no refund or meaningful compensation for the distressing experience

Update : they offer a waiver of Expense when we check out","An Exquisite Escape at Tejaprana Bisma

From the moment you step into Tejaprana Bisma, you're enveloped in an atmosphere of unparalleled excellence. The service is impeccable, setting a high standard for hospitality. Each room is a testament to meticulous organization, ensuring guests want for nothing during their stay.

The accommodations are spacious, boasting pristine cleanliness that shines through. The private pool is a sanctuary of tranquility, while the outdoor sitting area offers a serene spot to unwind. The hotel restaurant serves up delectable dishes, with prices that are more than fair for the esteemed location.

The staff at Tejaprana Bisma are the heart of the resort, always wearing a smile and eager to assist, enhancing the stay with their genuine care. The infinity pool is consistently spotless, reflecting the establishment's commitment to excellence.

In summary, Tejaprana Bisma is a jewel in Bali's crown, delivering an experience that is nothing short of superlative."

Stoked to be here! ü§ôüèº","What a beautiful oasis! With the infinity pool and cabanas it‚Äôs so relaxing. We had a hen do lunch here and they were fantastic, very warm and welcoming with us. The food was great and so was the service. The frozen strawberry daiquiri was so good! A must go place! Thank you so much for looking after us."

Food was outstanding and wonderful mix of Mediterranean flavors. Unusual and tasty herbal based cocktail menu. Everything we ordered was phenomenal.,"The atmosphere of the restaurant and service were fantastic. However several of the dishes we tried were lacking salt/flavor. For the price point being high, we expected the food to be better. The duck and the truffle mashed were very good but the octopus was tough and the red snapper carpaccio lacked flavor.
Also, I know this isn‚Äôt the restaurant‚Äôs fault but it would be nice if they didn‚Äôt allow guests to talk on speaker phone or listen to videos loud at their table. It takes away from the nice atmosphere they are providing.","The food was good, we had a great time and the staff were amazing. Appreciate the intimate atmosphere and size of the place. Try the prawns and the octopus. They are a must!","For more information and photos check out my Instagram @blondevoyageabroad

A great restaurant with very quality food. It is a quieter place for a nice relaxed dinner. I loved their wild rice, eggs Benedict for breakfast choice, and their vegetable sides."

it was such as a wonderful day staying at Coliving Outpost.
Outpost restaurant food was the highlight of the evening. Each dish was a culinary masterpiece. The flavors were exquisite, and the presentation was artful.

Can't wait to come back!,"In Indonesia, everyone is very polite and kind, but Outpost Ubud has the nicest, most hardworking, successful reception you could possibly find. It is definitely worth the price charged. The environment and atmosphere are beautiful","I came not to stay, but to meet my friend who was staying. The rooms looked quite nice and clean.

AC wasn‚Äôt working to full blast when we checked in but they sorted it right away and put in an extra unit to the room so it was nice and cool when we got back from our afternoon out.

It's a perfect location nestled in a quiet area close to the bustling Ubud tourist centre and near some really lovely off-the-beaten-track restaurants and cafe's. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. The only thing I'd suggest is they update the bathrooms as the shower was a bit tricky to manoever if you are over 4 foot tall, and they were hard to keep clean. A fresh tile make-over would be awesome.","I just stayed at this wonderful, peaceful place!
Ary, Wayan and staff are super helpful and supportive!
Beautiful views of rice paddies with with big, open spaces throughout!
Near many restaurants and beautiful walking area!
Nature at its best, and super quiet from any traffic day and night, even close to the monkey Forest.
Rooms are thoroughly cleaned everyday.
I loved it, and I will go back there for sure!
I love the pool, the breakfast, the room and the Energy was excellent.
I highly recommend Saren Indah Hotel...the meaning is The Beautiful One!

The rooms were really nice and the hotel is right next to lots of nice restaurants and shops. The free breakfast was super tasty and they also rent scooters for a reasonably price as well. Would recommend to anyone coming to Ubud to definitively stay here.","Lovely and memorable stay during our trip to Bali in April, 2023. It‚Äôs located near to the sacred monkey forest. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The swimming pool is cozy and nice which my son enjoyed to the core.

Didn‚Äôt try the menu but it got the right elements
Coffee , pastry , soft serve ice cream and pizza.
Great little place.","The place is just beneath the Monkey Forest.  If you are coming from the ubud center, you can use the shortcut that passes through the Monkey Forest.

Upon arrival we were surprised with a delicious cake for my partner‚Äôs birthday! The staff's warmth and courtesy made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived. Breakfast was a highlight, offering plenty of options including fresh juices and expertly crafted lattes with oat and regular milk. The hotel's restaurant Embers, with its innovative concept and use of organic vegetables from the garden, served some of the most amazing food we've ever tasted. We thoroughly enjoyed the daily yoga classes led by Dessai, tailored perfectly to accommodate both my beginner partner and my intermediate level. The Mandala Spa experience was equally impressive, with natural oils and a beautiful massage room. Our villa was meticulously cleaned twice a day, and the spacious pool surrounded by lush foliage provided the perfect setting for the ‚Äújungle vibes‚Äù. The comfortable bed ensured restful nights, aided by the hotel's serene location near the Monkey Forest. We followed the staff's advice regarding monkeys and didn‚Äôt leave anything that could attract them into our villa. Every detail, from the thoughtful touches to the friendly staff, contributed to making this the best hotel experience we've ever had. A huge shout out to the drivers available at the hotel, they took us everywhere we wanted to go and to and from the airport - really recommend it! We're already looking forward to returning!","Beautiful villas in the heart of ubud.great service and most warm and welcoming staff. I highly recommend this property. Fabulous location amazing food!
As much as the villas were gorgeous , a special mention to their kindness and understanding, we had to cut short our trip suddenly due to a death in the family and the staff  and management were outstanding not only did they help us get organized in the middle of the night to leave early morning but also compensated us for unused nights! I am truly impressed with their level of service! Looking forward to being back there !","Super convenient location. Only 1 minute from Monkey Forest but feels like it's completely remote due to the incredible silence and peace that you can breath in the Villa.

The minimalistic design and charming vibes provides such a relaxed and luxurious experience. We cannot recommend enough!","It is a perfect combination of a hotel and a villa staying. We booked a double room villa for our family and it was more than perfect. Staff is kind, food is excellent and the villa itself‚Ä¶ amazing. That kind of luxury what you always want in your life.","When booking the villa, it was not indicated anywhere on the booking that they were away from the hotel ( almost 500 meters ) . This means that although the hotel's infrastructure is accessible , it is decent to walk to it .  The villa itself was very clean, the pool was really big. Inside the villa, the interior is significantly modern and we liked it. But there are very significant disadvantages. The villas are very close to each other and we literally heard our neighbor coughing every time at night. Also, the hotel stands close behind a fence, next to which there is a road, so you will listen to the sound of passing mopeds 24 hours a day."

Well they did but it was hidden under the lettuce. It was soooooo small. The red wine poor was just awful. The beer was cold. This place is just not worth it. There are so many great restaurants in Ubud don‚Äôt be cheap! For $1 more you can have amazing more.,"Discovered by chance. I ordered a Mee goreng vegetables and ice ginger tea. Noodles taste pretty standard and a bit salty to my taste. The ginger tea was my favorite. The ginger juice was served separately and came with half a lime. It was so good and spicy. I love it. One of the cheapest meals I had in Ubud.

Mee goreng 25k
Ice ginger tea 15k.","Reasonably priced food and nice staff ^_^

I would recommend trying the Red Dragon roll","Must try their ""Paket Ikan Bakar"" with the price they offer, it's totally worth it. Served with freshly steamed rice, salad, sambal matah, a big chunk of delicious fish, saut√© vegetables, and extra fish soup for its completion. So fulfilling, really introduce a good Balinese food for everyone.

Unfortunately their waitress was a bit too loud and didn't serve us immediately. The music in the background was sickening as it is played over and over again.","Really tasty food. I recommend the tuna steak with potato puree and water spinach. Such a good dish. The sushi is also good, we had a few different plates, all good.
It gets quite busy, but we didn't have to make a reservation. I recommend this place, irs really good value for money."

It is not clean at all, toilet seems have not been cleaned for months. Specially the walls, bath tubes. Sink and the toilet. And towels.
The shower in our room was damaged at first. (It should not be from the beginning). I have asked them to repaire. They told us OK but they did not repair it.
There are not fridge, hair drier and safety box in the rooms. Fridge and hair drier are the most necessary thing in Bali.
The rooms are full of Termite. We asked them to use a spray or something but they did not.
We ate in balcony, but the day after they did not clean it. The room service was super low.
There was not even a rubbish bin in the rooms.
The only positive things are the shape and design which is nice and also the location which is close to monkey forest and nice places.
I do not recommend this hotel at all. Of course with this budget we could find better places.","The hotel is lovely with beautiful gardens and friendly staff. Basic but tasty breakfast. The room was a bit outdated, specially the bathroom, but for the price we paid and the amount of time we stayed (3 nights) that didn't bother us too much. They do have newer renovated rooms, but it was double the price of the older rooms. We were only there for a few days and we were out and about exploring Ubud most of the day, so this hotel totally met our needs. Monkeys wander around the property since the Monkey Forest surrounds the area, and that was kinda cool too.
I would definitely stay at this hotel again but I'd probably stay in one of the renovated rooms next time.","I understand that the Hotel is very old  and needs remodeling, however  for them to only have very brown discolored previously white  towels with brown spots on them and the bathrooms very dirty with leaks from the toilet, I think that is very poor","The staff were all very friendly and the property is very nice. The service was slow, not organized and they had troubles communicating with us clearly. We didn‚Äôt get to have the breakfast because Expedia made a mistake and the hotel didn‚Äôt have record of us paying extra for breakfast. The room was spacious and clean, but had quite a few ants and the safe didn‚Äôt work.","We are staying for 1 week at Garden View in two Superior rooms. The room does not look like the pictures, is very old and not cozy at all (as the pictures show the bedding was full of stains). Ants everywhere in the toilet and bedroom, and spiders. Smells like dust and humidity so ventilation and cleaning is not enough and there are many spider nets and dust between the bed and the wall and also in the bathroom. No curtain on the shower and neither on the window of the toilet so when you shower people from the balconies in front can see you.   One of the only three electrical plugs for electricity was broken and also the door knob. We spoke to the staff many times asking to change us to a different room but the only ones available were Luxury and they forced us to pay twice the price. Definitely not worth it for the money you pay, there are many luxurious villas at the same or even less price. The only good thing is the garden and the pool, and the quiet area but at the same time a door step to Ubud centre."
