Payangan, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80572, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=2347912510508577319,OPERATIONAL,,park,"tourist_attraction, park",3.6,199,,"One of the few places to see intact native forest (ie not secondary agroforest). Many trees identified with species information, but no common names. Nicely paved trail, maybe 1km. Abandoned at time of visit.","It's basically a huge forest with some interesting architecture and loads of  gigantic trees  and getting there is also pretty cool it's a road trip and getting there by scooter was an adventure, you need to pay attention to street signs because if you don't getting there will be really hard.","I rode my scooter for an hr to find this place, it’s a little tricky to find however It is still not finished but the ride there alone is so much fun! Cool to walk around and get lost in though will be worth another visit when/if it’s finished","This place is strategic, beatiful viewa around. the garden is not maintained and looks dirty.. Not recomemded to visit, just until the project finished","-: Still not fully ready for visitor and I suggests they need to put more interests or at least small museum or anything beside the walking path.
+: bring your bike for good experience of biking in the forests, the path is quite stable"
