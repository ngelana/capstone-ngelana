Cleaning staff washed to used cups and spoon in bathroom wash basin and left the spoons there also not cleaned properly.,"The location has only one way car access to go to the hotel, very small and narrow for a car. And the road is rocky and slippery when it's raining. But the room and the privateness is very nice.","The best value for money I ever had.
The rooms are clean and new, everything is working and in good condition.
The pool is nice.
Only six rooms so it‚Äôs very quiet.
It‚Äôs located just 15min ride outside of Ubud and the location has not been a problem at all.
The staff is always present, nice and helpful.
All perfect.",Poorly maintained room and bed bugs on our beds!! Me and my family had many rashes after sleeping on the bed and immediately cancel the rest of our stay there. Room is damp and bathroom not clean. Location is very rural (barely can fit 1 car and the road has no street light at night).,"It‚Äôs such a lovely place. Very clean and comfy. The staff is very friendly, the pool is great and the food available there is super tasty. Also it is pretty close to ubud, easy to reach by grab, even though it‚Äôs located on a street that‚Äôs not paved. Highly recommend, definitely would return"
