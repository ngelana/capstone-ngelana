Even I felt a bit queasy as we made our way back up the steep cliffs to where our motorcycles were parked. For those who may struggle with walking, have joint issues, or are elderly, I highly recommend renting one of the motorcycles available at the entrance gate or the parking gazebo.

The motorbike rental comes at an affordable price of just 25,000 Indonesian Rupiahs for a single ride. This option is far superior to embarking on a laborious hike that could potentially leave you exhausted midway. It's an excellent alternative that could prevent any unwanted mishaps during your journey.

Overall, the landscape is exceptionally exquisite, featuring pristine sands and an atmosphere that perfectly caters to those seeking a tranquil beach experience. Whether you're looking to simply relax by the sea or yearning for a peaceful retreat, this destination is an ideal choice.","Gorgeous beach to catch the sunset.
A very steep hill to and from the beach, which you can drive down, with parking down below.",LOVE THIS BEACH!!! so empty!!!! the walk down is pretty steep so be careful!! but take note there‚Äôs no connection there so if you are thinking of booking a gojek your way up it is not possible!!! but there‚Äôs locals offering motorbike services so don‚Äôt worry!!!!!!,"Very beautiful beach, very clean, the waves very calm so perfect for swimming. The sunset view ia also beautiful to.","Such a beautiful beach.
It's better to come in the morning, because it's not crowded and can enjoy the natural pool comfortably.
To enter this beach, we only need to donate an unspecified amount (it's up to you)"

As a Bali off-season (Southern Summer) coastal soaring spot this is as good as it gets. It catches the prevailing SW winds, whereas the other take-offs on the eastern side of the peninsula are often too cross to fly at this time of year.

It works virtually every day. Winds are usually  a little less reliable earlier in the day, but wonderfully reliable, smooth and laminar later.

It‚Äôs beautiful soaring along the cliff, above a picturesque section of beach, with surfers below. Sunset flights are fab with the air sometimes becoming very buoyant in the dying late afternoon winds.

Basic Acro height is a bit limited but doable, a reserve deployment would probably result in tree landing or sandy beach

The take-off/topland spot is made from a prepared netting, with plenty of space. As with all cliff landings, care has to be taken with rotor if you are approach too far from behind. Landing on the beach is safe if you lose height, with road access and an easy taxi ride back up just to the west side of the take-off. There is a small clubhouse with amenities, and a busy tandem centre.

Sadly, the enjoyment is only limited by the length of cliff flying area which is reduced due to local rules and the fact that you run out of beach which means safety would be an issue.  However, you can still see the Uluwatu Temple on the west side, although aren‚Äôt allowed to fly close to it. (As is the case with all Temples in Bali) Radio and shoes are required, but can be supplied by the location and a fee for flying at the private location must also be paid.

The local pilots are a very friendly, helpful and skilled bunch, quite a few are XC competitors and can offer considerable flying knowledge on flying in Bali and the region.

The spot doesn‚Äôt work so well in the Bali Off-season (South winter) as the prevailing wind swings S and becomes more cross here",Beautiful Place with awesome soaring above the cliff. Do a Tandem there they are save & Professionals ü™Ç‚ú®üåûüî•,"Had an amazing time there. The staff and pilot are friendly and helpful. And the view is super nice, with the clear ocean and clean beach, with some greenery view. Will never forget this experience.","It's a tourism firm that discriminates against other paragliding pilots who fly solo, saying that you can't fly just so they can fly with their tandem, I don't recommend it to everyone solo","Great paragliding experience, cool sunset view.
But the road to this place isn't very good."

We spent two nights there, the view from the villa is unique. The beach is long and preserved from too many tourists. The experience was mesmerizing! The staff is very friendly and always helpfull at any time. 100% recommended","Booked this accommodation for a one-night romantic getaway. What can I say, everything was perfect.
Firstly, the view of course. There‚Äôre not many people in that part of the beach, so it feels very secluded, like the whole ocean‚Äôs all yours. But just keep in mind that you‚Äôll have to walk approximately 10min along the beach to get there, so don‚Äôt forget to put on some Sunscreen and wear a hat.
Secondly, the space itself is great. The bubble is air-conditioned well, you can also close the curtains around your bed if you wanna hide from the sun (which is very aggressive during the day, so you should keep that in mind and better not forget your sunscreen and some hat). There‚Äôs also a fridge there, and I advice to keep all your food there, as otherwise bugs can find it. The open bathroom is very beautiful, you‚Äôre showering and looking over the mountains, while no one else can see you.
The swimming pool was also great, it has some lighting which allows you to swim there even at night.
There‚Äôs also some roofed space with a couch and a table where you can have your meal.
Also, the service is very good. I messaged the manager in advance, and they prepared some barbecue equipment which also included some snacks and some additional night lanterns (all for additional price), which made the space look magical at night.
All in all, I must say we had a perfect day. I would definitely recommend booking this accommodation for one night, it‚Äôs worth all the money spent!","If you are a nature person or insects do not bother you, then this is the place to stay. Beautiful view beautiful bed and amazing facilities. However, the sofas weren‚Äôt a bit clean. The AC in the room was not working well enough till 10pm at night. Moreover, you can not stay inside the room in the morning from 8am because of the direct sunlight. We didn‚Äôt order food from there so can‚Äôt say, but we ordered through ‚Äúgrab‚Äù. There were honeybees in the morning roaming around which made us uneasy to go out or be in the garden with peace of mind. Couldn‚Äôt use the bathroom because of very less lighting and open. It is a good experience for one night or few hours because of the heat. We checked-out at 10am.","Really enjoy staying in this bubble hotel nyang nyang beach for weekend. 2N3D is enough for me. I arrived about 7pm and Biim really helpful to waiting and assist me and very friendly. Well all the server are very nice and friendly.

Perfect place to spend romantic gateway. The food are delicious, the view is spectacular. Sleeping under the stars, sound of waves for 24h, the breeze, all perfect. The first night I couldn't sleep, the waves sound hitting the rock made me a bit scared with tsunami, a bit uncomfortable for the first time but I can sleep well in the 2nd night.

During the day it is impossible to stay in the bubble, we need to be in gazebo to chill and relax there. It would be perfect if they can provide fan in it since it still too hot. Need more higher plants for shade and chill.

Bbq was nice and flower bath was amazing.

If you go there, better to just bring backpack or keep your luggage in reception area and please wear comfortable shoes instead of sandals. Since we walk along the beach for about 20mins.

We got rashes on our skin, I think its from the outdoor bed/bench. We out towel for sure but its still dirty, maybe some mites bite. They better to wash it or clean it more regular.","We came to relax together, a very beautiful and fascinating place, there is an atmosphere of romance, the rest was unforgettable, we advise you too"

In a fantastic location with amazing room and very exotic settings and views.

Owned by a local person and staff are just amazing.

I also rented my bike from them and the price was very fair and they accommodated all my needs.

If you need any information about the island the amazing staff there have good english and are more than happy to share information with you.","We had an incredible 3 days at this accommodation. Incredibly warm people who help with everything. The rooms were clean, spacious, and had outdoor bathrooms. We were also able to rent a scooter on-site to explore the city center (10-15min)","Very relaxing ambience. Mr Oblong and his wife welcomed us warmly and super helpful. The food are delicious. Beautiful scenery. They provided clean room, well maintained facilities. Perfect place for those who wants to avoid city crowds. Would definitely come back!","Room is basic without kettle, or free bottled water. Please bring your own water or you can buy at the restaurant for 10K IDR.
Outdoor bathroom is a plus but it‚Äôs very hot in the afternoon and melted all my toiletries bottles. Be careful of what you leave in the open bathroom.
Internet is wonky and sometimes does not connect at all. It‚Äôs frustrating if you‚Äôre a big internet person. We would suggest to get off the grid and enjoy the surroundings instead.
Paragliding at your doorstep is a plus.
Small restaurant with very reasonably priced dishes is a huge plus.
You can rent the motorbike directly with the hotel owner, too.","It is one of those locations that by:
1. position (located on a plateau that dominates the coastal area),
2. authentic look (bungalow built from a combination of wood and volcanic rock) and
3. very welcoming staff (both the lady, who cooked very tasty traditional dishes and Oblong, who was every time ready to help us and answer any of our concerns/questions so our experience in Bali is as pleasant as possible),
made us think that we booked too few days and that we would like to stay more.
Very clean room, comfortable mattress, very interesting and fun experience with the open bathroom, which was very clean. Also, the accommodation provided us towels, shower gel and shampoo and a capsule for mosquitoes in the room so we had no warries.
You should definitely choose this location if you are in Uluwatu and you want a quieter location."
