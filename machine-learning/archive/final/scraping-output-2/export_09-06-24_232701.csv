Most of the good reviews on here are by the staff who work there.","Villa Perancis resort is a hidden gem! The staff is incredibly friendly, offering a warm welcome with a drink. They provide a wide range of activities like snorkeling ü§ø, scuba diving, and fishing trips. You can also enjoy Balinese massages and daily Yoga/Qi gong. The resort beautifully combines Indonesian üáÆüá© and European üá™üá∫ architecture with eco-friendly features, all while maintaining a luxurious and spacious feel. Highly recommended for a memorable and environmentally conscious getaway.","Beautiful and quiet place surrounded by nature with salt water swimming pool and yoga shala.
The breakfast is yummy, special and different than other breakfast that you get from other hotels. üåà‚ú® Great place for retreat ‚ú®üíñ family and coupleüíñ","Villa Perancis is a total vibe! üå¥ Staff are super chill, greeted us with drinks right off the bat. üçπ So many cool things to do: snorkeling, fishing, and scuba diving for starters. üé£ If you're into wellness, the Balinese massages and daily Yoga/Qi Gong are a must-try. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Love the mix of Euro and Indonesian style, plus it's all eco-friendly! üåè Breakfast is bomb, and shoutout to all the staff  for being awesome hosts. üëè Hope to return someday for sure !",We did a cacao ceremony with them.

They allowed our dog to stay the night too, thank you for that. There is however only 1 air condition in the room, installed upstairs, so the room downstairs was hot even after we maxed the AC.

The area is nice and very quiet since it is quite far from the main road. The swimming pool is really nice. For divers, there is a dive shop next door.

The staff who checked us in was friendly, but the one who was on duty the next day until we checked out was not so. Also when we asked to make our breakfast and keep them until we came back from a snorkeling trip, they said okay, but when we wanted to claim it, they said they didn't make it. But the hotel manager Pak Made was kind, he granted our request for late check out due to our snorkeling trip, thank you Pak Made.","Very nice hotel.  Deluxe rooms, specially the shower! Very good food and nice staff.  Easy to book diving activity with excellemt monitors.","Friendly staff, nice bungalow that is out of the main street, the provided food and menu are not that great.. But there are a lot of great warung (small restaurant) within 30minutes drive","This is best place for indian food in Bali, Wonderful atmosphere and lovely staff",Amazing place close with amed beach
