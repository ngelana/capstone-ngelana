All kinds of creepy creatures crawl here and there in your stay and inside your room. Night time this creatures make wierd sounds which leads to having a sleepless night. Breakfast is too worst ,manager pretends to be a police officer , when we complain about any issue with the stay, he blackmails us to call police. Evryone here are fraud. They gave us broke jet in bathroom and blamed us for it and took total of 2M money from us. We had to catch our boat same day afternoon hence we were helpless ,so we had to pay him huge hugee amount of 2M to let us go. Never stay here, zero security , when u go out to roam , staff goes inside your room and tries out all ur belongings. When complained about it they are just laughing. All of them are big mafia batch. Beware and opt to stay on roads instead at this stay. I feel this will be helpful to you all","This hotel is full of fraud people. If you complaint about hot water not coming or any other problem regarding room,they say they call police. They ask double thrible money and blackmail you until we give them the money. Manager putu says he is a police but he is a fraud. Dont stay here ,staff enter room when your not at hotel and steel valuables . If ask for missing things. They simply laugh.","We had to run for our safety!

We had a 3-night booking and after complaining about the hot water, we were told at midnight to pack our bags and leave immediately because we were ""too complicated"".
Meanwhile, their marketing manager, threatened us on the phone with ""Immigration issues"" if we escalated or made any complaint - he said: ""Be very careful, we have your passport photos (taken on arrival) We can make you problems with Immigration.""
I have photos and voice notes, actual evidence. We asked, begged for them to call the police to understand what was happening and they refused it. Instead they gave us a ""compensation"" in return for us to leave immediately and when they did, they started chasing us out of the place (me and my partner).
For your own safety, do not stay at this place. Or if you do, do not complain about the hot water - They say it has a 25l capacity but the photo speaks for itself.
And when they do ""call the police"" - they invite a local friend who was intoxicated, give him a beer and a pack of cigarettes and say ""act like a cop"".

Not to mention the breakfast - You have to make the order the previous night and in the morning when you have it, it looks and tastes like it was made the night before - surprise!
The scooter they charge you $100.000 rupiah but if you walk down to the other hotels/hostels they are honest and charge you 70/80.000.
The view is amazing, no doubt. But the way we had to leave the island the next morning, afraid that we being chased by the staff, was so not worthy. They even sent us a message via Whatsapp the next morning to let us know they still had the photos of our passports!","Pros
Staff are polite & helpful.
Place is very well maintained.
View is really good, can see ocean & mount Agung across sea.
Food is good/decent.
Each stay has a big bath tub.

Cons
Access is not convenient, one has to take a steep road & then a mud road to reach. Thankfully the last stretch is well lit.
Hot water limit of 25 liters. After the limit one has to wait for 20 mins to get hot water. This does not affect regular shower, but is inconvenient while using bath tub. They could have better put smaller bath tubs.","very pretty looking hotel with kind attentive staff, lovely pool that you can use at any time of the day, we enjoyed our one night stay but must say that breakfast could've been better and this hotel definitely needs a visible sign to direct customers when it is pitch black as the sign has no visible light; we missed the hotel 3 times in one evening due to this."

It is the most peaceful place I have been in Indonesia.  The houses are almost new with a lovely box spring bed and clean.  The owner is very hospitable and helpful.  During a stay here it is recommended to rent a scooter.  The nearest restaurant is around a 25 minute walk downhill.  The climb up is especially quite intensive.  I would like to recommend this place to anyone looking for peace and beautiful views.,I felt very comfortable with the atmosphere here. You can avoid the atmosphere of the city crowd and calm while on vacation. You can get experiences like this for a small fee,Nice and quiet cottage.,,
