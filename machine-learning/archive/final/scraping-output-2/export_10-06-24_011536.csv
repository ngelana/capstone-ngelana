Balangan Beach, we must say, it was an exceptional experience. The service was impeccable, the staff was attentive friendly especially the Manager as I remembered his name is Mr Coco ( my apologies if I didnt remembered his name correctly ). The ambiance was inviting with a cozy atmosphere and tasteful decor, as for the food, every dish exceeded my expectation in terms of flavor, presentation, and quality of ingredients. Overall, for my fiance who is typical picky eater and me would love culinary so much, we would highly recommend Cafe La Pasion for anyone looking for a dining experience that combines excellent service, a pleasant environment and delicious food.","Oh wow an oasis! - amazing food and lovely staff. If you’re in the area you just gotta stop by.
Nachos off the scale and flautas and quesadillas amazing
Spicy margarita- esp frozen is awesome
Shame we go home tomorrow otherwise we’d def be back
Indoors or outdoor seating and a lovely small pool if you did need to cool off","We have visited here a number of times whilst on holiday in Uluwatu. It’s well worth the visit!

The staff here are truly wonderful and welcoming. They remembered us each time and couldn’t do enough to ensure we were happy.

The food…wow! We had a gorgeous meal and the portion size was just right! They also accommodate all palettes and dietary requirements.

We can’t wait to return, where we will see the live music or enjoy the film night. Thank you Cafe La Pasion and we shall see you soon!","I had thee best break burrito here this morning. Fresh, delicious and altered  to my dietary needs. Also had the morning smoothie which was delicious, and mocha (coffee) was the best I’ve had in my 3 weeks here.
Staff are very friendly, helpful and speak great English (if that’s your flow).

Thank you for being here!!!!
🌻","I recently had the pleasure of dining at this hidden gem of a café, and I must say, the experience was nothing short of fantastic. The atmosphere exudes positive vibes, creating a warm and inviting ambiance that instantly puts you at ease.

The staff deserves special mention for their outstanding service – friendly, attentive, and genuinely passionate. Koko the manager is so warm and friendly.

The menu boasts a diverse selection of delectable dishes that cater to various tastes. The quality is superb, and each bite is a burst of flavor that leaves a lasting impression. Whether you’re a food enthusiast or someone just looking for a delightful meal, this place has something for everyone."

The hotel is wonderful! Clean rooms, working air conditioning, breakfast and the perfect pool to jump in after a hot day of exploring.

The family who run the place are really lovely as well and gave us lots of advice. Even the little kids were excited to run up and welcome us to the hotel.","The worst hotel I have ever been to. The hotel was once in good condition, apparently, as soon as it was built.  Now everything in it is shabby, in mold.  This hotel is like a horror movie.  The roof of the pavilion comes off and dangles in the wind.  In the room ""cottage"" mold, holes in the ceiling through which you can see the stars or pouring rain.  Some torn rags hang on the balcony. They used to be curtains from the sun.  The light on the terrace does not work. The owners do not change the light bulbs.  A large number of mosquitoes.  I booked this hotel after looking at the nice photos.  But they do not correspond to reality.  We booked a cottage room, but upon arrival at the hotel, they said it was unavailable and offered a cheaper option.  When I asked politely for a refund, the hotel worker said he would talk to the owner.  I didn't receive any refund.  I Wrote to the hotel and received no response.  My advice is to stay away from this abandoned place.","If I could give 0 stars I would! Don’t book this hotel!
Fully booked, no contact, no help, no refund! And definitely nothing like the pictures.

We arrived there by car, after a long drive. No one to be found at first, to number on the website. So we waited until one of the cleaners walked in. The first thing I noticed is how run down the place is. The pictures you see on the website are of a much better time. I didn’t see the rooms, but I wasn’t all that excited anymore for my stay.
The boy looked with big eyes when we told him we had a booking, after some calls he told me they were fully booked.
After questions about my refund and over an hour wait to get in contact with the owner, which never happened, we booked somewhere else and left.
I got a number from a woman who gave me an American number from the owner, no WhatsApp or way to contact him without making extreme costs.
As if this isn’t bad enough, I got a message from agoda that they don’t want to refund me the money, because they ‘weren’t fully booked’. I’ve sent them evidence and still waiting for a refund.
Avoid this disgusting place with these terrible people! They’re only in for the money.","Came to check in at 2 o'clock even that I messaged owned the day before if it's ok to check in earlier (still didn't respond) just to find out that the hotel is full!!! I made this reservation 10 days before check in and no one bothered to message me that it's overbooked... The place itself doesn't look like on photos. For example here's pool... Normally I don't do bad reviews but this just crossed the line. We were driving 2h to get there just to kiss the door... Very unprofessional behaviour from owner as he don't care about coustumers. No apologies. Just a message ""free cancellation""... No words for this servis.",The staff was friendly and helpful. But they have bungalows and rooms. I booked a double room which seems decent on the pictures. There was a terrible chemical smell in the room. There was a lot of mold. The staff put perfume in the room when we first said bad smell. Especially the bathroom was really bad and smelled even worse than the bedroom. We felt extremely unwell and couldn’t stay there. We was booked this room for 12days but we leave after two days since no other rooms were available.

And his Spanish Tortilla is the best I have ever tried outside Spain (and rivalling some of the best I have tried in Spain)","Amazing place.

They said that the rooms with air conditioning were fully booked and offered me a room with a fan.
I told them that I couldn't stay in a room without a/c. They told me that I could go to another hotel. Which I did.
I contacted Agoda for a refund and they tried to get in touch with the guesthouse for days. After 5 days, they said that the guesthouse would not issue a refund.
I understand the fact that this guesthouse is managed by people that have no clue about how to use online booking platforms. But the way Agoda treats its customers is shocking.
Update: I contacted the guesthouse directly and they sent me a refund.
Don’t trust Agoda with helping you with anything, tho.","I had a booking there but when I arrived they said the booking is for an different hotel a few minutes away. When I arrived at this hotel it hooked them forever to give me my room, I had an room with air con booked but ended up in one with just a fan and you couldn’t look the door. Also the staff who sended my to the other hotel was really rude.","Good staff, really clean room, with Wood walls. Bé careful of noise! The room has so space. There is in the middle of peace road, you have supermarket 10 minuts walking and different restaurants near by. Bathhroom is clean and working

Will recommend 100%!","Wouldn’t recommend. The Lady’s at the place didn’t really make me feel comfortable - I was in a room without AC & they offered me another one without me asking(the Ac was not working properly tho) and electricity went off two times during my two night stay. The bathrooms were really minimalistic and the light in the rooms depressing.
would recommend stretching the Budget a bit and going for something else.","Made Roejas is the nicest person in Bali. She has extremely fair prices and also makes amazing food. She helped me many times when I ran into problems like fixing a scooter or how to get around the island. Rooms are comfortable, they have what you need. Location is central to everything you want to see in Bali. 10/10 recommend"

I don’t like to give negative reviews but in this case I have to. This place has so much potential, but something is really wrong with the staff and service. Very bad hygiene and cleaning in all areas: room, pool, restaurant, shared kitchen. I don’t want to go too much in detail, but even for european with low expectations this place would not be okay to stay. I hope this review opens the eyes to change to the better. 🙏","The staff here are the least helpful I've ever experienced anywhere. There's a young local guy working here who is rude, unhelpful and lazy. Honestly, I'm astounded! I made my booking a week in advance, and yet when I arrived, my room was dirty, cluttered and this young man was just sitting, playing on his phone. I had to stand and wait while he made my room ready. Why this could not have been done at any point during the week before I arrived baffles me. Also, the kitchen is filthy and nobody comes to clean the rooms or offer clean towels etc unless you ask repeatedly. For the steep price I paid, I feel like this was terrible value and could not recommend it any less if I tried","Sorry- but this place is just not enjoyable. Directly at the road, plenty of traffic. On the first look it seemed ok, thats why we gave it a try. On the card is international food. We went for a pizza and some garlic bread. Garlic bread was already burned and soaked with oil. Pizza Margarita came with tomatos on it, even if it wasnt supposed to. Its not at all pizza dough. It was completly unenjoyable. The pizza sauce didnt look or taste like pizza sauce at all. Also alot of dogs at the restaurant, even dog poo on the floor. We both ate like 1 piece and decided to go. I even said "" i dont want to be rude, but this is no good food for us"". No sorry, no question what to do better or maybe order something else. They charged us the full price: 195k for 2 pizza, garlic bread and 2 drinks. No goodbye aswell.

Guys, there is plenty of really delicious food in uluwatu, just stay away from this place.","Only came to the restaurant. Had to get our own menu, wasn’t told 2/3 of menu wasn’t available until we tried to order, drinks never arrived so we got them ourselves from the fridge, then tried to overcharge us for them, and a great amount of large flying insects constantly landing on you.

Although, the chicken cashew and chicken burritos was delicious! Just a shame about the service.","Break-ins in the rooms, dirty pool, questionable hygiene... everything to please, what a shame to give this image to such a beautiful country...
The staff is also incredibly unpleasant.
I strongly advise against this experience."

The receptionists are very friendly, helpful, and informative. They gave us free voucher to Dreamland Waterpark located behind the hotel. The waterpark looks old, the water wasn't clean enough, but that was not problem as my daughter likes it. One thing that made me sad from the hotel was that the garden was not well maintained. It looked so dried.",Hotel is completely advertised incorrectly. The hotel is no where near 4 stars. It's a one star or 2 star the most. The wallpapers are peeling off the walls. The windows are dirty. It smells mouldy in the room. Water doesn't get hot. Cushions are dirty. I couldn't even sit on the couches around the lobby because they are full of dirty stains. It shows there are pools in the photos but there are not. These are photos of neighbouring beach clubs and the waterpark next door. The staff are friendly and helpful though and it's good that it's got an elevator.,"The Lorin New Kuta Hotel perhaps might have once aspired to be a 4 star accommodation, but that ""dream"" was over long ago. It is not close to this and it is more of a two star accommodation at best. If you are going to stay here, you should have your own transport otherwise the costs of transport will cover a higher price at a better accommodation in a better location. There is no shuttle offered and to get to the beach is a significant walk for anyone wishing to do so. The room I had ( I spent five nights ) was big enough with a view, but its walls are paper-thin and I had a restless night being awoken by young women from a Chinese tourist group with their gabbing and laughing until 2 a.m. The TV broke down the first night. The toilet did not work the second night. The internet was unavailable for the last three nights of my stay and I had to use my personal hot spot. To stay here one has to use a lot of one's own personal things as the amenities provided are thin and nothing close to a the 4 star treatment one would expect and which the hotel has given itself. Di rigeur, the staff are friendly and do their best in a hopeless situation. Attending to the repairs and addressing the problems was done with punctuality and a certain sense of irony and humour, I thought. My recommendation is to find another accommodation since you could do much better with the money that this place costs.","A bit old room, very standard bedroom, bathroom not maintenance well.
Change the room because there was a very bad smell in the first room, and sadly, the next room isn't quite good too, because the AC wasn't cold enough.
The Lift needs more maintenance, there's a loud noise when the lift stopped.
A bit dark on the coridor (on th 4th floor), because too many light bulbs that didn't work.
Overall, it's not a good stay, too bad"

We booked the villa from the 22nd till the 1st of January. My correspondence with the owner started months ago as i was doing a surprise wedding there , which was supposed to be a secret and a surprise to my guest. This of course turned out not be a surprise since the owner Jenny had told some members of the group about the wedding before we arrived on the island. I have exchanged more than 70 e-mail with the owner jenny for a simple dinner and a few requests to be directed to the best local shop for some quality alcohol and some ideas for decoration, the main issue is the English of the owner which is below bad and can sometimes lead to misleading e-mails that Do not answer your questions , but create unwanted topics that drag on for another 5 e-mails
The issue with this was that when the bill was for driving us to a destination the amounts were always 50 % or more % higher than a normal Taxi or the service wasn't provided. I had an incident and had to go to the hospital, a route that a friend of mine used several days earlier and on the last day i paid twice the amount, no amount was ever the same for the same destination. We had one of the drivers there take us to a luxury resort to spend the night with my wife and he was supposed to pick us up on the next day , which didn't happen and we spent 3 hours waiting for no one. Later on i was asked to pay even for that trip which i refused and was billed only for the going over there part the amount of 125 000 IDR, to compare a random taxi billed us 100000 IDR for the same route. Now i know when calculated in other currencies this doesn't amount to much, but you can imagine a group of 17 people that are located in this area, which is far away from all the major sights, and that cannot use UBER or Grab due to some local ban that we were never warned about are often using some similar service provided by the staff (Kadek seemed to be in charge).
On the day of my wedding, we had an agreement with the owner to use loud speakers until 11 PM and then continue until 2-3 AM on small Bluetooth speakers we had quietly, i was asked to turn off the music by one of the staff who was on the phone with Jenny at 10:30 PM , then when 11 PM past we switched up the speaker due to the rain and moved it further away , so there is less noise. This all resulted in the electricity of the villa being shut down. This is when i lost it completely as i had received several mails from the owner , threatening us with the local people burning us , then i asked why were we billed 200 USD for a wedding fee , which was described as a fee charged by the local government for such occasions that might run late and cause noise. The answer was in poor English and changed the theme quickly.
We confronted the staff to turn the lights back as there were some people injured stepping on glass in the dark and we noticed several people in the villa that weren't identified as part of the staff, it turned out that this was one of the people from the villa next door , who ordered the power down, They complained about us, which is funny considering their guest were drunk each night and in the morning you can see them sleeping on the street passed out drunk from the night before.
Breakfast was all sorts of eggs and noddles with eggs, and this for 7000 EUR , i don't think so.
We have seen since that they offer the same for twice the amount, so we feel very violated in terms of trust.
Every time we complained about something, we were bargained with something free so we can write a 5 star review, i have at least 12 mails on the subject.
We had people rent motors and fill the tank only to comeback to no fuel, as Kadek and co. drove them with no permission.
I was given another hand written note for a couple of soft drink that they wanted us to pay having in mind we spend more than 8 Million IDR the previous day in the local shop on soft drinks for the wedding and filled 2 fridges","Nice place. For groups of 14 - 18 persons. You can rent a the rooms to have a big private villa. Friendly staff that unfortunately barely speaks English.
Located in the middle of nowhere, 20min walk to the beach","Not good value for money. Rooms are tiny and my walls had mouldy patches. Upstairs by the bar area they had birds in tiny tiny cages, which as an animal lover, sickened me. I pointed out the cruelty of this to the owner/bar guy and ge just laughed. Horrible horrible place. STAY AWAY","Very bad experience. if you want to enjoy Bali spirit, better skip and choose another place.","Villa confortunetly, is close to New Kuta Hotel,to relax with friends or family"
