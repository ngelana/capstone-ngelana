The best view, hospitable staff and excellent service. A hot jacuzzi was appropriate as it is quite cool in Kintamani. I was surprised by the availability of all hygiene products , bathrobes , clean bed linen and towels. No doubt we will come back here again.","Staff super responsive, the view is amazing, the hot tub in front is a plus. One of the best experience you can get!","Very good experience here. the staff name KADEM very good, efficient, helpful, surely will
come back here.,","From the moment we arrived the service was bad. They basically drop you there and don’t explain anything. Not sure if it’s the language barrier, but it was not very welcoming.

We asked for scooter rental in advance and they said when you arrive you can arrange. At first it was not possible later on they dropped us at a scooter rental to rent one. Very poor bike and expensive, which is of course not the property’s fault. But can be manager better.. especially considering it’s a rough road to enter.

It looks more like a place where people come to shoot content for their Instagram and describe how amazing it is while they’re basically either invited or pretend having a good time. The swimming pool didn’t look clean, too many flies during the day it’s very hard to relax and enjoy.. but again the flies are literally everywhere in Kintamani…

The breakfast was so little, it wasn’t even enough for my 1.5 year old son… but yeah

There are so many other places you can go and are so much better believe me we’ve been to 2 others in the area and both had excellent service and experience"
