It's a lovely spot to hang out with your loved one. You might only see the elevator from the parking area, but when you get down to the restaurant, you will be welcomed by a perfect combination of modern interior design and the great scenery plus the good weather of Kintamani. I chose the creamy pasta, but unfortunately, it didn't taste very creamy to me, though it was still acceptable. The hot chocolate was a perfect companion for someone who can‚Äôt drink coffee.

Additionally, the waiters were helpful in assisting customers with choosing from the menu.","Ultra modern coffee shop with incredible views of an active volcano! There are a couple of ""speciality"" coffee shops on this road, but I was recommended this place by a local speciality coffee farm owner, and it didn't disappoint! The place itself is a work of art, one of the most impressive coffee shops I've ever visited. Even if you don't like coffee, it's worth visiting to enjoy the views and architecture. We were greeted as we entered by a friendly server and given a menu, but after some time no one came to take our order, after getting the attention of another server they eventually came. We ordered 1x cappuccino and 1x piccolo, which were served with oat milk as standard. There were 4 choices of beans available to choose from, and I opted for the most interesting sounding one. The coffee was good but served a bit on the cold side. We both ordered some soup, one tomato and one butternut squash, and they were good but once again served a bit cold. Not much coffee chat either which is unfortunate. We visited around 1:30 and it wasn't too busy. Worth checking out if you're in the area.","This swanky cafe just along Kintamani's main road is a must visit cause it stands out than the rest! Once you get down and the elevator opens, you'll be greeted with an ultra modern decor plus a stunning wide view towards Mount Batur. Simply head over to the long balcony if you want to enjoy the view and the cool air. Best to go there early in morning, and they open at 5:30 to make sure anyone gets the sunrise.

Excellent coffee and they offer breakfast dishes like fried rice, egg benedict, bubur ayam betutu, and many more. Sadly they don't offer tea, only a wedang jahe but thankfully it's good. I guess it's because coffee is their main speciality here.

Worth the visit. Highly recommended if you're visiting Kintamani.","If you're looking for a coffee lounge with an unbeatable view of Mount Batur, look no further! This hidden gem combines the aroma of freshly brewed coffee with the breathtaking sight of Bali's iconic volcano. With comfortable seating and friendly staff, it's the perfect spot to start your day or unwind after a hike. Whether you're a coffee enthusiast or simply seeking serenity in nature's beauty, this place won't disappoint.","One of the best sunrise viewing spots in Kintamani. Their speciality is coffee as we already knew. I tried only their cake and cappuccino. Those were quite good and recommended.

Quick tips, please be mindful with the timing of your arrival, it might be busy and full of clouds or foggy üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è On the other hand, if you are lucky you will get a lot of breathtaking views of mountains and sunrise.üåÑ"

There were many meal selections, most of which didn't suit our palates. Some of the purportedly Indian foods weren't even remotely Indian. We did, however, find very few foods that satisfied our appetites. The restaurant's restrooms were immaculate‚Äîat least when we visited.","We went there only because our driver recommended it. They have tie ups. You need to visit this place only if you want to eat with a nice view. Nothing special about food. And way too costly. The view is good. I would recommend, you get in, take all the photos needed from the glass platform they have. And later go out and find another place to eat. They say Indian buffet. Nothing tastes Indian.","Even though we couldn't enjoy the view because it was too foggy, we still had a great time at this restaurant. The food and local coffee were delicious. Please try the black rice pudding & fried leaves. It was sweet and delicious.","Lunch with a view. The location of Batur Sari is a major selling point. You eat while you have a scenic view of Mt.Batur and Lake Batur.

For  Rp 110,000, you get to indulge on a buffet of various Balinese specialties. You have an option to either eat indoors or at the open area which has better view.

Food is good. Ambiance inside the reataurant needs to be improved. Place can be made cleaner.

Friendly and attentive staff.","The vegetarian indian buffet was disappointing.  Not many varieties too. For IDR15 thousand per head..just not worth it. The flavoured rice was too salty to my taste. We should have ordered some fries from the la carte menu ..more satisfactory. But the mount batur view was superb, make up for the lunch."

Not sure if it was the preset menu or the food in general is not that great but the service is decent and view of Mt Batur is very nice.,"Madu Sari Hotels & Restaurant is located opposite to the view point of Mt. Batur, one of the active volcanoes in Indonesia. The restaurant is a part of the hotel property and offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape. Our tour operator had organised a tour of the area and lunch at the Madu Sari Hotel & Restaurant was part of the package.

As a vegetarian, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the tour operator had arranged for Jain vegetarian food for me, while my wife was served non-vegetarian Indonesian-style cuisine. The staff at the restaurant had made a sincere effort to cater to my dietary preferences, and I appreciated their efforts.

The buffet spread included a variety of Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng, satay, and mie goreng. The non-vegetarian dishes were cooked in the Indonesian style, with spices and herbs that were unique to the region. My wife enjoyed the food and appreciated the flavours of the Indonesian cuisine.

The Jain vegetarian food, on the other hand, was not as flavourful as we had expected. The dishes lacked the spices and herbs that are usually used in Indian cuisine. However, we appreciated the effort that had gone into making the food and were happy that the restaurant had tried to cater to our dietary preferences.

The ambience of the restaurant was pleasant, with large windows that offered stunning views of the surrounding landscape. The service was prompt, and the staff was courteous and helpful. The restaurant also had an outdoor seating area that was perfect for enjoying the views and the cool breeze.

In conclusion, the Madu Sari Hotel & Restaurant is a great option for those who are looking to enjoy Indonesian cuisine while enjoying the stunning views of the Mt. Batur. While the Jain vegetarian food could have been better, we appreciated the effort that had gone into making it. The non-vegetarian dishes were a hit with my wife, and we enjoyed the overall experience at the restaurant.","I dont know where to start...

We stayed in this hotel one night.. I will share some photos for you to make a whole picture about the place.

We paid 200.000 ird for one night, which is (surprisingly) very low price for this area (in other places in Bali for this price you can stay in very decent places).

Pros
- hot shower,
- receptionist (guy who also cleans the rooms) was really nice to us - gave us freshly washed towels and tried to help us.

Cons
- we stayed in the room named Arjuna - room is in very bad conditions (we ask for another room, but there wasn't any..).
- room and shower was dirty (hair, dirt...) and mold - on the walls and on the pillows (I know that here is high humidity but this is really bad ....).
- and one last surprise on the wall by the toilet, I didn't examine it, but I hope it was piece of mud (not piece of shitüòÖ) - you can see also on the pictures.

Honestly now we are laughing to it but it was freaking horrible (I didnt sleep half of the nightüòÖ) - but I strongly recommend, dont go there :D at least to this room.
(I have to say that when we were leaving we saw from outside a few rooms which had new windows - so maybe there are some better options, BUT we dont know for sure...).",Nice place with mount Batur view..friendly staff

I was looking a quite coffee around Kintamani and I picked this place. I enjoy being here, not crowded and open air.

The Cappucino surprisingly was good. The owner should upgrade the Menus, so it will be look better.

The Staffs are nice and served us Good. I think they enjoy being here too.

The toilet was clean, located on the basement.

Tomato soup needs seasoning, its bland.

Cheese sandwich is more like salad sandwich, consist of cabbage, carrot, cucumber, mayonaise and shredded cheese. Its better to use cheese slice rather than shredded cheese, cause i can't taste the cheese at all.

Too much fly on the spot, the waiter should move quickly to remove the plates from the table to prevent the flies to gather.

May 2024","We were searching for an Indian vegetarian restaurant in the area and were disappointed by the many claiming they had Indian food. And then fortunately we saw this coffee shop and thankfully it did not smell like fish/non veg food in there. We decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed. We ordered vegetarian- cappuccino, fries, pizza, pasta and we were happy with all food because it smelt and tasted fine and like vegetarian food. There was a biscuit with cappuccino which tasted like it had egg in it but otherwise all other food items were a relief from all food at other bigger restaurants in the area. Service was also good. Atmosphere is also good. They cut a mango also for us which we had bought from somewhere else and served that to us in a plate. Thanks for that and feeding us veg food.
