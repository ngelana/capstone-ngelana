There isn't much to do or see other than that. From the entrance to the waterfall is about 5-8 minutes walk. The waterfall is nice to see, but to prepared to have your shoes wet. Best to bring some slippers. We stayed only about 20 minutes at the waterfall.","Great experience primarily to take photos.

📌 tickets are IDR 30k each to access

📌 The steps are steep and the ascend can be tiring if not in good physical condition

📌You will either need waterproof shoes or a good pair of flip flops but either way you will have to get your feet wet to walk to the waterfall - the path at the end is on pebbles","A beautiful and breathtaking waterfalls.
Need to walk down with steep steps but it was really worth it. You'll feel like you're on another planet. The rays of the sun makes it extraordinary...","Wonderful waterfall after around 15min walk (first half stairs down, then flat). Last few hundred meters is going through kneel deep water. Beautiful, in particular with sun rays. Downside: people queue for their ""exclusive"" Instagram pictures. It's a bit annoying. The wait for us was like ten minutes, but it was not crowded.. Can be probably easily 45min... Not good.

There's another smaller waterfall a bit downstream.

Bring swimwear and water proof equipment","Very beautiful waterfall. Very cool. Bring a waterproof bag since waterfall sprays water on you. Need rubber shoes for the water. Many people walking barefoot and they look like slow, not a pleasant walking. There are 204 steps to the bottom. It is awonder to see the Beauty and power of a waterfall. We can thank the volcanoe for raising the earth for us. Take a left at the bottom for the waterfall. Keep going all the way, under a short tunnel to the end. Many photo places beforehand too. Then take a right at the bottom for 2 other waterfalls. Very beautiful!"

The larger one, where the water falls down a wall in a semicircle, is very beautiful. Very popular photo motif. That's why it's worth arriving early to avoid long queues for photos.

Due to the high humidity and high steps, the descent or later ascent from this waterfalls is not advisable, especially for people with heart problems or who are not fit.

Make sure you go during the heat of the afternoon so you can catch the sun rays coming into the cave. Plan on bringing water shoes as you have to go through creeks and over rocks to get there.,"This place almost same like tukad cepung waterfall in Bangli

one from many hidden gorgeous canyon in Bali especially in Bangli

if we follow the maps we will stop at rice field that only can be through by bike or walk
There's another path that can be through by the car but unfortunately at that time the local won't tell us the place
The local want us through that path because they want sale their guide service & coconut
They said we got Rp10rb for green coconut but actually they give us yellow coconut 😓😓😓

The view so gorgeous, clear water & fresh air","A really nice waterfall. We were all alone when we visited. Important: there is about 1.5 km to do on a really small dirt roat. Possible by motorbike, but you must be a good driver, not easy to access!",So amazed with the view of waterfall and rice fields along the way to get there,"The air is still not polluted.

If you have play in the waterfall you might need hot drinks like teas or coffees. This place got you covered.

With a reasonable price and good comfort food you can stay here to enjoy the view and fresh air.

Very recomend for you to fill your stocmach.
Staff was friendly. And food comes fast.

Suitable for eating alone, with friends and family.",Burger was raw in the middle. Think they have frozen patties but didn’t even cook it enough to be rare. Just completely raw and not to be eaten. So wouldn’t recommend burger from there.,"I try to order beef rendang but they didnt have it,i was looking on the menu again and i choose soto ayam soup which they also dont have,in the end i took chicken and fried squid.
Chicken plate looks sad,squid was not fresh and smell of ammonia so i didnt eat it.
Waiters were acting like it was not the first time when somebody refuse to pay.
Glasses were dirty
Food quality for that prices are ridiculous.
Dont go there
I am sure there are better places arround","Wonderful forest catering surrounding, no doubt!
Enjoy the bright sunshine and bliss from nature, truly amazing! A real nice escape from urban lifestyle.

About the foods we ordered, at first the veggie sandwiches were standard for vegetarians, but omelette was little bit less tasty as usual.
The Balinese noodle dish we ordered was just fine. Juices were fresh but added too much ice to taste.

Well~ service and prices were fair and adequate. In fact, the customers’ dining areas must be improved. Such as broken wooden decks, garbage around and broken dirty toilets without toilet papers."

It was a quiet and peaceful place with greenery around. It took sometime for them to get the food. The service was okay. The food was good. They had their local cuisine and some burgers and pizzas. As we tried both it was good. Overall nice place to go to.,"After a refreshing walk to the waterfall, it's a great spot to unwind.
I enjoyed a delicious coffee. and the fried noodles were served with a flavorful spicy sauce.
The peaceful atmosphere, accompanied by good music and a picturesque view of the canyon, made it a truly memorable experience",Stunning Restaurant on the way down to tukad cepung with a proper coffee machine too which you can't find easily in the jungle in ubud. Breathtaking views and a little photo nest too.,Super polite staff with decent prices. Great for quick stop.,"Nice staff, good food and coffee. Didn't realize this restaurant is one of a few places located inside the grounds of a waterfall. They asked me to pay entry, but I actually wasn't there to see the waterfall-(didn't have enough time to go exploring)-so that is something to be aware of. They didn't charge me ultimately, but it was a bit of a surprise."
