The food was really tasty, and the vibe there was awesome. The owners, Sri and Bumbum were super friendly and made us feel like part of the family.

The hostel is a bit far from the main part of Ubud, but I actually liked that. It was nice and quiet, away from all the hustle and bustle. Plus, the view from the pool was just gorgeous!

One thing I loved was how easy it was to socialize. Whether by the pool or in the common areas, it felt like everyone was open to making friends.

Overall, I loved my stay at Bali Bamboo !  Great food, cool atmosphere, stunning pool view, easy socializing, and a peaceful location. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Ubud","We loved it. The owners are so lovely! The hostel is located 10km away from the busy city. Therefore it is very peaceful and there are a lot of nice ricefields abd waterfalls. The hostel provides many activities so as cooking classes, sunrise hiking on Mount Batur, jewelry making classes and many more. We loved every bit of our stay in the hostel.","From the moment I arrived, I was warmly welcomed by the incredible hosts, Sri and Bum Bum. Their kindness, friendliness, and eagerness to help made my stay truly unforgettable.

The hostel itself was impeccably clean and spacious, offering a comfortable atmosphere for relaxation and socializing. The highlight of the property was undoubtedly the swimming pool, which overlooked a picturesque rice field.

The hostel boasts a prime location, making it convenient to explore the surrounding area.

Don't hesitate to book a few nights in this hostel if your seeking for a peaceful stay.","Very friendly owners and helpful staff. We stayed for two nights. There were many backpackers during our stay, so it was easy to make friends. The landlady helped us book the Mt Batu sunrise climb and woke up at 2am to cook us breakfast. Highly recommend","Awesome hostel to stay at. Fun friendly vibes with nice jungle hut rooms. The pool was amazing and the location was great for waterfalls, temples and rice fields."

Food is amazing and view of the wild jungle really breathtaking! There is a duck living in the koi pond, super cute. The garden in the surrounding is nice to visit with all its terraces, temples, waterfalls and statues.","Sooo delicious!
We took noodle soup and noodles with teriyaki chicken and it tasted like heaven.
Also try fresh juices, especially orange one - you will be surprised 😉",Hidden gem. Certainly worth a visit. Very affordable and delicious food options.

This quaint resort, situated about 20-25 minutes outside of downtown Ubud, offers a delightful experience in traditional Balinese style.

The property features 8-10 well-maintained guest houses amidst beautifully landscaped surroundings. One of the highlights for me was enjoying the complimentary breakfast with a stunning cliffside view overlooking the lush forest and valley below.

The staff at Mirah Guest House were incredibly friendly and accommodating. They made arranging massages and other activities effortless, enhancing our overall stay.

If you're looking for a peaceful retreat away from the hustle of downtown Ubud, I highly recommend Mirah Guest House for its serene ambiance, attentive service, and great value. A truly memorable experience!",We stay here whenever we get up the mountain to escape the heat. It is such a beautiful and peaceful place.  It is small enough to be social and friendly yet you also have abundant privacy. Always a refreshing stay.,"Beautiful, peaceful place to stay. Room was very clean and had everything we needed. Food served in the restaurant is good quality, you can choose where you want to eat, we mostly ate on the terrace with a beautiful view. Garden and space outside our room was also very clean and well maintained, it was a pleasure to spend time there.","Are you going to maintain your a/c, or bacterial pneumonia is included as a free bonus for staying?

Rooms: poorly cleaned (a wet tissue in the last photo — after I wiped a bedside table) and there are indeed a few ants around;
there's a kettle, but no cups;
no hand soap in the bathroom.

Service: the concierge behaves ok, but smells like a old, unwashed gym t-shirt.

Location: ok.","Real jungle setting with super comfortable everything and animal-loving staff!

I always stay at Mirah Guesthouse when I am in the area. It is an extraordinarily calm, beautiful spot, the facilities are top notch,  with delightful decor and everything is very well maintained, and the staff are some of most kind and helpful I have found in Bali.

I am shocked to read the reviews complainning about the animals there, the EAGLE IS A RESCUE that they found in a horrible condition and have been nurturing it back to health!!!! I saw photos of the poor bird as it was when they found it- it's wings barely had any feathers left!!! Now the bird is thriving!

The small dog in the cage is very well cared for and given lots of love by everyone there, and IS NOT locked in its cage all day!!!

The only time the cage is locked is at night to protect the dog from jungle animals and prevent him from running into the street.

The little guy does not like being on a leash at all so his many daily walks are in full freedom and he often goes back to his cage himself once he is tuckered out.

Like all dogs, he is not allowed to run fully free all the time. take it easy with the panic folks!!

Best to ask people directly- find out what is going before making rash assumptions and harmful statements from behind your phone screen!!"

The resort also has a private access to nearby river that has a small waterfall, it's refreshing to walk down this path in the morning. A nice resort amidst the jungle indeed, it lives up to its name.
Service is pretty nice despite it being a little understaffed for such a big place. It's not perfect, but workers there tried their best to give you a very pleasant stay and it shows :) although the choice is quite limited, the food is pretty decent here & communication is easy through whatsapp.
Make sure you have a skilled driver with you because the access to this hidden gem is pretty challenging.",Lovely place! Highly recommend you to stay here! Guys at the front desk were extremely helpful and nice! Food was very tasty!,"The staff is incredibly polite and friendly. However, while the rooms are spacious, they have a significant mold issue. Our main concern was the kitchen; the food hygiene left much to be desired. We encountered numerous bugs in our meals. Even though our room came with breakfast included, we opted to dine at other restaurants. Overall, it was a unique experience.","Such a place for relaxing,in the middle of jungle. The place is very nice to stay along but the road to get there is challenging. Amazing to spent days in here.","I think I really regret booking this room. We booked 2 rooms at the last hour with the rain coming down, so many reptiles inside. We paid IDR 1 million with agoda discount for 2 rooms. There was no ac and when we checked in the receptionist seemed confused we booked 2 rooms. Then they gave us the remaining room. It was a bad experience, we regret😢"

I highly recommend The Nenggala Suite!","Best stay we have had on Bali.
Staff was great, place is a great hideout, absolutely amazing room. View from the room. And the are with pool. Simply amazing.
You can also rent a scooter (you might need one to get around)
Incredible, Terima kasih.","Had an amazing stay here for a week. Beautiful views from the upper floor and excellent service from staff. Be are aware it's a good 30 mins from Ubud and there's not much around in terms of restaurants and grab delivery. That being said, the food on site was great and they do provide a shuttle to town and back every day if you need it.

Excellent place to unplug or check out sebatu waterfall temple nearby."

The swimming pool has a swing, a small hydromassage tub, and a peaceful view of the rice fields.",Rooms here are big. And the staff here are so polite and humble. We stayed here for one night. Only the thing here is that dont eat food inside the room because insects will come and you will be not able to sleep at night. So dont eat food inside room. Rest i highly recommend stay here as its nearby swings and rice terrace. The nature of employees is too good.,Staff here is so nice. They deserve a medal for how nice they were to us and they granted us ever wish we asked for!,"Staying here in a lumbung type room. The room is spacious, clean, cool, have smart tv, and comfortable. The breakfast is well presented and tastes good. The hot water works well, though it's a bit weak if both the shower and bathtub are on at the same time. The pool is also clean with a nice view. The staff is friendly, and we got a welcome drink too.

The downside is that there were spiders, small cockroaches, and bed bugs (possibly due to being close to the rice fields). If you encounter these, you can ask the staff to help clean. At night, you can hear small squirrels jumping on the roof.

Overall, the accommodation is good, comfortable, with a very pleasant ambiance. Recommended."
