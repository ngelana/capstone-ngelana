We are here for our anniversary and they left us rose petals, swan towels and balloons decorations, and mini whole cake. which is lovely.

Loving the spa, although it‚Äôs a bit overpriced.
Really enjoyed the pool & the jacuzzi. At the pool bar we met Mr Wirawan, had a lovely chat with him and he gave us an excellent service. We also had a romantic dinner, with a jungle vibe, it was very lovely and the food was excellent!

But one minor annoyance was that smoking access is very difficult at this hotel. Smoking is not allowed in the bar, outdoor restaurant, even in our room outdoor balcony. So maybe it's a bit unsuitable for smokers who want to enjoy their holidays and be able to smoke leisurely.","Our recent trip was nothing short of magical, thanks to the meticulous attention to detail that went into every aspect of our stay. The breathtaking views and luxurious accommodations made for an unforgettable experience, one that we will treasure for years to come. A special thank you to the staff for their exceptional care and hospitality, going above and beyond to ensure that our every need was met. And a special mention to the adorable pink Teddy bear that our daughter received, which brought a big smile to her face and will be a cherished keepsake for years to come!","Good service

Service was excellent, reception very responsive to all our needs, which is really important when travelling with three young kids. Food was also excellent. Amazing breakfast with Balinese and international options, which rotate daily so we got to experience a lot of local dishes over the week we were here.
We have the villa, which was enough for our family. A king size bed plus a corner nook with a daybed enough for a couple small kids. The furnishings were very deluxe and our own plunge pool was great.

Communal facilities were also great, beautiful Infinity pool, gym and open air yoga studio overlooking the valley. Sky rooftop drinks lounge, and restaurant. Cute little temple too. Free shuttle bus to the main town four times a day was also handy.

Would highly recommend","We had a blast! Stayed in villa 8 for 4 nights. We got a free massage, and dinner included in our stay. You may need to ask about inclusions. It was a 4 night minimum for them. Highly recommend the cooking class! Comes with fresh coconut drinks and you learn so much about the food and culture.","Superb in every way. Staff are super friendly, helpful and kind. The spa was amazing and the place is constantly being cleaned and your requirements are always met in this hotel.

The pool did shut for maintenance for a week (they offered a shuttle to a nearby pool instead). This only impacted us for 1 day for our trip and we had our own private villa pool (recommended) so it didn‚Äôt even matter and maintenance isn‚Äôt even a bad thing!

Top marks","Far from airport...  But it doesn't matter! Room is nice and spacious. Breakfast is good. Most is Indian, Western and Indonesian food. The pool is big but not much things there. If your room is at level 1, you can easily get to the pool and the other villas.","Amazing place to stay, the service is wonderful.

We ordered chocolate milkshake but it was more like iced chocolate.
The pizza was bland and very weird to taste and felt like a home made pizza.
The rice bowl also didn't taste great.","Dome Caf√© is a lovely garden restaurant. The food actually comes from the restaurant next door, UNAME, which has upstairs seating, and they bring it to the daybeds and benches at Dome.
Definitely a good place to bring kids as they can explore the gardens and the eponymous Dome which is a small purple hut (with not much inside), but watch out for the edges as there is a steep drop to the river below.
Anyway the food and drinks are delicious, quality of ingredients is good and portion size is also very reasonable.
There's a plunge pool/jacuzzi, though nobody was using it when we visited.
You can also book this place for parties.",It has a nice ambience and the staff were really friendly and attentive. The food was tasty and we love how windy and peaceful it was. A great place to spend your Sunday üòÄ,"Beautiful Garden Setting,  friendly staff.

Enjoyable experience here, although the seating arrangements vary from beanbags to ground sitting and swings and benches best to try get a table and chair to enjoy dinner rather than a floor or beanbag.

The food portion was unfortunately small and priced like other restaurants where you would get more.

Beautiful location for a small meal and drinks for sunset.

Overall Enjoyable experience worth a visit while In the area."

Worth a visit if you are close by.","UNAME by Pranama is a hidden gem. It is located close to the main roads and still very peaceful with beautiful views. The kitchen is a fusion of tradition and modernity. The taste and presentation were at top level, it is a place to visit, when you yearn for an experience, but also just to have a fine plate of food.
