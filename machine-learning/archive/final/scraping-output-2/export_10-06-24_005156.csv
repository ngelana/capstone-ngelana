The staff were amazing with attentive and friendly service, some of the best I have received in Bali. The breakfast was good with a variety of options and barista made coffee. Location is a bit far from the main part of Ubud however the daily shuttle service makes it easy enough to get to the centre. Hotel also offers complimentary meditation and yoga sessions and a 10 min massage by the pool which is a nice addition. Beds were comfy with air conditioning that works well. Only fault was the room service often forgot to replenish items such as towels every day.","Our recent stay at Garcia Ubud was a serene escape from the hustle and bustle, offering a peaceful retreat nestled in nature's embrace. The picturesque surroundings and calming ambiance made it an ideal choice for those seeking tranquility. I am not sure how do they calculate STARS but it is certainly not a 5 Star property it's more of a 4 or 4.5 star by the size of the property.

From the moment we arrived, the hotel's stunning location captivated us. Surrounded by lush greenery and offering breathtaking views. The rooms were tastefully decorated, and the comfortable furnishings added to the overall sense of calm.

However, I must mention a minor inconvenience during our stay—the shower screen in the bathroom was leaking. Although this was a small hiccup, it did not significantly impact the overall experience. I brought the issue to the attention of the staff, who were quick to respond and wrote my feedback.

Despite this minor maintenance concern, the hotel staff's commitment to guest satisfaction was eviden. The customer service exhibited by the staff during this situation was commendable, reinforcing the positive impression we had of Garcia.

In conclusion,Garcia is a hidden gem for those seeking a tranquil escape. While the shower panel issue was a minor setback, the serene surroundings, coupled with the attentive and responsive staff, make this hotel a memorable and peaceful retreat.",I stayed at Garcia Ubud for 4 nights. It is brand new hotel and very clean and tidy. Staff are kind and supportive. Breakfast is amazing. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family and come back next time. I will bring and remember all good memories from this hotel.,"Beautiful tucked away hotel. Encompassed by rice fields. It’s truly a breath of fresh air. Rooms were lovely and spacious.

Service was excellent. Every single one of their Staff from the front desk to the room cleaners were knowledgable and friendly.

The downsides for me was Ubud in general. Everything is far and requires a taxi / moped. With driving general excursions take around 30-60 minutes to get to. Hotel does offer a shuttle to and from the monkey sanctuary in ubud which is nice.

Secondly the restaurant is really overpriced however you can be satisfied that the food is clean and safe to eat. Flavours were quite bland and ended up ordering food online to the room quite often as that was cheaper than a meal for one at the hotel.

The breakfast was lovely, fresh baked goods which you choice of main and smoothies. The Indonesia fried rice was a lovely meal to start the day with. Portions did come across small to me, but I soon realised I was a greedy pig and didn’t need that much food. They have the right amount ! And it was great!

Another thing, not a fault to the hotel however walls were quite thin and heard someone getting it on….for two mins twice! There was also random screaming at night from guests which security did sort out quickly.

Overall my stay was great and I can only thank the staff at the hotel for making it the experience it was. Ps glass mineral bottles are provided daily to brush teeth.","This is the worst hotel i tried in my life
Not clean and alot of bugs INSIDE the bed room with alot of geckos all over your head when you sleep so your never alone
Even if you order food it will come with some bugs
And when the house keeping chang you towels they will bring unclean ones with makeup!
If you want to sleep and relax you CANT because they dont understand the meaning of DO NOT DISTURB and they will call you every morning to ask if you need anything …. Well yes i just want not to be disturbed!!

If you like to be disturbed and sleep with bugs , geckos , frogs and eat them this is the perfect place because it’s impossible to fully close the door

The staff made it extraordinary! Especially Tari, my 10 day Healing Retreat organizer/hotel guru! Luxurious does not describe the attention to detail of this place! I don't think I will be able to stay anywhere else in Ubud. Pure class, warmth and kindness. This place is magical.","Our room was the best we have ever stayed in, top-notch, and the stunning swimming pool surrounded by tropical trees was truly breathtaking. The staff was incredibly helpful and always greeted us with smiles, going above and beyond to make our stay memorable. One particular instance stood out: when we had to leave early and missed breakfast, they kindly prepared a take-away breakfast for us before the scheduled time. This level of care and attention to detail made our stay unforgettable. If I were to single out an area for improvement, it would be the dining experience, which, while satisfactory, fell short of the exceptional standards set by the rest of the hotel. However, this minor point did not detract from our overall 10/10 experience at Nyuh hotel. Nyuh hotel is a gem in Ubud, Bali, and we cannot wait to return!","A poor experience. Definitely not a 5 star resort. Badly understaffed and determined to extract every dollar out of customers. Food was very average and made us ill (not to mention took over 90 minutes to arrive) - we ended up eating at the next door resort restaurant (apparently a 4 star resort but much nicer than Nyuh).
Accomodation presents nicely on instagram, but that’s where the luxury ends. A very uncommon experience in Bali where the hospitality was sub standard.","We just fell in love with this amazing resort!
It is the perfect place to spend the holidays in peace and relaxed. Full of facilities and services! Very clean and very well maintained!
What makes the resort even more special is the staff! Rah and everyone made feel us like home! I wish I knew all their names to thank them one by one.
We definitely come back","During check-out, it was discovered that one kimono was missing and they started questioning us and searching our luggages.  We only used the kimono once for photos in the bathtub with flowers, the next day there was cleaning during which it was taken away and no fresh one was delivered. You better watch your staff. Not a pleasant experience.

The hotel asked me to remove the review."

Lovely ambience & hospitality. A bit secluded which we loved, but not close to the market, so can be a bit out of the way for people who like to stay around the market area.
Decent food, Brilliant Spa and amazing team.

A gentle suggestion: May be can add a few dishes on the menu for the Vegans and Vegetarians. Also, a few board games to be played in the room.","This is possibly one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at! The rooms are exquisite and the service makes you feel like royalty. The spa they have in the hotel is also incredible, we had a 2.5hr massage and left so relaxed and refreshed.

So much is also included, we had breakfast which was fresh to order and as much as you like, we also got a complimentary 1hr massage which was great and prompted the additional massage.

It's a short shuttle bus ride from the city centre (provided by the hotel for free) but was just enough out of the way and quiet which was perfect as Ubud can be a little busy and full on

The rooms are out of this world, ours had a huge bath, open shower and huge bed.

I'd quite happily recommend this to anyone.","I cannot say enough great things about this hotel / resort. It's incredibly peaceful, green, beautiful and so very clean. The massages were perfect and the service simply impeccable. The food was delectable and we always looked forward to our breakfasts :-)  I have only the best things to say. We even booked out last 2 nights in Bali there - just to illustrate how much we so enjoyed our stay.","Honestly, wow! As people who travel frequently, we can vouch that this was one of the most wonderful places we’ve stayed. So authentic, a gorgeous, peaceful setting and the most friendly/kind staff you will ever meet.

We stayed in a deluxe suite which was amazing value with our own pool (would highly recommend). There was a great selection of food on offer at all mealtimes and as a vegetarian I never went hungry. Would suggest eating in Ubud a lot too though as it’s a great experience/lots of options.

The treatments at the spa were out of this world - wonderful couple’s massage and my skin has never felt better than after the facial.

Free yoga classes and lots of other things to get involved with (including Balinese offering making and rice field walks).

Due to the location being slightly outside of Ubud (which only helps make it more peaceful IMO), I would just recommend hiring one of their mopeds - just £5 a day including helmets. Such fun and the most efficient way to get around! But if not, they even offer a free shuttle bus to/from town :)","Very peaceful property body and mind both are relaxed , all staff of resort is so humble and ready to help you . Always suggest to everyone when you plan to be in Ubud Bali always choose this property to stay . Thanks to all reception staff especially swasti on reception desk ."

Very helpful and friendly staff. They also provide provided a nice birthday cake. Highly recommended :),"""The food was absolutely delicious and the service was top-notch. I will definitely be coming back to try more of their dishes!","Good breakfast here if you stay at The Garcia.

The food selection was good, got western and local options. The breakfast also comes with salad and pastries+jams.

Nasi goreng and mie goreng are both good!! It comes with some pickles and prawn crackers.

The service was also good but during the time we were there , the place was very full..also there is an option to have breakfast in the room (so the restaurant might be busier than it looks like when you are there).

The white peony tea was good. Highly recommend.

Sadly no decaf coffee, would love the hotel to consider offering decaf coffee !

They have oatmilk and other cow milk alternatives.

Oh and honorable mention goes for their salad. They have a very delicious salad dressing. They have their own version of balsamic vinegar. It was super good.

The seating area included indoor and outdoor areas. If you come early in the morning we recommend that you sit outdoors. No mosquito/ insect when we were there.","Unfortunately the food does not live up to the 5 star hotel rating. The service from the waitress was good but I wouldn’t go back to eat. We both ordered the chicken satay and it was very underwhelming. The chicken had merely been glazed with sauce, there was no deep flavour. And the sauce wasn’t very thick or rich. The green beans were withered and dry. The rice cakes were glutinous and not appetizing. Iceberg lettuce in the salad? Too expensive for what it is.","World class cuisine, very affordable for what you get in terms of breathtaking design of the restaurant, wonderful staff and most importantly, absolutely delicious perfect food. The whole food presentation is Michelin level restaurant. We were so delighted that we came back again second day for dinner despite the many options of Ubud. Great choice for people who do not stay in the hotel to visit this amazing place. We were lucky to stay in the hotel and the breakfasts were really delightful. Thank you!"

We were so lucky! 😁","The best option in Bali. Clean, best service, good food, good views, great pool. The suite was incredibly clean (Balinese people are very clean, from the richest to the poorest) and bug free. I don't know how they do to keep the insects away but they certainly do. The hot water is really hot and never gets interrupted, and the same with electricity. You have a fridge, a water heater, kitchenware and all you need to be comfortable. Includes a huge TV with international channels and audio system. The bed is very comfortable and big. Room service and staff were respectful and friendly at all times, trying to keep us happy. They offer a free shuttle to Ubud centre. Location is very good, as Bali has a big transportation problem and as Ubud is in the centre of the island you can ""easily"" reach everywhere  by hiring a driver or renting a motorbike.

No cons. If I have to mention something, maybe a microwave in the room would be good (I like drinking hot milk or chocolate at night). Just that.","Amazing place and staff. Very cosy and comfy room with great view. Staff very helpful, they even gave us umbrellas when it was raining and ordered the food with delivery for us when we wanted to:) we travelled to few places around Bali but this one was definitely the nicest stay we’ve had. Distance from Ubud may be quite problematic (as all the taxi drivers from Ubud want to rip you off and charge IDR200.000 for 4-5km trip (with no traffic jam)). But place by itself was amazing","The place has a lovely atmosphere, beautiful and clean rooms, it's located in a quiet area far from the noise and also it has a beautiful garden & pool. The people are very kind and helpful!

We can really recommend this place and for sure when we will return to Bali we will come back to Umah D Ubud!",Great and peaceful hotel.

Karaoke bar nearby is loud starting from the morning till late night. Also local people come to water under balcony to swim and laundry. They waked up us every morning. Location is good, close to Ubud and also close to South roads. A lot of flies cause garbage is not collected (they put it behind the fence). Air conditioning smells badly (asked to clean it for our money, but owner didn't do it). Drain holes in bathroom also smells bad, we used chemicals to solve this problem.","Best affordable villa in ubud, new, clean, big territory villa with garden,view and private entrance.",,,
