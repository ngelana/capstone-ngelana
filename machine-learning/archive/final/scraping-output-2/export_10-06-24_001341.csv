Contemplated checking out without refund because it‚Äôs that bad‚Ä¶dirty sheets, dirty floors inside bubble, Wish I could give zero stars‚Ä¶the staff was very lazy/rude and nonchalant did not try to accommodate us. The location is terrible a lot of drivers can‚Äôt find it. The staff roam around your room without warning which made me feel like they were Spying peeping on us. And they don‚Äôt assist with large luggage because they are lazy. They lie about prices and their food prices an extremely high compared to other places. And they try to get more money out of u by charging crazy extra amounts on items. Cool experience but would NEVER go back to them","Worst and over hyped stay. First of all the location is not good. The staff is not friendly.
My bed was filled with ants and when we complained they replied
""It is common sense that you will get ants here"".
The Bed should have been clean
I had my booking for 2 days but checked out without refund in 3 hours due to its ants and vibe.

If you don't want to be scammed like I was first check property physically then only pay.

Guys not at all recommended.üôè","This was a truly out of the world glamping experience for a first timer like me. The way the bubble is made, the way the bubble has all amenities in it even with such little space. The thought behind giving so much within that tiny space. Also the layout of the pool the day bed the suspended hammock and the swing are so perfect. Loved our stay. It was as close as you could get to nature.",This is a great place to stay for one night and I‚Äôm certainly glad we did it as the experience was enjoyable and the marshmallows over the fire was something I haven‚Äôt done since I was a young boy so it was very nostalgic. The only real issue I have is that the lack of food and beverage options were not highlighted prior to arrival as I was expecting to be able to book a bbq but was told that wasn‚Äôt an option as I had to give them notice (this wasn‚Äôt possible as it was a last minute booking and nobody informed me). Overall it was decent but please be aware it‚Äôs extremely remote and there are very limited options for food and beverage on site unless you like to eat junk food which isn‚Äôt something that appeals to me.,"Nice and interesting hotel, I liked everything!"

The staff is really friendly and nice. 2 nights is the perfect length of the stay as the property is pretty isolated. There were lots of insects but it is normal considering you are in the middle of the jungle. Upstairs is really good isolated, we didn‚Äôt have any insect / animal in the room. Totally recommend this place for a short romantic getaway.",Beautiful architecture and friendly staff. The room itself is very cosy. We didn‚Äôt have many insects even though the whole open space design. Love the in room dining experience and amazing rice field around. Thank you for sharing this beautiful house!,"This was my absolute dream place in Bali. I‚Äôd dreamt of staying in a bamboo place since I can remember. And umatreehouse was stunning in every way. However, if you do not like wild creatures living with you. This is not the place for you. I want to support the owners of Umatreehouse because they are local Balinese, however, I have to also be honest. We had many wild visitors like frogs, bugs, and Gekos, etc. But only one that kept us up scared at night. I won‚Äôt disclose the creature. But it was not pleasant. And you won‚Äôt get money back if you experience wildlife visitors.

When I booked this all I was thinking is is omg how stunning. AND IT WAS! And the staff was wonderful! And even came back after hours to TRY to help when we had our particular wildlife encounter. But I didn‚Äôt even put together that this place is completely exposed to the elements.

It was designed emaculately. And recently in 2024! But what could have made this place 10/10 would have been to enclose the entire downstairs. Not leave 6 inch spaces in all the corners of the walls for anything to come in.

I wish I could have enjoyed my time here more. But the wildlife visitor we had really made that difficult.","A great little hideaway for couples. Only stay here if you‚Äôre happy to share with the local wildlife. We had Larry the lizard visiting on several occasions, had a frog in the bedroom and heard rustling in the night that woke my wife. All in all worth the experience of staying in a treehouse!","We had a very pleasant time. Service at the level of expensive hotels.
I was very pleasantly surprised by the beauty and privacy of this villa.
Everything is very new and well designed, as if the villa was built a month ago. There is a portable gas stove and refrigerator.
Service and maintenance was at the highest level. Be sure to order a romantic dinner and breakfast to the pool!
Will definitely come back again."

This could manifest in a number of different ways in a physical space, such as a building or city. For example, a lack of clear signage or wayfinding could make it difficult to navigate a space and understand where things are located. A lack of consistency in architectural styles or design elements could make a space seem disjointed or chaotic. A lack of maintenance or upkeep could contribute to a feeling of disarray and neglect.

Incoherence in a social or cultural context could also be a factor. For example, if a community or organization lacks clear goals or values, it may be difficult to understand what it stands for or what it is trying to achieve. A lack of clear communication or consistent messaging could contribute to confusion or misunderstandings.

In general, a sense of coherence is important for creating a sense of order and understanding in a space or community. It can make it easier to navigate, understand, and engage with a place or group of people. When coherence is lacking, it can create confusion, frustration, and a sense of disconnection.

In conclusion, an incoherent place can be challenging to navigate and understand. Factors such as a lack of organization, clarity, or cohesion can contribute to a feeling of chaos or confusion. Creating a sense of coherence is important for promoting understanding and engagement in a physical or social context.",,,,
