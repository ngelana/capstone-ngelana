ChIJgxNvhqEX0i0R-6U9ogQJ_-k,Suwat Waterfall,-8.4876645,115.31786439999999,"Jl. Pura Dalem No.Desa, Suwat, Kec. Gianyar, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80511, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=16861205445404894715,OPERATIONAL,+62 857-3904-6295,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.5,1314,,"Suwat Waterfall may not be the best option if you have a strong desire to explore a grand waterfall. It is not known for its size and it appears that many people visit primarily to capture picturesque moments. The cost of entry for adults is 25k, and it is conveniently located just a brief 5-minute stroll from the parking lot. While I was there, I noticed some construction work taking place nearby. Nevertheless, I must admit that the ambiance of the surroundings is truly captivating and exudes a remarkable sense of tranquility.","After you park your scooter ( or grab) you have to pay the entrance fee and walk around 2 min down by the stairs. Easy access, great views. There was also a store to buy drinks. You can really chill as thereâ€™s no space , you come here to have a swim, jump from the rock and carry on hunting waterfalls!","Overpriced at 40K entrance fee vs. 20K of other waterfalls. Also very underwhelming. There was a lot of construction, and the waterfall itself was only OK. Would prioritize other waterfalls over this one.","The Suwat waterfall is Bali's most Instagrammable feature. Overhyped waterfall with minimal purpose. Nothing more than a tiny lake tucked away inside that's ideal for clif jumping. There aren't many people around here either. Not recommended at all; there are plenty of other, larger, cleaner waterfalls nearby.","If you're truly keen on visiting a waterfall, Suwat Waterfall might not be the ideal choice. It's not particularly large, and it seems most visitors come solely for photo opportunities. The entrance fee for adults is 25k, and it's just a short 5-minute walk from the parking area. During my visit, there was some ongoing construction nearby. However, I must say, the surroundings are enchanting and incredibly serene."
