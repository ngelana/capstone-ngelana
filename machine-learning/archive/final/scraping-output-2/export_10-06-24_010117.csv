ChIJnf1q5BEV0i0RcoIHcCiplnM,villa Le jardin de Bali Abian Saba,-8.611562,115.31338099999999,"Unnamed Rd,, Saba, Blahbatuh, Gianyar Regency, Bali, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=8329030552011637362,OPERATIONAL,+62 878-3870-9828,guest_house,"guest_house, lodging",4.4,55,,"we stayed at this villa for total 2 nights. it‚Äôs very worth it! taking into consideration prices, location, and the villa itself! this villa is so unique as it‚Äôs entirely built with woods and located in the middle of everywhere (25 minutes drive to ubud, 15 minutes drive to denpasar). staffs are also very friendly and welcoming. Recommended!","Stayed for a few nights. Very nice place, very quiet, away from traffic, city, and pollutants. The view is beautiful, overlooking hills and fields. The air is very fresh, light, and breezy. Very family friendly and a great 'healing' place. Not very far from Denpasar. Would love to go back and stay here üëçüèº","Such a good villa for enjoy your time with your lovely one, good facilities and ambience, and also good staff","Beautiful place. 4-5 rooms with a gorgeous pool overlooking breathtaking greenery. Massage therapist comes to the villa upon request. That was a great massage. Breakfast was included and delicious. Only drawbacks: (1) there's one restaurant that will deliver lunch and dinner (their food is okay, but can be tough for people with allergies, my husband has celiac- there is a kitchen you can cook your own food if you go shopping), (2) the hot water heater must have been incredibly small because I never got a hot shower, and (3) huge ants in the bathroom crawling on the toilet seat made it creepy to go to the bathroom. Otherwise, friendly staff and beautiful location.","A great little find via airbnb. It is secluded and it is about an hour away from the airport located a bit further from sanur and a 20 minute ride to ubud. To get around it is best to have a scooter which the owner or caretaker can arrange it for you. The nearest convenience store via bike is just 5 minutes away. The villa is great with a peaceful looking via over the river and rice fields. The infinity pool is a great plus as well as the breakfast they serve is top notch. The room is great all the amenities as you need is there as per being in a hotel kind of standard, the only thing lacking here is a bath tub and cable tv as well as the door lock is a bit hard to lock but it's worth it over the pool and as well as planned activities. You can call in a messuse as there is a massage table available beside the pool as well as ordering food from two nearby restaurants overall really a great find and I highly recommend it cheers

Tldr: good find, secluded, breakfast and a great stay"
