The park is in total privacy, rooms are beautiful and large, surrounded with green nature, sound of river and you are 10 minutes on feet from a beautiful waterfall. The food is wonderful, breakfasts were the best I ever had. I spent 2 weeks in the park to recharge and it was one of the best experiences here in Bali I got so far. I would love to thank from my heart all the wonderful staff for their kindness, care and friendliness! I will be coming back. And you go experience the heaven on Earth :)

Living in the mid of jungle, sound of river flowing, birds chirping, waterfall and good meal were orchestrated to recharge my energy. I so love the concept of this glamping to keep all the nature component are intact as it is.  One day I have to visit this place once again.","Great location, beautiful view, really nice experience.
The rooms are nicely decorated. I read other comments about smelly rooms, but we didn‚Äôt get that.
It get‚Äôs cold at night, so bring a sweater.

The restaurant looks nice, lunch was good, the bbq for dinner was fun. They could improve the service. Staff didn‚Äôt want to bring food down to the river where they have the picknick places. There was only 1 beer with lunch left. Apart from Arak cocktails they don‚Äôt have other alcoholic options. I told them that we were also going to have dinner, suggesting that maybe someone could get some drinks. Although there was a lot of staff, and it was not very busy, this didn‚Äôt happen. So for dinner we had tea. We wanted to have another tea at 19:40h but because the restaurant closes at 20:00h they cleaned the machine (without a notice) and we couldn‚Äôt get tea (or coffee) after dinner.
The breakfast was ok, not great. The bread was old and other than american breakfast, nasi or mi, no other options. So they could improve on that.  They have good cappuccino‚Äôs but with breakfast only black coffee is included.

Overall I would recommend this place!","First the road to the camp is a bit steep, if you are just learning how to drive a bike  better to take a taxi. The road is well maintained and no bad roads at all.

The hotel is in a really good location, the food is also quiet nice, the spring rolls is a no but the banana fried and coffee can be a good option during rainy day.

Now let's talking about the room,
The room is moldy (I use the tent by the river)
You can smell a very strong mold here, but don't worry the staff sprayed  a lot of fragrance on the linen trying to cover the smell.  But sorry isn't working.

But Hey! It's Glamping right?
People need to understand also that this is a better version from a conventional camping ground. Don't expect hotel room, then I think we will have a better POV for this place.

The Bathroom is very clean, well maintained, they have warm water. They only they need to move the bee hive from the bathroom, I am scared that a tall human can unintentionally disturbing the bees as it's in front of the bathroom door.

Good Experience? Yes
Worth the money? Yes

It's by the river and they only charge you 550K go for it :)

Your kids will love it here","I booked the super deluxe glamping for 2 nights. When I arrived the first night, the smell in the tent and toilet was pretty bad, a mixed between pee and dampness and mold. I had read a few reviews commenting about this but I thought they were exaggerating. They use perfume sachets which makes the smell strong. The next morning I told them and they moved me to another tent were the smell was better. Agus was helpful moving me to a different tent and tried his best. The manager offered me a refund of that first night and explained they are working to improve this.

If you are Gluten free, no gluten free bread or alternatives be aware of that. Only the ones that came without gluten already just as rice, eggs, veggies... Food service takes time so consider ordering with plenty of time.

Nature around is awesome and wifi is good and fast. And staff is friendly"

However, the track is not easy. It takes 15-30 minutes to get there from a road. Not suitable for small children or elders. Don't go there if it's rainy!!!","Wonderfull waterfall, still fresh and clean. But the way in is a bit far.","Directions are incorrect. This is the same waterfall as ‚ÄúAuman‚Äù just up the road, where you can park and there‚Äôs a trail.","Even though Bali's cities are fun and very friendly, sometimes you want to leave the busy life behind and retreat to a place you can relax. This is a story about my first time visiting Batu lantang waterfall.

Early in the morning, 11'o clock AM, my friend and I are sitting at the cafe, discussing our next location in our two week Bali adventure. We want to go somewhere the locals go. Avoiding all the tourists that swamp the island during the European summer months. We decided we want to see a waterfall. So, where do you go? There are so many, and we just couldn't decide. So we decided fate would choose for us and just chose one we saw on the map. Batu Lantang. After a one hour journey on our rented scooters, we arrive at the site. The entrance isn't clearly marked. Just a simple sign pointing down a hill into the jungle. For a moment we doubted continuing but decided to follow the arrow pointing down.

A small track zigzags down. First, it's just a dirt path. Then it transforms into a small wall made of brick. On one side a small stream of water and the mountain wall, on the other side a very steep drop down into the jungle. You don't want to fall down here. It must be at least 50 meters down. That's 160 feet for you Americans.

The brick wall must be just 2 feet wide. We carefully place our feet while making sure we keep our balance. After 10 minutes walking carefully along the ledge and while the jungle kisses our feet with her leaves, we see a second arrow pointing us at the waterfall. At least we didn't get lost!

A third arrow comes into view.  It directs us through some high grass. Man, I wish I didn't choose my shorts for this trip. Carefully we continue through the tall grass when suddenly the grass starts moving. It shocked me, keep in mind Indonesia has snakes, and you don't want to get bitten by them. I almost lost my balance, then realizing it's a small cute salamander moving harmlessly through the grass. We probably scared it first.

We've come pretty far. And we must have been walking for a good 30 minutes already. Then the path changes. It disappears into a wall of loose dirt. We can barely cross it, using our fingers to grip the dirt and carefully crossing the loose sand. On the other side, there is another arrow pointing down that scary wall of dirt we just crossed. The path wraps around a tree and then we saw a rope. The rope is there to help you descend further down the mountain. About 5/7 meters down we arrive at the bottom.

At that point, we can clearly hear the waterfall roaring. We even hear some voices of children laughing and playing.

Continuing the path towards the sound we are greeted with an amazing sight. Out of nowhere, the waterfall appears. It is so beatiful we have to take a moment to take in its beauty. The next two hours are spent bathing and having fun with the local Indonesian children. They guided us through the water, marking the shallow spots you can easily cross. It was truly an amazing experience and one I'll never forget.","The waterfall is beautiful, just bit hard to reach this waterfall,"

The path is not maintained, not cleaned, and a  steps are littered with branches, leaves, and rotting fruit.  It is very sad that the money for entry does not go towards cleaning or improving the trail, but goes into the pockets of the guards.","Very nice place, not too crowded and still very beautiful ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞",Beautifull and quiet... ( maybe crowdy the week end).  Good coff√©e an delicious beignets... gorengan cinkon and pisang. The path trecking in the back near the river need to be cleaned...to many grasses .but its ok its the end of rainy season .,Goa Gong rebranded from Air Terjung Batu Lantang but the waterfall itself is still just as beautiful... It's just a shame it is no longer the lovely natural gem in the jungle but has been built up with stupid instaspots instead of just honouring the stunning natural surrounds. The path also actually used to be better when it was just a natural farmers path - the new cement pathway get very steep and slippery in spots - hati-hati!,"A nice little hidden gem. It takes about 10-15 minutes of walk (some parts with steep stairs) to reach the waterfall from car parking lot. Allocate enough time to reach there and back well enough before dark. Their path has little lamps.
And they have clean toilets there."
