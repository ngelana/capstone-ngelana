About 12km from Singaraja","This tourist spot is very good, beautiful scenery suitable for family vacations, the location is very close to my house, very large parking and there is a fishing pond, cheap entry tickets.","Great location between mountains and rice fields. Only 10k Rp entrance during weekdays. In weekend 15k Rp. 2k Rp for parking. One big deep pool for diving and a smaller kid pool. Good roads to the WaterPark. Avoid the weekend , could be very busy then. Best time : weekdays mornings.","the swimming pool looks nice but not big enough, avoid to go there on the week end because it's very busy and you can't swim because too many people.",Great place and not to crowded to take a swim with family's. For price ticket still affordable

I recently stayed at this guest house and had a delightful experience. The atmosphere was very nice, and the environment was serene and peaceful, perfect for those seeking tranquility and a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life.

Putu, the owner, was incredibly friendly and welcoming, making us feel right at home from the moment we arrived. His warm hospitality truly enhanced our stay.

One of the highlights was the beautiful garden and lush greenery surrounding the property. It created a refreshing and calming ambiance that we absolutely loved.

Overall, this guest house is a hidden gem for anyone looking to find serenity. I will definitely be coming back again. Highly recommended!","Pleasant stay...away from the bustling city and beaches, it was a breath of fresh air. The pure mountainous air of the quiet Silangjana village and scenic natural beauty, stay was awesome, peaceful and tranquil. Room was spotless with clean and fresh sheets, toilet was clean. Hospitality was top notch. Pak Putu and Bu Eka are superb hosts,  catered to all of our needs with warmth and love. Food were delicious. Will most definitely be back again.","The most beautiful place I have ever stayed. Putu and Buddah were incredible hosts and Putu made the most delicious Balinese food. Located in the middle of rice terraces and jungle this natural heaven was a perfect place to relax. Nothing but the sounds of nature to wake up to. I stayed in the treehouse and it was so lovely and comfortable. Buddah and Putu helped with scooter rental, a driver for the day (their nephew) and local recommendations. Incredible waterfalls near by and Lovina to swim with dolphins!!
I couldnâ€™t recommend this place enough. I hope to be back.",,
