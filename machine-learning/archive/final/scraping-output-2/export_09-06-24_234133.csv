The whole place is huge. We went there with a tour so we didn‚Äôt have time to stay a lot but if you come with time, you can rent a bike and go through the rice fields. They only grow red and black rice in these terraces, not the normal white one, and the plant is a little bit different. Very interesting experience","Absolutely beautiful place! So much more peaceful than famous Tegallalang. I highly recommend coming here for real and genuine rice field experience! Pictures don‚Äôt do it‚Äôs justice. We came late afternoon, closer to sunset and it was so quiet, only few people around. Definitely one of the highlights of our Bali trip.",A truly unique place. There are several marked trails with different length and difficulty... At the two entry/exit points there's people helping you nicely to find the right for your capabilities. We hit a day with rain... Or the rain hit us. Maybe that made the green paradise even nicer,"A few years ago, these rice terraces were off-the-beaten track but they are now a popular place to see some of the Balinese countryside. At the end of the rainy season, these rice terraces glow emerald green, making them a wonderful place for photography. There are well-labelled trails among the rice terraces which lead you to shrines, temples and viewpoints. Highly recommended.","Fantastic place! So much greenery, lots of good hiking trails, you can stay here for a long time enjoying the beautiful and tranquil scenery.
I also really enjoyed being surrounded by thousands of dragonflies. There also are lots of different butterflies, including really huge ones. You can see birds, lizards as well.
For those crazy about taking pictures at every step there are lots of photo opportunities. Lots of places to eat and drink."

It was a busy restaurant that seemed to be very popular with large groups, but we were able to get a lovely table with a fantastic view for two.

The food was nice and the portions were well sized too.

The food was also good but we ordered a la carte and the service was extremely slow. We understood that it was busy but we waited more than 15 minutes for the check and there wasn‚Äôt that crowded anymore. This is why we only left 4 stars,"Popular restaurant at Jatiluwih with a great view.  The atmosphere was great with the second floor dining area and a great view of the rice fields.  The food was OK not great.  My party ordered the fried chicken, Mahi Mahi, Soto Ayam and a few other dishes.  It was OK but nothing special.  The service was slow and not very polite.  I probably wouldn't return as it is only good because of the view.","Great views and food selection make this the perfect stop after exploring the rice fields üåæ

During our lunch visit, we had two options: buffet or √† la carte. We chose the more flexible option and enjoyed delicious nyat nyat fish (~ish name) and pizza from their fire oven next to the restaurant.

As for drinks, we were satisfied with our cocktails and also found a tempting selection of teas ü´ñ

Full points for the amazing fish, good prices (especially considering the area) and overall atmosphere üôå","Whilst staying at ""Village Above The Clouds"" We visited Jatiluwih Rice Terraces and found parking was difficult so we asked the parking officers here at Gong Restaraunt if we could use the restaraunt parking lot we would have coffee and cake after visiting the rice terraces. They obliged. The Coffee was excellent, the Bruschetta good and the Lemon cake enjoyable. Very reasonable prices also. The view over this area was amazing. We noticed they have a buffet also but too early for us. The staff friendly and helpful as well. Thanks again to an excellent team here.
One small comment your steps front and side a bit  difficult for us oldies. Any plans to fix would be really appreciated."

I Wayan Wiranata's Betutu Chicken red rice porridge was excellent, so was the rice ginger tea.  A match made in heaven if you asked.  It was just right portion for anyone who wanted to continue trekking in JatiLuwih rice paddy.
Although some suggested that:
1.  special request foods ought to be served first as they were needing some attentions
2.  the cut chilly should be separated from the porridge to catered such group.

Service is excellent.  We enjoyed the atmosphere very much.  A 30 minutes trekking was an icing on the cake.
Not to mention that we came here on 31 VW rides from Baturiti.  The staffs arranged those cars.

Again, we, Kosayu88, thanked Pak Wiranata and staffs for foods, supports and hospitality.  All the best.","A simple warung-style restaurant with a magnificent view. Many food selections, but their specialty is the Bubur Betutu Beras Merah which is amazing and delicious and unique cause the congee is made from red rice. Try also their Lak Lak made from red rice flour drizzled with sweet palm sugar. The price is insanely cheap! No wonder you'll see many cars/motors park outside this establishment."

The view from the hotel is stunning, over the UNESCO World Heritage Jatuliwih Rice Paddies, and all of the nearby restaurants and shops are within a minute or two's walk.","So yourself a favor and stay there for one or two nights.
- Clean, spacious, redone rooms with lots of light.
- View over the terraces - from your bed.
- Steps away from the trails.
- Near restaurants.

I felt good there. I would come back and work remotely from there if I wanted to escape the traffic of Ubud and take some fresh air on the trails.","Wow wow wow! Only stayed here for one night but wish I had done at least 2-3. Here‚Äôs my pros and cons (+ & -).

+ Rooms are newly redone. Nothing fancy but everything is clean and doesn‚Äôt look rundown.
+ Location is INCREDIBLE! Walking out onto the balcony (especially if you‚Äôre lucky enough to get the second floor) and see the Jatiluwih rice terraces at sunrise is an experience you‚Äôll never forget.
+ Service is ok. Again, nothing like a full service resort, so while there‚Äôs no pampering the minimal interactions I had with the staff there seemed good overall.

- Smell in the bathroom. The toilet and shower have a door to separate them from the rest of the room so at least you don‚Äôt have to smell it often, but like many places in Bali you cans smell the sewer in the toilet/shower area.
- Only a couple options for restaurants nearby so just note that if you don‚Äôt have a car/scooter that any stay longer than 3 days and you‚Äôll be repeating restaurants. Not necessarily the worst option though because Bhuana Agung is one of the better restaurants I‚Äôve been to in Bali.
- Few ants in the room but if you aren‚Äôt used to that yet you haven‚Äôt been in Bali long enough
- Internet speeds suck. Only 3-4mbps down and up
- Coffee maker/hot water setup could be improved

Overall this is a great place. It might look like a lot of cons but I just like to be thorough with my review and make sure no one is surprised upon arrival. Would recommend this place to a friend no problem.","Really enjoyed our stay, can‚Äôt fault the property or the staff. Best view of Jatiluwih rice terraces.

The room was large and clean, the bed was huge (at least a king size) and very comfortable. Nice hot shower.

We had a room on the second floor and the views of the rice terrace and mountains was incredible. Took my breath away.

Grateful for the kettle and tea/coffee in the room. Other properties we stayed at for the same price did not included this.

Staff were attentive and went the extra mile; loaning us umbrellas (we didn‚Äôt even ask), so we could walk to dinner in the rain.

There is clear, easy parking for cars and scooter outside the hotel. A few reviews mentioned there wasn‚Äôt, maybe this is new?!

A few things to note:
1. Entry to the Jatiluwih area is charged. You will pass the ticket office on the way to the hotel and will need to pay. Consider this if you have a driver dropping you off and collecting you, it will be charged twice.
2. There are only 2 restaurants that open late (after 6PM) for dinner. You can walk to both from the hotel, literally next door to the right and left.
3. The hotel is right nice to one of the entrances for the Jatiluwih rice terrace hikes. Just what we wanted.

We only stayed for 1 night but wished we had stayed longer.","Breathtaking views, but never again.

Some of the pros include helpful staff, clean room, beautiful view, warm shower, quiet area, comfy bed, & hypoallergenic sheets.

Some of the cons include no hairdryer, no fridge, air conditioner not cold at all although it was set 16¬∞C, the staff didn't wear any face mask, the staff also kept the change from the payment without my approval even right after I gave them some gratuities (so make sure to prepare small amounts of the Indonesian currency to pay for the stay; they didn't accept card!), there was a huge & noisy house lizard in the bedroom, there was a curfew for the WiFi (always was turned off since early morning, then finally was on again from around 9 AM), no room services, very bad location with a mossy staircase (only suitable for backpackers with light items), extremely impolite attitude from the owner because they locked me out from the back entrance although there was no sign of ‚Äúno entry‚Äù, and I also had to pay Jatiluwih entrance fee 2x for my driver who just dropped/picked me off/up."

One minor issue is the hot water was working only for 1st 10 minutes shower i think. But overall this place is the best for short stay to enjoy Jatiluwih. Thank you and keep up the good service.","This is the second time i came to this resto in hoping they have made an improvement in their food. This time i ordered margaritha pizza. It came with full of cheese but not even warm. I asked the waiter to reheat it and it came still the same. I guess they serve ready made pizza. Well, if you plan to eat here, my suggestion stick to balinese or indo food.","We booked for suite room, yet we found some stains on our bed cover and bed sheets. We got nice view from our terrace.
They have two gym stuff on the roof top. A very cool swimming pool. We also can use some bikes to explore jatiluwih area.","the location is super near the ricefields so it's good if you want to stroll around Jatiluwih. i  booked the hotel through traveloka for a night 2 days before, we got their deluxe room with no air conditioning just a fan, no TV (which i like) full breakfast set for 380k.

i checked in at 6pm and their staff who welcomed us was super friendly.

Parking Lot:
they have quite spacious parking lot so we don't have to park our car on the street.

Overall Room:
we got the second room nearest from the front office, just behind the pool (yes they have a small pool). i thought it will be freezing, but it's actually not, the fan for me is quite helpful, so i don't need to change room with aircon yet, it might be different for others though. they also don't have telephone inside, so if you need something, run to their front office.

Bed:
the bed is okay, but i think it needs to be changed soon (the bed is bouncy and a lil bit old). i found 1 bed lice, but nothing more, we search if there's more, but there's none, so I'm okay with that as we're already tired, so remember to check before it's too late!

Complimentary:
we got complimentary mineral water and coffee/tea, soap, toothbrush, and towel (nice quality).

Bathroom:
their bathroom is quite large and very clean, but slippery. I think they know it's slippery  so they put a matt on the shower floor to keep people from falling. the hot water is great, it became hot right away. the toilet is mix between Toto and American Standard, which is good.

Free bicycle ride:
in the morning, we woke up at 6am and we strolled around the ricefields with bicycles until 7.15am. (the room includes free bicycle ride!)

Breakfast:
we came back for breakfast. their breakfast start from 7am. it includes a cup of tea/bali coffee, a fruit platter (big portion and i personally think delicious, we got watermelon, papaya, and pineapple slices), and you can choose between bread and jam, eggs, pancake with banana/pineapple, fried noodle, or fried rice. we went for the fried noodle and fried rice, and we didn't regret it! But as you see there are many flies!! Can't complained because it's everywhere.

Wifi:
there's wifi connection, but not too fast, it's okay to open YouTube with 144 quality though. ask the receptionist for the username and password because they don't tell you right away.

Scenery:
Nice sunrise and ricefield view from second floor and in front of the pool. You can also have breakfast across the road as they have tables there too. We don't do it because for us it's already too hot (full sun shine)","Restaurant is  decent for the area, hotel is so so, they managed to ""lose"" our booking made 5 weeks in advance and over sold there rooms, we arrived with a big group and got 3 rooms instead of the expected 6 rooms, it was a mess to organize an other place to stay and we received absolutely no help from the hotel. The room we got were ok, very hot and humid (no AC and no fan provided) we had to sleep with the door opened to get fresh air and could hear the noise of the passing traffic during the night... Overall a very stressful experience. 2 stars instead of 1 because the food was ok and staff 'trying' to be helpful even though they couldn't reach the upper management..."
