It started as a humble street vendor and has since become a hidden gem that serves delicious nasi campur and soto.

Despite its simple menu, the flavors are amazing and the prices are reasonable. For less than 25 thousand rupiah, you can enjoy a portion of Nasi Campur with side dishes of meat, soto, and a refreshing glass of iced orange.

The side dish menu changes every day, but babi nyat nyat, soto, and the jerky ‚Äì these are my personal favorites.

One downside to this otherwise great experience is that the food ordering system can be disorganized. Be sure to repeat your order to avoid any misunderstandings with the waiters.","Balinese cuisine, suckling pig and pork soup so delicious..not too expensive, still in a very reasonable prices...must visit..very recommended
