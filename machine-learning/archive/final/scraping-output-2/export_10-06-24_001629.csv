It is a family run, beautiful spot in an unexpected location. The menu is varied with lots of delicious Bali classics and some more unusual options we haven't seen before. The people are so kind and it is very reasonable. You will not be disappointed if you visit!","It’s a hidden gem, also because you have to enter the tiny trail from the road and you can park there the scooter.
We ate here very very good and spent very little money.
I urge you to eat the black rice pudding dessert, it’s the best one in Bali!!",Hands down one of the best meal we had in Bali. Home cooked Balinese cuisine in a lovely home setting. Staff were very welcoming and I even get to plug some ripe passion fruits in their garden. It's definitely worth the trip from Ubud.,"Beautiful spot and amazing food. I went twice for dinner when I was staying near by. The girls working out front are so kind and attentive. The food was wonderful. And the juice and smoothie are so tasty as well. It’s such a relaxing spot to eat, right in a garden space. It’s clean and the food was very yummy and filling. Couldn’t recommend more.",Hidden gem in a small local area inbetween the ricefields!

The place is beautiful.
However, it smelled strongly of mold, and my wife began to exhibit allergic reactions and headaches.
The hotel manager was more focused on making excuses, saying that it was typical for the jungle.
We had just come from another hotel in the jungle without any mold issues.

We ordered room service, fish and chips. But it looked like something from a canteen, without any garnish, and it was not properly fried. 200,000 IDR for a disappointing meal.

We decided to go to the bar to see if a drink could improve our mood and the initial problems. We found out that there was happy hour until 6 pm. The problem was that the bar did not open until 6 pm.

Not a smile from the sparse staff, and with only two other guests, there was a gloomy atmosphere.

Dinner was unfortunately the same canteen quality as before, but with prices as if it were fine dining.

We stayed for one night and checked out the next morning, even though we had paid for two more nights. It was only then that we received an apology, but no discount for the extremely critical conditions.

We do not know how it is during the peak season, but in the off-season, it is far from a 5-star hotel. Only the price is.","Would be a five had the full services been available, or had we known before booking that they wouldn't.

The first thing to really note is that this hotel has some of the best staff in the world. They went above and beyond on a daily basis to not only make our stay extremely comfortable but also that our kids felt welcome and safe. Our two kids loved the staff. They also helped us with transport wherever we wanted to go and nothing was too much trouble.

The food was very nice but the facilities were quite limited while we were there. No lunch, pool bar closed, no tasting menu's etc It was just coming into season, and we weren't aware that the menu would be as limited as it was, and with young kids we were largely reliant on the hotel for dinner every single night and with the limitations it did get a little repetitive. So again, food was good but it would have been nice to know that it wold be limited upon booking.

Room was very nice, pool was excellent and housekeeping were excellent. It's next to rice fields and in the jungle so you have to expect a lot of insects and we had a Gecko in our roof, which we didn't mind at all but I know some people would. So just know that you're booking a hotel in the jungle. The views were absolutely outstanding and all the locals were friendly.

We used the hotel to take private tours and we really enjoyed this. It was informative, useful and really helpful for us. Just need to be aware that traffic is really bad so whole day trips will take a long time, the hotel offer full day trips to different parts of Bali and it will take that.","Although the manager asked us not to write a bad review, we feel compelled to share our experience. We lost several hundreds dollars and one precious day of our honeymoon, and instead endured a day and night with headaches, itchy throats, and noses. Consequently, we chose to leave the Keliki ""luxury"" lodge and booked a 4-star hotel that truly deserved a 5-star rating.

Upon our arrival at Keliki, I immediately sensed mold and identified indicators within two minutes. Due to my physical reaction, we requested another room. The initial response was dismissive: ""This is how it is to stay in the jungle,"" ""All the rooms are the same,"" and ""There’s nothing wrong."" This was despite the fact that our previous hotel, also located in the jungle, did not have these issues. When I showed the manager photos of the mold, she promptly sent staff to change the mosquito net and clean the clogged dehumidifier filter. I appreciate that the manager took our complaint seriously after seeing the photos.

Given that our booking was non-refundable, we decided to give it a chance, looking forward to the delicious food advertised by the hotel. Unfortunately, there was no staff present at the pool bar, so we ordered room service. The pictures we took speak for themselves. Although the manager herself served the food to our lodge, the trays were never collected and remained there the next morning. We had hoped for a better dining experience, but only the prices matched fine dining, not the quality. We were informed that there was no à la carte fine dining, only a three-course dinner or a romantic dinner setup available with one day's notice.

Waking up the next morning with severe headaches, we were offered a breakfast that was comparable to what you might expect at a gas station. We decided to check out early, prioritizing our honeymoon experience over the money lost. It’s important to note that the lodge felt understaffed, the food was incredibly bad, and overall, it felt more like a deserted place than a luxury lodge.","We (Family with two Kids) stayed at the Keliki Lodge for a week in August and it was just fabulous! Fantastic Villa with private pool surrounded just by nature. The staff was always super friendly and helpful. Good a la card breakfast and food in the restaurant. One of our daughters has several food intolerances and they always prepared special meals that suited her. Marie, the manager was very helpful with organizing our excursions. We did great things you can not find in the travel guides and also included fun things for the children. All the drivers/guides from the lodge who were taking us were very friendly and attentive and told us a lot about the people and culture of Bali. It was by far the best experience we had so far and definitely an unforgetable time!","Amazing and quiet place among the rice culture. Lodges are a pure wonder decorated with à lot of care. Waking up with a floating breakfast in your private pool and with a view on the jungle is a unique pleasure. The restaurant proposes high quality food at a fair price. Thanks à lot to Marie Françoise, Made and the overall team for their kind welcome. It was à delightfull experience to stay in this place and discover the numerous amazing place in the region."

The villa is absolutely beautiful witha very large deep free standing bathtub and seperate rain shower.

It felt so romantic and exclusive in such a beautiful setting, and the food was delicious and beautifully presented. They went to a lot of effort for each of the courses, especially as I am vegetarian. You have to book and pay a deposit at least 24 hours before. They had a good selection of wines, and option to choose from their wine cellar. Only negatives were they did run out of bintang for my husband part way through the meal which was a little surprising and the portions are on the small side and would be better if they were a little bigger. When paying 3.5m IDR on dinner for 6 courses you would expect to leave feeling full, which we didn’t. However overall it was lovely and felt such a special occasion.","One of the best restaurant experiences in the area of Ubud. I loved the Christmas design and the chandeliers. The staff is very professional and the dinner we had was exceptional - my red snapper was perfect, paired with delicious rice and grilled corn. Also loved their red velvet latte I came back a few times just for it.","The newborn place in small village in Ubud is name Keliki. It’s Le Gastronome by Keliki Luxury Lodge. When I came into it, it looked luxurious like its name. They used bamboo mostly in the construction of the restaurant. I liked the glass chandeliers that they installed making it more luxurious.

Downstairs, you would find the poll with some red daybeds. That color was very pleasing to the eye. They had an open kitchen that looked very neat, clean and well-arranged. The neat kitchen reflected the good food. It was true, they had very delicious food with homemade ingredients. The bakery, pastry, main courses and desserts were appetizing and very tasty. Coffee? actually, it was okay. I got true hospitality from their staff. They were excellent.","I would give 5 star if I wasn't a very difficult French person and super demanding on quality, taste, service and cheese.

But service was very nice. Crèpes are delicious and buttery, with very nice Marmelade. Well done. Cheese platter was not perfect but a tease, also there's always one cheese that's just not good. But the tartare was fresh. Overall bravo 4.5 tops. Help this place have more people as it deserves a try.",I think it just opened in April. The staffs will be so happy to see you and make you feel greatly appreciated. The foods are delicious with good range of menu plus the place is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing. Atmosphere was great for long talks!

Pay attention when you book the rooms, one of them has an outside bathroom so you have to get dressed in the night to go to the loo. It’s a bit further than the 15/20 drives described into the town.
Big problem, which isn’t their fault, loud dogs and a rooster that crows randomly from 11pm all night","I choose this Accomodation because of two main reasons: it is outside and away from ubud center and the warung had good recommendings.

The Warung is more a Restaurant with cheap prices in a beautiful garden. You also can have breakfast in the Warung and the food all in all was amazing: Every chosen course was perfekt!!!!
You also can rent a scooter with fair rates: it s the same rate if you rent it at a Station.
The hole family is very nice and kind! I got a very nice breakfast at the last day, before leaving, without asking. They helped me with petrol, when i forgot to refuel it, and everyone is very helpfull and friendly in general. The room includes Lots of space for clothes, has own space for sitting, an extra terrace, and a small kitchen.
I enjoyed my time a lot and Jafar brought me to my next place, also for a fair rate.
It s a short and nice Ride to Tagalalang and it s also easy to go to ubud Center, by scooter. But you have to know, you need a scooter, or car.

This villa has good internet, me and my wife often conducts call meetings and it's going smoothly. My wife loves to work from the kitchen because she can feel the breeze from the trees and hear the sound of the water rushing from the river that is close to the kitchen.
We walked several times in the morning or afternoon around the villa to get snacks at the stalls around the villa or enjoy the air and atmosphere around the villa. And on the way we met some friendly people.

I eat it frequently. Also, sometimes I don’t want rice and I ask for vegetables instead and they are great at understanding my needs and replacing things in my plate correctly. They are fast, the food is tasty and good price. I’ve ordered the noodles, wings, chicken with veggies and rice and they are all great. The noodles are my favorite but they are greasy, as any other Balinese food. I ask for scrambled egg instead of fried egg, but the noodles usually include the fried egg.","An authentic Balinese food, made by local chef. This is the way how you taste real bali flavor, it is located in the middle of Balinese compound house.
If you would like to try the true Balinese experience, come and try and you will know how beautiful it is !

Western food also available something like pasta",EAT HERE! The atmosphere is clean and happy. The staff is kind and clearly puts a lot of effort into the food and presentation! And the food is super delicious!! 🥰🙏🏼,"I have eaten here several times over the last week and will certainly continue to do so. The food is fresh, delicious and cooked/served to perfection. The menu presents traditional Balinese dishes with some western additions to suit most tastes at prices that will please everyone. Cold beer and a range of fresh drinks are also available.
The restaurant is located towards the rear of the family compound, don't be afraid to come straight in at the entrance near the street sign.
Highly recommended!","I was staying at a villa nearby and wanted some authentic Balinese food. Nini Warung had exactly what I wanted. I ordered the nasi campur and I loved the variety it offered. The dish allowed me to taste some of the most delicious Balinese dishes on one plate. By the end of my meal, I was fully satisfied.

In addition to the delicious food, the family that run the restaurant are very kind and friendly."
