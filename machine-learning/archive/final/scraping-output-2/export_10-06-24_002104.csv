We ate here all three days of of our stay in Alampura I don‚Äôt know what we would have done with them. Meals were perfect. Fresh. Perfect portions. Well presented. Conversations with them were helpful, insightful and simply a joy. If you are visiting this part of Bali for a day or even a week, this is the only place you want stay. Perfect advice on sights to see, with all the local tips and tricks you need to get around with ease.

To add to their hospitality, the views and pool are stunning. We hope everyone that knows us finds this place and enjoys it as much as we did.
-Paul & Courtney","Wonderful place in East Bali, away from the crowds. I was looking for somewhere to work remotely for a week, and I'm so pleased I found Kebun Impian. It felt like staying at a local's home, a very nice one at that with lovey gardens and a stunning beach location. The owners, Yanti and John, are fantastic, and together with their friendly family and staff made my stay very memorable. And yes, they cook delicious food!","John and Wayan made our visit to this area beyond special. The food was spectacular! By the far the best meals we ate in the area were cooked by Wayan. Such personal and thoughtful touches in meal preparation. We ate the majority of our meals with them. And looking back I wished I had eaten all my meals there during our stay.

The view is spectacular, looking over the black sand beach, hearing the waves, and breeze coming off the water was nothing short of magical. The property is like stepping into an enchanted garden.

What was the best part of the experience and is something that is rarely found in travel but I am always searching is the genuine hospitality and connection provided by John, Wayan and family. They treated us like family. They welcomed us into their property which is their home as well. They made us feel as if we were family and at home. They shared with us the history of Bali, and guided us on places to go and things to see that were specific to our interests and something we would not have found from all the cookie cutter tour packages. With over 20+ years hosting they have experience and knowledge unmatched. This is Bali! This place is the reason why we travel. I feel immense gratitude for having stumbled upon Kebun Impian.

Wayans cooking class is not to be missed. It‚Äôs the real deal!!!! She takes the attendees to local markets to shop for fresh and local ingredients prior to rolling up our sleeves and chopping and cooking. Priceless experience!!!!

They are proprietors that understand what travelers need and provide a rich, fun, warm and authentic experience. I look forward to returning üôè",Sweet quiet place out of tourism with a great pool and wonderful view right next to the beach. Perfect for visiting some interesting temples in the east of Bali.,"Stopped for Lunch on our way to visit the Kings Palace , delighted we decided on this restaurant, unfortunately we were only staying for lunch but it looks like a lovely place to stay too...the pool, the garden leading onto the pool area and the sea views were amazing as was our lunch, the owner is obviously a very keen cook as she has her own Balinese Cookery book, some of the best fish we have had on our trip and loved the iced lemongrass and ginger tea..excellent service and warm hospitality we were even offered a dip in the beautiful pool..hopefully get a chance to return.."

Wayan is absolutely amazing as a chef and you should definitely have some food from her hands or try her cooking class. She is brilliant with flavours and I enjoyed her prawn and rice, the tofu pockets.
John is a wise conversationalist and I enjoyed discussing so many interesting topics with him.
Coming to the location - the location is absolutely crazy beautiful. I saw my best sunrise here. It is a perfect place for a solo evening with a book, painting, doing yoga or even having a candle light dinner.
The rooms are quite comfortable, clean and quite spacious.
What they do require is a good wifi connection throughout the property as my mobile data was not working due to some complications with my phone but if you have mobile data then it should work. Another addition should be charging points beside the bed on either side and longer curtains as the ones they had although of great fabric did not cover the entire window.
All in all, it is an absolutely gorgeous place with great company and I will recommend this place over and over.",We had the most amazing Balinese dinner here. Really tasty and friendly service. Would highly recommend.,"We had a great visit after going to the Water Palace , Taman Ujung.  We had such a nice visit with the owners and delicious food.  The kids had a swim in a lovely pool.  The view and and sound of the waves was paradise.  The company really made it so extra special.",".............Kebun Impian Something Unique..............
If on your way to or from Amed- Candidasa East Bali on the Ocean Road make a point of calling in here for a cold beer, a good coffee and some great local menu  choices & some Western options as well. You might even be lucky enough to share some stories with Yanti & John your most amicable hosts. Please make a point of buying her cook book 2 take home. Its a must.
We with our Jasri neighbours Ad & Brenda had a very long lunch. U will also with a refreshing swim perhaps. Oh they have a few rooms as well. Why not breakfast with them also?

Tell them Pak Jero sent you. Watch them laugh.",We stopped here for lunch after visiting the water temple.  John and Yanti were very kind and interesting to chat with.  The kids played in the pool while my wife and I soaked up the incredible view and sounds of waves crashing.  Yanti‚Äôs food was so tasty- the Pepes and Lalapan were exceptional.  Highly recommended.
