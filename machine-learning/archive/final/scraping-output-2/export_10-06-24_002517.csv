They need to have more staff especially to maintain the garden.","Everything was perfect! All of the staff are so friendly and accommodating!
The rooms are beautiful with an incredible view.
The view alone is worth 10 stars!

The kitchen and waitstaff are so accommodating for people with dietary restrictions and went above and beyond to make amazing vegan food off menu for us.

The pool is perfect and the inclinator / lift down to it makes it fun and novel!

I honestly couldn‚Äôt fault this place, I can‚Äôt understand the bad reviews!! Will absolutely be back!","1- The staff service is perfect, they are very friendly - thanks to all.

2- the location is great as its away from ubud but yet so close. The providing shuttle service to center.

3- the food is really nice good options to start up your day.

THE REASON I GIVE 3 stars:

1- the bed sheets cover was not clean.
2- the bed is noisy at night.
3- the room cleanness is not well maintained.
4- the towels has not great smells so get your‚Äôs.
5- bathroom smells bad at night ( 2nd day it was there ).
6- room service dont change the bed cover even after 3rd day.

The only location and pool forgive‚Äôs the hotel!!!","1. The staff service is incredible , they are very friendly and welcoming - thanks to all.

2. The locations is great as it is away from the city but yet so close, hiring a scooter was a wise choice we made.

3 the food was amzziinggggg at UME and the breakfast was great (especially presentation ) I love the concept of having al a carte.

4. The bed is extremely comfortable and a beautiful room.

5.  biggest let down which is why I am not rating 5 is we sent our clothes to get washed and they came back all dirty still and not washed and dredged, also under the bed and bathroom sink there is so much dust , housekeeping does not maintain the areas","Great experience in Ubud thanks to Horison Ume Ubud
Brand new property!. Stunning decor, view, and overall vibe! Restaurant and room service food was amazing! No one has a bad item. Very attentive staff. Spacious room with beautiful pool"

The staff is friendly and attentive, the breakfast was delicious and fresh every day and a few times we had dinner and also everything was perfect. The villa was spacious and clean and the infinity pool was perfect.

Oh and the food is amazing as well, particularly the beer rendang!","We stayed at the Luxury Superior Villa. We were given welcome fruits and drinks and even afternoon tea and cookies. The breakfast was included with our room and consisted of a fruit platter, breakfast of our choice (I chose American breakfast), croissant, muffin and bread plus juice and coffee. The butler prepared the table in the poolside as if we were fine dining. We also had floating breakfast in the private pool that has a spectacular jungle view. Dinner was also of superior quality. The villa provided one free drop off and pick up to the city centre  daily. They had halal food options which was convenient for us. The staff were helpful and friendly and serviced with a smile all throughout.","Best stay ever! Absolutely fabulous! Highly recommended!

This was the best accommodation we ever stayed in and we do like to travel!
The resort is in a peaceful location, set in the jungle and all you hear is the nearby river, bird songs and crickets.
We booked the Romantic Honeymoon Villa which is gorgeous.
You have an entire 2 storey villa with infinity pool, garden, seating area, outdoor bath, all just for yourself.
ALL staff (reception, chefs, room attendants, room service staff, spa therapists and Mr Rana, the Director) are incredible! They all are so friendly, polite and made us feel really special! Many thanks to all of them! They are amazing and are doing a brilliant job!
Their attention to detail is exceptional!
The entire place is spotless clean.
The food is absolutely delicious and is served in your villa, by the pool or on your terrace, whichever you prefer. The fluffy pancakes are a must!!! Thank you to the head chef and to chef Putu, especially.
If you reserve the bbq for dinner, you get a private chef who come and cooks the bbq at your villa.
For my wife birthday they organised a delicious birthday cake which was delivered at breakfast!
The resort also offers a free shuttle to Ubud center every day, on request. However, if you prefer to walk (1h 15 min to Ubud City centre) there is a footpath through beautiful rice fields, close to the resort.
Everything was stunning, we really enjoyed our stay and cannot wait to come back.
Bidadari Private Villas&Resort is a must stay and we highly recommend it!

Booked through Airbnb. 10/10 hospitality and the food is very tasty, I am very sad to leave!","Just awesome, everybody was soooo nice and helpful. I cannot describe how great we felt with my wife during our stay. Thank you üôè","Beautiful boutique hotel, great location, and the utmost welcoming staff you‚Äôll ever come across.

We found consistency in the welcoming nature of Indonesian hosts across the country during our Honeymoon, but Punia and his crew take the cake! Everything is easy with them. You can coordinate airport transfers, guided tours, and more. And, it never seemed like you were putting them out. They are pleased to make your stay as easy and enjoyable as can be. If you‚Äôre eyeing this for your Honeymoon, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book.

We stayed in the Honeymoon suite - it‚Äôs really the crown jewel of Alam Dania with its own plunge pool overlooking the rice terraces and jungle. There‚Äôs a beautiful communal pool as well, but we rarely saw people in it. As a matter of fact, we often felt like we had our own private boutique hotel (with two private pools!) even though the villas were full during our stay. This was a really nice place to feel like ‚Äòwe‚Äôve made it to Ubud.‚Äô The villa is very Hindu temple-like ... in fact, you wonder if you‚Äôre in the right place when you initially enter! But the second we arrived, the staff were there to take our bags and make us feel like we were at home.

Location-wise, we enjoyed that it was away from the hustle & bustle of the main part of Ubud. But, Ubud was easily accessible - no more than 20 min. away if it was during rush hour.

Punia and staff were so responsive. We never had issues getting a transfer to/from where we needed to be, we utilized laundry services, and we had a meal or two there (floating breakfast is fun!) where they bring food/drink directly to your villa.

5 stars all around.","its perfect  private pool villa for couple..Wide bathroom and  living room ..

I loved staying at Alam Danie Cottage. The villa was perfect for my stay, very comfortable, immaculately clean, and spacious. I loved a delicious breakfast being included in the price. The staff were so helpful and friendly and I only wish that I had stayed longer."

All in all, a very pleasant experience.","Amazing experience of our stay. Our room is light and airy with big space, the bathroom is beautiful.

At the same time, the view from the room is to the jungle, very quiet and peaceful. There is parking for bikes. Breakfast can be selected from the menu and the time of serving can be selected. The breakfasts are very tasty and varied, they were beautifully served on the balcony.

The house itself is nice and beautifully located on the edge of a hill with a serene rice field view which is astonishing to wake up to first thing in the morning.

It seems very peaceful at first, ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ but unfortunately, it was not the private vacation getaway I was looking for:

Too many times, someone showed up to our house ‚Äî without informing us beforehand ‚Ä¶

They either did some maintenance on the pool, the Wi-Fi (which suddenly stopped working like once a week), or other parts of the house.

This often felt like a violation of our privacy and made the stay very unpleasant. I didn‚Äòt feel like I could really relax and enjoy what the place has to offer as I was always concerned that someone could invade our space at any time ‚Ä¶

There is some other aspects that need to be improved. Such as the mold, the cleanliness (our bedsheets had stains and the bathroom was never cleaned), and the kitchen (not sufficient to do any cooking as it is barely equipped).

All in all, there were moments I truly enjoyed living here, and I definitely see how beautiful it could be, but it was also really annoying and disappointing ‚Äî the value for money was just really poor.","Had the pleasure to stay in Alus Cottage.

The outlook is gorgeous and there are lots of private spaces to sit and take it all in. The breakfasts each morning were really beautiful and we felt very taken care of. We joined in a yoga / meditation session (with Tibetan bowls) which was a highlight of our trip to Bali. Our hosts were very attentive to our needs and we are so grateful for their kindness to us. Worth noting that it's a little way out of Ubud town (which makes it so special). But you will need to arrange transport in and out of town to get meals as it's too far to walk. You can also get food delivered using the delivery service apps.

dewi and Maitreya are the ultimate hosts.  They arranged for a local driver, Jaya, to provide transportation to and from the airport as well as a day of local touring.

We tried almost every breakfast offering and were consistently blown away by the freshness, flavors, and presentation. In addition to breakfast, Dewi offered to share dinner with us one evening and the baked fish and fresh from her garden salad were fabulous! When discussing local food, Dewi offered her version of Tom Yum and took me to her beautiful kitchen for a taste! Delicious soup was delivered to us later that day. When I asked about groceries and restaurants, Maitreya guided me to GRAB which was such a gift ‚Äì we were able to remain in our lovely Hideaway and have all needs delivered!

Continuing the exceptional service, they set up massages in the shala for my husband and I. When out kids joined us a day later, another couple came to do their massages. We all agreed these were by far the best massages we had ever had!

As I didn't book the morning cooking class (where you go to the market), we went to the rice fields instead and I learned a lot about the rice harvesting.
Back at the warung, we prepared the paste and all the ingredients for a soup, the main dishes (e.g. for satay, curry, tempeh, Gado Gado) and a desert and started cooking by the stove and over the fire.
The cooking was a lot of fun because the whole family is just so sweet, kind and welcoming that it felt like being home. Really enjoyed my time here with ""my little Indonesian family"". And the food tasted insanely good. Not joking if I say it's one of the best dinners I had during my time in Bali. I also got all the recipes afterwards so I can  cook the dishes back home.
Highly recommend to book a class or come here for lunch or dinner if you're in Ubud.
Terima kasih!","We attended the cooking class here and it was the best experience. The family who run it are the nicest people and not only do you get to make 8 different dishes. You also get to see the local market, coffee plantation and learn a lot about the culture in Bali. I would highly recommend everyone to try this class.","One of my favourite Bali activities so far! Absolutely loved the whole day, being shown around the market followed by a group cooking class preparing the most delicious Indonesian cuisine. Goose (our host), Rakesh (chef) and Putu (instructor) made our day so special and taught us many things about Balinese culture and cuisine. The food was a 10/10","Amazing experience! One of the best activities we did in Bali. They pick you up in the morning, then go for a quick tour of the local market and time permitted a visit to a coffee plantation. The rest is dedicated to the cooking class and to the lunch. They were all very professional and nice. The atmosphere was very pleasant. Strongly recommended!","Oh man. What an experience. Wayan is the best. A lovely, humble and kind man who provided a fantastic service along with his family at their house. He really made the experience extra special.

The class was fun, dynamic and well-organised. The food (obviously the most important part) was delicious. I cannot wait to cook some recipes and maybe even open my own Balinese restaurant in Barcelona. If I do Wayan, you will be my first guest! Apples for dessert too ;)

Good luck with everything. Keep smiling, keep doing what you do best!

Wayan and his family went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and welcomed. The cottage is very spacey and really well decorated and equipped (the bathroom is amazing!) We were welcomed with a refreshing coconut ü•• which was so good after a long trip.
There are a lot of really good restaurants and Warungs around and Ubud is not far away (by gojek or grab).
We were very sad to leave the Aix Cottage and are sure that we will come back again!
Thank you Wayan!

We also booked a trip with Wayan‚Äòs Uncle Nyoman and had an amazing experience as well! Nyoman is very kind and welcoming. He explained a lot about the Bali culture and religion and also drove us wherever we wanted to go.We would highly recommend booking a trip with him! üå¥","I had an amazing stay at Aix Cottage Ubud! The wooden cabin added a special touch to the tranquil atmosphere. Wayan, the host, was incredibly welcoming and made my experience truly memorable. The cottage itself was charming and well-equipped.

If you are looking for a getaway from hustle and bustle of city and to disconnect from the routine errands of life, this is the perfect place! I have not come across many folks in hospitality  space who are as service oriented, accommodative, helpful, kind and ever smiling personality as Wayan(Aix). You‚Äôd feel right at home in his company and not to mention how lovely his entire family is! Food served were whole some, healthy and in generous portion! If you are looking for an authentic Balinese experience during your time in Ubud, this is the place to be! Last but certainly not the least, the bathroom at his cottage is easily the best I have seen in similar cottages! Aix, we are extremely grateful for your service, hospitality and kindness! You certainly made our stay in Bali a memorable one! Terima Kasih!üòäüôèüèª","This was by far the best experience I ever had when booking an apartment whether in Airbnb or any other platform.
Wayan (AIX) is such a nice host. His apartment has everything you need and the bathroom is truly insane. The garden is beautiful and the view into the jungle is like you would imagine.
Breakfast is cheap and delicious.
If you are looking for an apartment close to Ubud book Aix Cottage.

Ps: the drone picture shows the apartments. They are located at the palm-trees in the bottom. The rest you can see there is where his family lives."

They also provide tips for waterfalls etc if you need some ;) You can directly rent scooters from them, plan trips, get a driver, and laundry is close by. The food is also superb, and it‚Äôs great how you can choose between different breakfast options each day, so you can tap into different authentic Indonesian cuisine.

- clean bathroom (you have your private bathroom although Airbnb says ""shared"")
- great view (pool and directly at jungle)
- and last but not least: outstanding friendly and helpful host family!

The location is perfect! located around  15-20 mins 3,5 km from Ubud Center and takes around 50 mins / 26 km to Kintamani. It is easy to find especially when you're using Gmaps.

I stayed in two bedrooms villa, which located in the middle of two one bedroom villas. I and my family felt like home with warmth decoration and beautiful jungle scenery.

Communication with Pak Mangku was clear. He and his wife are super friendly, humble and helpful. The villa was prepared clean and tidy. No wonder, Pak Mangku received lots of five star reviews!

What's special about this place is the semi open/outdoor bathroom. You also can find The Ayu Laundry just across the Villa.
