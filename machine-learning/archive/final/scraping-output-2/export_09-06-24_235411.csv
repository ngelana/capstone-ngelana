Tampaksiring, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80552, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=5030624681891921582,OPERATIONAL,+62 813-3785-0619,,lodging,5,33,,"This place is INCREDIBLE!! We stayed here for two nights and it was so restorative. The host, Rahtut, and the other staff are welcoming and helpful and the views are absolutely stunning. Loved the beautiful infinity pool overflowing into the jungle! This spot is definitely a splurge compared to some others in Bali, but it was well worth it. Highly recommend.","I recently stayed at this amazing villa for two nights. Rahtut was such a welcoming, awesome host! Addressing anything we needed. He also took us to his coffee farm! That was a really nice surprise!

The villa is so cool! Itâ€™s like being in a treehouse! The breakfast was very tasty too!

Overall I seriously enjoyed my experience here and would love to return one day to experience the peace and quiet of the jungle!

Thanks Hidden Bamboo Bali! ðŸŒ´ðŸ™Œ","Pictures of this place don't do it justice. The guys who owned it looked after us sooooo well. They did us a floating breakfast on the last morning and even took us onto our next place.
The property was so secluded and the views went on for miles. I can't say enough good things about this stay.
I would definitely recommend this place if you're just looking to chill for a few days.","Just perfect! This place made Bali one of the most amazing vacations of our life. The location and views are stunning. The room itself is very well maintained with good lighting power, bluetooth speaker and wifi. The hosts are super friendly and we enjoyed all our meals here as well.

The only thing is to be aware that it's in the middle of a forest environment so bugs, snails and some other harmless creatures will often show up. But the beds have canopy protection and room is equipped with bug repellants.

Truly one of the most amazing and romantic stays to experience in Bali.","What a unique experience! You can see the love and attention to detail that went into building this bamboo house. Super private, surrounded by nature, clean, cozy. Definitely recommend!"

They are very friendly. They'll explain all about coffee making process. The view was great with tegalallang background. They also have many types of coffee. IT IS FREE.
I enjoyed my time while visiting this place. Highly recommend.","The coffee tasting would deserve fife stars, BUT.... Don't buy any of their coffee they sell! It's not what you tried before. It's more like overpriced instant coffee pouder. Very disappointing.","Well... if you look at this as a performing arts show they should get 5 stars

Wht you taste and what you buy the quality is very different.","More than 8-10 varieties, you can have samples too... Good",good place to try coffee
