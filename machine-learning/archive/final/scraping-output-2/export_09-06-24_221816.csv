Very clean with great rooms.
Delicious breakfast with a large selection of dishes which they all do well.
The grounds are very idyllic and the rooms are made fresh every day.
There is free drinking water, soap and fresh towels every day.
Best value for money you can find!!!",The owner Made was so lovely! For the price the rooms were clean and the location beautiful- surrounded by mountains and near to the beach and many sacred temples. Thank you Made!,"This place is an absolute gem! Everything was perfect, you can rent a scooter, enjoy the pool, or even order a massage, everything was really cheap, the host is absolutely adorable, breakfast was excellent, I can't recommend this place enough if you stop in Pemuteran (which you definitely should)","I loved the experience. You could choose from I believe 16 or more breakfast options included in the price for the room. I opted for the AC room for a little bit more cost, but it was totally worth it as the current weather on the coast was hot. The room is really spacious and the gardens are just beautiful (they have 2 , one with a petite pool). Friendliness is almost a given here in the North, true Balinese culture.","Unfortunately I have to give a bad review and maybe one day the owner starts caring about the poor dog that people keep mentioning in the reviews. I've seen many sad animal issues in Bali but if you want to have a business for people, how can you put a dog on a less than a meter leash in front of the entrance? It has no food or water, when we poured water into his broken bowl he drank everything he could before water spilled through the crack in it. He obviously has been beaten judging from his scared behaviour. This is just inhumane for me, I cannot do nothing seeing this. If people have no empathy for animals then maybe a bad review could speak to them?
Besides this, the place is not great at all, bedsheets had multiple stains on them, the so called superior room was no different from the budget ones. I booked it because it was supposed to have a bath but the 'bath' was so dirty it was too disgusting to use. Putting information that this is a four star hotel in the offer is a joke. People who give it 9 or 10 reviews haven't obviously seen better and cleaner places in Pemuteran, for the same price."

You have also access to the local well-equipped gym for free. You can put your stuff into the fridge and use anything from the kitchen, if necessary.

Wait for food was quite long, so do be prepared to wait.",Family owned resto ! Delicious food with a good variety ! Fetucini Prawn was my choice for the firist night and Spaghetti Davinci for the second ! Good satisfying meals !!!,"The grilled fish was equally impressive. The fish was perfectly grilled, with just the right amount of char and smoky flavor. The flesh was moist and flaky, and the seasoning was just right. I particularly enjoyed the crispy skin, which added a nice texture to the dish.

The fish soup was a perfect complement to the meal. The broth was rich and flavorful, with a subtle hint of fish flavor that was not overpowering. The soup was also packed with fresh vegetables, adding a nice crunch and texture to the dish.

Overall, I would highly recommend Ode Resto Pemuteran to anyone looking for delicious seafood dishes. The fish gratin and grilled fish with fish soup were outstanding, and I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu items. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also great, with a cozy and welcoming ambiance that made the dining experience even more enjoyable.","Great place with exceptional food and good service for a reasonable price.
