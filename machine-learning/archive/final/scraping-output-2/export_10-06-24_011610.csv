Tried to check with reception, she told they cant so anything and will only be able to help only in the day. Also, said they cant provide fan either! It's super hot in end of april and worst hotel ever.
Update: after complaining multiple times, they atleast tried to fix a.c and provided the fan.","Overall it was a comfortable stay. The wifi was decent and AC worked well. The location wasn‚Äôt the best as it seemed like a pretty residential area without much shops around. We had to take a bike if we wanted to go anywhere.

The major drawback was that the rooms were pretty run down looking and it wasn‚Äôt the cleanest. I found a dead cockroach on the floor under the vanity in the bedroom as soon as I checked in. There was another one in the kitchen cupboards. Ants would also come in as they please and I woke up with 7 bites on my ankle after the first night.",We did enjoy the privacy. A bit run down. Water pressure from the shower was great though. Pool was really dirty. We didn't use it because it was so dirty. I suppose you pay what you get.,"Enjoyed my stay here. Great private pool experience.

The surrounding was quite too. Staff was polite.

Not much choices for breakfast yet the fried rice ordered was tasty (comes with fruits and keropok).

Location is near the residential area. Mini mart are available in walking distance and you can also find some cafes and warung for food."
