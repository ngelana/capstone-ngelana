Bring your meals cause no one sells food or drinks here.",A beautiful local beach in Tabanan Regency. The distance from the main road to the beach is not far. Recommended to visit by motorbike rather than car as the access is still not hard asphalt.,"To see the cave and interesting mushroom rocks, you need to walk further to the left. Make sure to go there when the tide is low (you can google it), because water can be very high and you can be stranded there. Very quiet in the afternoon, only fishermen and some locals. Dark sands and rough sea, not really suitable for swimming.",Natural and not so organized beach. Narrow beach access. Surfing spot. Fisherman base. Very rocky beach (red rock spot). Many exotic spots. The cave is accessible close to the sunset time. Tide is high in the morning and afternoon. Only one warung available.,"Beautiful ricepaddy fields view on the road to this place. The beach seems not many people know, only few local people (fisherman). Nice place to explore, with its strong wave, rocky, and cave. Easier riding bike, but be careful as many trucks and big vehicle along the road. If you drive car, might will be in little traffic in some of junction."

Colin and  I have just spent three nights at The Cove with some of our family (nine altogether) from Australia to celebrate our son Henry's 50th birthday. A beautiful home and we all had a very comfortable stay. Terrific view of the ocean, pretty garden and lovely pool to swim in. Wayan cooked us delicious breakfasts and dinners. What ever we asked for she supplied, nice and fresh and tasty. Nothing was too much trouble for her. The birthday dinner was superb. All the staff were very pleasant and always helpful. Couldn't do more to help us. We didn't want to leave but all good things come to an end so they say. Hope we get back there one day. Thank you all.","This has to be the most beautiful property I've ever stayed at. We visited with a group of 13 to celebrate after a wedding in Indonesia. Rossella was incredibly responsive during the booking process an helped us with arrangements for our larger group. Chef Wayan was the best! They helped us create a menu for our big celebration dinner and had no problem fixing us up a quick dinner when we arrived late.

We highly recommend staying at the Cove!","A little far from denpasar, traffic could be bad too. Rooms are okay, not the best but service and especially the food are awesome.","We were in a group of 8 people for a week. The house is amazing and huge (including the pool house). Location a bit isolated if you need to go to a larger supermarket, but meh. Per the other comments the staff make this. Every day Wayan would ask what we wanted she would say her usual happy ""ok"" and it would just happen, including a birthday dinner. For the birthday, returning to the house the bath was full of flower petals and the bed was decorated, which was quite special, and did bring a tear to the eye of more than one of us. Pool is lovely and has shade from the trees. The ocean beach is a bit rough for kids to swim, but around the next beach is OK. The plastic on the shore is really upsetting and a wake-up to us all, but that is not the fault of The Cove. If you stay there, you will talk about it for years to come.","Amazing place! Here you can take the perfect vacation, with every comfort plus good privacy and peace. The staff is very nice and helpful, as well ad the cook. We'll never forget morning breakfast with fresh tropical fruits with the sound of sea waves in the background... and a White-bellied Sea Eagle soaring above us!"

If you want a quiet and beautiful place to relax and unwind with attentive staff at a reasonable price, this is it.  Lots of tree squirrels, birds and butterflies in the gardens, plus home cooked meals and lovely big breakfasts. Mr Kari also took us on a tour to the Butterfly Farm, Tea Plantation and UNESCO Rice Terraces for a very reasonable price. Clean and comfortable rooms and the pool was great too. Thank you to all the staff for a relaxing stay.","The perfect place to let go of any troubles or tensions with hardly any other one around you, neither at the villa nor at the beach, that is always viewable and just few steps away from your room. Mr. Kari and the staff at the villa were very nice and caring and made anything we could think of possible. The room by the pool was definitely our favorite, although every room has its charm. The manager, Mr Kari took us anywhere we wanted on the island.
Plus, he can get you a scooter to explore close by surf spots (advanced) just 10 min away or do an adventurous hike to the hidden waterfall with a local guide.

Peaceful and beautiful. The owners take pride in keeping everything clean and beautiful. The staff is super kind and helpful and Dewy is an amazing cook.  They have suggestions on activities, have drivers available to take you places and offer things like messages on the property with the ocean as the background. You feel like you are experiencing the real Bali.","This fantastic spot offers all the best of Bali.
I could not recommend John and Dewi's place enough and we hold them within the highest regard. We definitely intend on returning.
The first and lasting impression we got from this stay was that it was quiet and peaceful and a space of unspoilt natural beauty. We felt relaxed from the minute we came to stay. Around the Villa, you will find beautiful panoramic views of the scenic landscapes, where you are offered with the most beautiful of sunrises and sunsets, as well as clear nighttime skies. The pool overlooking the beach was amazing as you could watch the waves roll in with the tide from afar, or alternatively you could step down from the Villa to a private stretch of beach. There are a huge variety of birds and butterflies to enjoy on your trip and plenty of opportunities to birdwatch - including but not limited to the graceful Kingfisher. The facilities on-site are fantastic. There is a distinct focus on healthier options to support wellbeing, for example we were able to take part in yoga or massages. The hosts are really friendly and go above and beyond all expectations. The guest is their priority and they really try to make your stay as excellent as possible. Dewi offers the most amazing food and health drinks (with all local, organic, fresh and healthy ingredients) and John paid particular attention to detail when it came to other needs during our stay. Furthermore, the staff and housekeeping keep to an immaculate standard and are professionals. The areas on-site are very well-groomed and there is the most delightful botanical garden. The bedrooms are wonderful to sleep in, we have no complaints whatsoever, and the outdoors shower was reuniting with nature and very refreshing! Off-site all of your dreams can be realised with a designated driver. The driver we had was called Made and he was absolutely exceptional in all ways. He made every aspect of the holiday fantastic and provided ample advice for our trip and was much akin to a tour guide. We had ample things to do throughout our day and could shape the holiday to our desires with the help of our hosts and driver. All aspects of the stay were phemonimal and not once did we feel uncomfortable. Bali was absolutely surreal and the nature makes you feel like you've entered a new, enchanting world of true astonishment. We are so grateful to John, Dewi, Made, all of the staff, the two beautiful pomeranian pups... everyone involved contributed towards one of the most exhilarating holidays we've been on and we look forward to going back for more. Highly Recommended!",This place will become a 'home' in Bali for us. Everything was beyond our expectation!! Next time we just want to stay here longer. Staying 1 week wasn't enough!!! There are so much to discover around this place. And this was beautiful place with such a lovely host. Just a little paradise as it is. Definetly we will come again.,Most breathtaking views . Amazing host . Food food food . Did not want to leave . Will definitely be back soon . I have never been to a place in my life as peaceful as Sunset Dream Villas. Definitely do the treatments the ladies are the best . Thank you John and Dewi,"Words can not describe this place. But I'll try. When you go through that door you see... paradise. Stunning, breathtaking views, also from the room, beautiful place, big rooms, with fan/ aircon. Jean and Dewi are super hosts! Food is delicious. Massage @ their home is awesome too. If you need a place to relax and if you are looking for a tranquil place, just to do nothing or do some yoga, this is 1000% the place to stay. In the 35 years I have been travelling around the world, this one certainly is in my top lists!  Good vibes. Would definitely come again. Thank you Jean & Dewi. @ dewi Ps sorry I've missed you before we left!"
