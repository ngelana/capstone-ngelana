The taste, the spice, the portion, the price and last but not least the Balung soup is the best. Yes the place is not to comfort, especially if you come for lunch maybe need to wait to seated. I recommend using a motorcycle because it is located in the middle of the aisle.
Still the best for me.","If you're searching for the best babi guling in town, look no further than Babi Guling Pan Ana. My recent visit left me thoroughly impressed with their delicious offerings. I ordered the ""paket daging babi plus kulit,"" and it was an absolute delight.

The meat was perfectly cooked, tender, and bursting with flavor. The crispy pork skin was a standout, offering a satisfying crunch that complemented the succulent meat beautifully. Each bite was a testament to the care and expertise that goes into preparing this traditional Balinese dish.

Babi Guling Pan Ana truly lives up to its reputation. The flavors are top of the line, and the quality is evident in every component of the meal. Whether you're a local or a visitor, this is a must-try for any food enthusiast. Highly recommended!","While it might not be the top babi guling spot in town, the portions are generous. There's a variety of meat choices and the soup is tasty. The standout feature is the service ‚Äì during a crowded lunchtime visit, the staff went out of their way to find us a comfortable seat to wait. The price is reasonable, but due to its location in a small alley, parking can be a bit tricky. I'd suggest avoiding peak hours if you plan to visit.","My friend took me here as I'm not a local and it's kinda hidden from the main street so I wouldnt know about it if not for them. You can indeed never go wrong with pork, but it takes real skill of a cook to make the taste feel exceptional. This place is one of those. Just be careful if you decide to take away the ""lawar"" as it can be spoiled really quick","Tasty bigul with an affordable price. The soup is soooo good with a big chunk of meat inside. You must orded n pay first then give the note to the next counter, after that just find the seat. The food will be delivered to your table."

Last night, I had dinner at Marugame with friends, and what I like about Marugame is the friendly and kind staff. When it's crowded, it can be a bit confusing to find a seat, but luckily, there are plenty of tables and chairs available.

I usually order the Spicy Tori Paitan and dessert if they have it in stock. The prices are in the mid-range, not too cheap or expensive. You can also get free refills for your drinks, which is nice.

The restroom is basic; it's sometimes clean, and sometimes the floor can be a bit wet, depending on how frequently customers use it.

It's easy to access because it's located at the corner Simpang 6 Denpasar. The parking area is spacious for motorcycles, but not so much for cars, although the parking attendants are friendly.","Come there for lunch with my little family.

I never eat udon before and I little bit confuse about difference between Udon and Ramen. But the bigger size of noodle is Udon.

This place located in very good place and have a very big parking area. There are different place for non smoking, smoking, and indoor area. You can choose every menu in the kitchen bar or scan it before. My favourite one is unlimited Refill for Ocha if you order ocha. I love the place, very cozy.

We order 2 Udon and a Chicken Katsu and vegetable. I love the chicken katsu combined with tempura ketchup.","It does have a dedicated praying corner. I put 5 stars without hesitation for food, service and atmosphere because the foods are good, staffs are friendly, there is separated smoking area and sufficient parking.
if I may add its also easy to locate.","Really like the chicken katsu in this place, i recomended for udon menu. I suggest you to order ocha menu couse you can refill the drinks whenever you wanted to. Please come with empty stomach, because udon portion in this place was so big.

We will try a different bigul restaurant next time we visit Bali.","Wanted to eat some Babi Guling at night and came here after hearing some recommendations. Came here at about 8pm.

Honestly, I would like to come here again in the day because the pork has already been prepared, unlike the daytime ones where it is fresh out from the fire. The pork skin is not as crispy, and it's a little cold. Also, the pricing is a bit on the middle range.

I like how the dish is prepared as a small variety in a plate. There is an array of different ways the pork is prepared, and innards such as fried lung and intestine we're also given. Most of the items here are deep fried, or stir fried & grilled. My personal favourites on this plate were the pork cackling skin, pork skewers, and the sambal with the sweet potato leaves. The skewers were so good we ordered extra. I rate: 4/5 üåü

To pair with the dish, rice with another sambal is given, with a small piping small hot bowl of peppery pork soup.","The taste is not like before, pork skin is not crispy anymore at dinner time. Time to changed my preference of Bigul resto now","Little bit pricely compare with other place nearby.
Taste also almost the same with other.

For an allergic people like me, this kind of perfume is a torture to the nose.

The place is clean, spacious. It's a shame, but the service is not friendly. Maybe because the workload is too much. Hopefully it can be improved in the future. Other than that when I came, a lot of chicken was not available. Maybe in the future, before the chicken runs out it will be prepared faster.",Well the best 24hours fried chicken ever! The best menu is Geprek Chicken that cost 20k and 5k for the ice tea.. With only 25k I can enjoy free flow rice and I can refill my ice tea as many times as I want. Really affordable and the taste really good (to be compared with the price) CHEAP AND DELICIOUS! Good job!,"It's a crowded place, and there's always a queue every time I come here. Every time I come, there are never any chicken breast pieces available. Maybe it's so crowded that it sells well.","Great meal, great service even sometimes it takes a bit longer to get your orders in rush hour. The best part of this franchise is you can free flow the ice tea and pick up more rice as much as your tummy can handle!!","Good place to dine but those wibus community who order less than 100k is too loud!
The employees should grow a pair and tell them to be quiet, they really ruin my appetite."

They have authentic taste of southern Sulawesi dishes and I can recommend their mie goreng makassar and ayam goreng mentega, both are super delicious with generous portion, therefore you must bring friends to finish together.","Best fried rice I tried in Bali so far. The food are in generous amount and taste superb.  This place has also improved its place, the tables are more sturdy and rigid than my last visit, but unfortunately, the floor was very greasy. Overall, I would still come back if I miss the fried rice","Never disappointed having lunch and dinner here. The autenthic taste and spices, make the dishes is perfect. One of my favorite is Bihun Goreng Hokkian & Ayam Tanpa Tulang Saos Mentega!

Please bring your friend and family here. It's a good place to sharing with them.","Nice family restaurant, tasty food and big portion!!! I like the Nasi Goreng Makassar the most üß° will definitely back and try other menu","I can say they have the best Fried Rice in Bali! Generous portion as well. Also, try their Es Pisang Ijo. The spices were authentic. You can share one portion with 2-3 of your friend. Definitely worth the price and still not so many tourist know about this. Go give a try."

Sure its not 'all you can eat' but each serving of the meat selection is generous enough that even two serving of meat and a side of rice is enough to make you feel full (and not even close to being as expensive as a typical auce!). They also serve free kimchi and lettuce too which was tasty and were great accompaniments to the meal,"Charada is one of Korean BBQ optional to dine in Denpasar. But, the services is BAD.
The staff wasn't friendly or even smile to the customer.
We have to ask many times because they dont inform us clearly about the menu. Foremost, they don't repeat our order and when they served the food on the table, they just served and put those without explain which one is pork or beef or chicken.
Do they think that we know all the menus ?
Worst!

The beverage menus. A lot of their menus is unavailable. :(  Neither Soju

The food is Good and they have free kimchi ‚ú®‚ú® just the service is Bad üò°

Price range:
Food : 40k- 60k
Drinks : 5k - 20k üí∏üí∏","Best price for Korean BBQ lovers in Bali.  Good food,  Good choices and price are reasonable. Items are not so many like a big Korean restaurant but you get what you want most.
Service are quick and unlimited kimchi also vegetables
The problem only limited parking place in Jln Teuku umar a bustling area in denpasar .","Delicious korean food with budget. Price not expensive. Taste also good. Refill for kim chi and lettuce as your request. Full table at night and weekend, better make reservation or come earlier to get table. No car parking here. Only motorcycle, if you use car park at side of road.","The restaurant was a bit dim,and the gas pipe was visible and hazardous, the food was good and affordable, I ordered tea with longan fruit and the longan tasted like kimchi, probably it‚Äôs kept in a same fridge. Self serve condiments including the lettuce and kimchi. The exhaust is great so you‚Äôre leaving without the smell of grease on your shirt. Did I mention that they also sell frozen meats?"

I like the soup besides the tender large meatball, but no to the fritter. The place is packed and hot. They just take away leftovers without cleaning the table, so hygiene is a big problem here. Serving time is longer than average meatball diner. Good thing is the price, 15k for a meal is a bargain.","The staffs are very friendly, informative and helpful. This was our first time to try this Bakso Nuklir. Never expected before that it turned out to be a yummy experience. The broth is clear and delicious. The meatballs are tasty and they have various meatballs. One portion is served with noodles or vermicellies. They are similar to Bakso Boedjangan with their Taichan broth. When we asked for more vermicellies and broth only, they gave it for free! Thank you so much! Recommended place.",Good place to eat yummy Big Bakso/Meatball. Price is quiet cheap (around 10K per bowl). Will be back for sure!ü§ì #bebibuncit,"The super sapi broth is tasty enough without any additional sauces. Not to mention the meats.
