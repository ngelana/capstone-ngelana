We stayed in a jungle view room with a jacuzzi with our 1.5 year old son and it was perfect. The staff are beautiful and helpful. Buffet breakfast was plentiful. The grounds are large so we could wander around whenever we pleased. As someone who gets bitten a lot by mosquitoes, this time was no exception, just kept the doors closed to our room or the sheer shades drawn if the doors were open. Bring mosquito repellent!! We absolutely loved it","My wife and I were unfortunately disappointed with our experience staying at Visesa. We stayed there for 3 nights for our honeymoon, but it was marred by the poorly maintained villa we were given. However, the staff was very friendly, apologetic and prompt in rectifying the problems by moving us to another villa instead. Overall, it was definitely not the standard expected for the price we paid, $1800sgd.

Our villa was the infinity pool sky villa, villa 302, which looked great in the photos but was actually poorly maintained.

The first problem we spotted was the crack in the ceiling in front of the ac, which was dripping water. The next issue was the clogged shower drain, followed by the strong smell of sewage from the drain next to the toilet bowl, and lastly, the tap spout was missing so water started to pull at the base of the basin each time we used it. A smaller issue is the persistent presence of ants.

Fortunately, the staff was quick to address our issues and moved us to an adjacent villa, which did not have any of these major issues. However, we do have to state that the villa is showing its age and might be time to renovate the rooms.

In terms of the breakfast, it's just serviceable and generally not very tasty. But it's to be expected as not many hotels or villas in Indonesia are known for their breakfast buffet. The hotel pool is relatively small and quite close to the lobby and restaurant area, so not much privacy.

In terms of location, it's quite some distance away from the main area of Ubud so do rely on Grab or Gojek to get around. The hotel provides a shuttle bus service, but it's not frequent and the vehicle provided is exposed to the elements and not air-conditioned. If you're stucked in a jam, which is often in Ubud nowadays, then you'll be exposed to the noise, dirt and exhaust from the traffic.

Were it not for the service recovery by the staff and their friendly service, we would have rated Visesa 2 stars.","Had a wonderful experience at the resort
The staff is extremely kind and polite, goes out of their way to serve you. The food was amazing and the best thing is that they customise the food according to your preference.
Highly recommended for a peaceful stay with picturesque views and beautiful ambiance","Our family arrived at this beautiful and peaceful resort recently . We were so impressed by the polite and friendly hospitality. Both Panca and Suweta did their best to make our stay pleasant.
If you would like to experience nature at its best then VISESA is a must!",Beautiful property in the heart of nature with the most mind blowing view from your balcony and bath tub . Very friendly staff and if your looking for luxury & comfort it is the place to go .

We simply don't want to leave the place.
The weather is great, the aesthetics of the rooms and hotel are cozy and attractive.
Once we arrived we found the room decorated beautifully as they knew it was our honeymoon, and we ordered some pizza to the room and they gave us a heart shaped cake with it as an anniversary gift which was so sweet.","We loved our stay at the Udaya. It is such a beautiful property. We stayed in a Garden Suite, which was on ground level, and would highly recommend. There was jungle and a little stream filled with koi fish (which you could feed with food the resort provides!) right outside your door. The resort staff are also incredible. They are so pleasant and friendly, and willing to help you with anything you might need. They helped us arrange drivers, day trips, a flower bath in the room, laundry, etc. We enjoyed two Balinese massages at the Kaveri Spa which were also excellent, and joined one of the free morning yoga classes.

The shuttle into town is very convenient, or it is a cheap Grab ride away.

We went on to stay at two 5-star properties in other parts of Bali and the Udaya was our favourite!

Thanks very much to the Udaya staff for a wonderful stay!","We recently stayed here and had a wonderful time. The room was very nice with powerful AC which was much appreciated on the hot days.
The spa was absolutely amazing - we ended up booking another massage after the first because of how lovely it was. I also wanted to try the citrus bath but the spa was booked, however they kindly suggested doing it in the hotel room which was even better! I couldn’t believe they would come to my room to make up the bath.
The service throughout the entire hotel was so welcoming and kind. The location is also very close to the main area. Highly recommend.","This hotel was my partner and I 6th and last hotel of our two week Bali trip. We really liked the hotel and were very sad to leave. We would like to have stayed for a bit longer.
As a couple that leads a vegan diet they had options for breakfast which was great. They were always available to adjust their breakfast menu to make it vegan. We also enjoyed a few other meals for dinner and the food was always delicious.

The staff are nice and accommodating. The shuttle service to the main area of ubud is a nice touch although it was very unclear exactly where the pick up point is so I would advise that a specific reference point is provided to know where to be for return trips back to the hotel.

The pool area is lovely, basically in the middle of the jungle! We did struggle for sun beds though and feel that some more are needed.

The daily yoga on the rooftop is just great, we stayed 3 nights and one of us did the yoga every day!

As a suggestion we would like to recommend that during the night service lights should be left off and not on, especially the balcony one as if left on this will just attract more unnecessary mosquitoes.
There is also quite a lot of movement in the corridors early hours in the morning by the staff, which can be heard inside the rooms. Maybe this is something that could be looked at?

Despite the suggestions above we would definitely return and are likely to in the future.","Our second stay at Udaya Resorts. Always refreshing and memorable. Great service and hospitality. We love the rooms, garden, pool suite, hospitality, their welcome drink Udaya Fresh, free shuttle service to and from
Ubud centre (save on Grab and taxi troubles). Good menu for breakfast too. If not there are cafes nearby."

The rooms were spacious and clean and tidy. Toiletries, umbrella and hairdryer provided. We had a small balcony too.
There were lots of stairs to our room and our cases were carried for us by the team.
We used the free shuttle bus into town several times, but also walked once (which wouldn't be ideal with small children). Taxis were also readily available. In short, it was simple to travel to and from the hotel and Ubud.
The pool was clean and there was a pool bar which served drinks. We didn't use the spa service, and the gardens extended out a long way. It was truly beautiful. I would definitely return to this hotel, and recommend others to stay.","Sakti Garden Resort and Spa ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Room: The rooms are beautiful! Like something out of the Jungle Book! The rooms have beautiful Balinese architecture, decor, and artwork.

Service: The service from the staff is excellent. The staff was very attentive and were extremely helpful at all times.

Food: many great food options! From Indonesian, Indian, and European traditional breakfast options were offered for breakfast. Dinner was excellent and offered many great traditional Indonesian options as well as alternatives for those who were vegetarian or vegan.

Cleanliness: Resort staff was always cleaning around the clock whether it was the rooms and walkways to garden areas. The pool area was spotless free of any debris.

Overall: Next time we visit Ubud we will be staying here again. The value exceeded the price of our stay!","A very nicely laid out hotel. Nature was included in the concept and the huge windows give you the feeling of spending the night in the middle of the jungle.
The hotel is very clean, the grounds are fantastically maintained. Attention is paid to details.
All the employees are incredibly nice and attentive. We spent our son's birthday there and the breakfast table was very lovingly decorated.
We had a great time in Sakti Garden!","Super friendly and amazing staff.
Perfect facilities in a great tropical garden to enjoy your relaxing vacation. The rooms are spotless and will be cleaned twice a day. The location is great, in the beautiful landscape,  and very close to Ubud City Center - the hotel is providing a free shuttle service. The food and drinks at pool and restaurant are delicious especially the rich breakfast. Thank you, we will recommend our stay and will come back.","Great hotel, beautiful location, amazing rooms.

The resort is away from the main ubud central, but with the free shuttle running in the day and evening, it was easy to get to town. We can spend all day, few days in this resort without complaint. Will come back again!","Very good hotel, the service was impeccable! Just noticed a humidity smell on the room, maybe the manager needs to do something about with dehumidifier and good fragrance.  The room was beautiful,  the mattress good, everything was always clean. Also, they offered a tour guide which made all difference in our trip, Yudha! The guy is just INCREDIBLE! WE LOVED EVERYTHING!

A special experience, from the very spacious room, superlative cleanliness, a beautifully furnished balcony where you can drink your coffee quietly with a superb view.
Infinity pool where my daughter swam non-stop, pool bar, free shuttle bus to Ubud Palace, extraordinary food, and the prices were decent.
The exceptional staff, always with a smile on their faces and trying to fulfill all your wishes.
On the last day when we left, the manager offered us fried potatoes for our daughter and free coffee for us.
Certainly when we return to Bali, we will choose to stay at Adiwana Suweta again.🔝🔝","The staff was amazing, from the beginning to end. They helped with our bags, make sure we had a direct line of contact 24hr a day for any needs. They turned the room everytime we left, multiple times a day.

The room was large, and clean.","This place is wonderfully kept and staff is super friendly! We stayed there for 5 nights. Closer to city center and other attractions that you need to cover in Ubud. For me the most interesting part was the breakfast - they serve one main dish , one drink + choice of tea / coffee and bread basket with croissants till 11pm. So it’s ok if you miss morning slots on vacation. It’s fixed portion so that we don’t waste food . Quality of food was superb too. While they have option of breakfast in pool. We took it in room it was really great. Their spa is really good too. The best I found in Bali out of 4 locations we tried.

Only feedback for them would be try to include more vegetarian friendly options on menu. Rest all great. Will definitely be coming back.","We really enjoyed the satay. It was a bomb! The restaurant's setup was very nice. We enjoyed the layout and the ambience. The chairs had a unique swivel function on the back support. Cool. The spring rolls along with the condiments were top notch, especially the sambal. Service was good but the wait for our food was a little long but it was kind of expected. A great experience overall. 😃👍🏼","My family and I recently had the pleasure of staying at this hotel during our first visit to Bali, and it was an overwhelmingly pleasant introduction to the island. From the rooms to the amenities to the staff, everything about our stay was exceptional.

Arrival and First Impressions
Upon arrival, we were immediately struck by the hotel's cleanliness and meticulous maintenance. The lush surroundings and well-tended pathways created a welcoming tropical ambiance that was evident throughout the property—from the spa to the restaurant.

Rooms and Amenities
Our rooms were spacious and comfortable, providing a serene retreat after our daily adventures. The hotel is thoughtfully designed, integrating the natural beauty of Ubud with modern comforts. The pool area view offers a refreshing escape in the heart of the jungle.

Exceptional Service
What truly set this hotel apart was the exemplary service. The staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay balanced relaxation with exploration. They were not only accommodating but also incredibly proactive in helping us plan and arrange tours around Ubud. Gede, along with the rest of the team, showed an impressive level of hospitality that made us feel like family. Their positive energy and readiness to assist with any request—from the simplest to the more complex—were genuinely heartwarming. Everyone was very welcoming and respectful.

Dining and Spa
The included breakfast was thoughtfully curated and individually prepared, which we appreciated as it minimized waste and personalized our morning experience. The days we had early morning tours, they so kindly prepared takeaway boxes for us. The spa deserves a special mention; this was our first stop post a long flight, and the massage therapists were exceptional. Their expertise in delivering a relaxing full-body massage was exactly what we needed to start our vacation right.

Unique Experiences
The newly added sky lounge was a highlight, offering stunning views of the surrounding jungle. Participating in a yoga class there was an unforgettable experience that enhanced our stay. The hotel's location is ideally set within a short distance from the Ubud city center, and the availability of a shuttle service made it convenient to explore local attractions.

Conclusion
Overall, this hotel excelled in creating a nurturing environment where every aspect of our stay was cared for with great attention to detail. We left feeling not only rejuvenated but also deeply connected to the staff and the culture of Bali. We now feel like we have family to return to in Bali, and we look forward to our next visit. For anyone traveling to Ubud, looking for a blend of relaxation and local exploration, I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.","We had a memorable stay at Adiwana unagi. We were welcomed by Gede on our first day and he offered an upgrade to the villa at a reasonable cost. He also offered complimentary services for our honeymoon however we did not take up the complimentary photoshoot (regretting it!) but the villa was amazing. After checking in, we went for our spa.

The spa experience was disappointing. We did Tejas journey so it was a 4 hands massage. The girls were giggling throughout the 3hr long massage. It was unprofessional and very irritating. One of the worst spa experience.

On second night onwards, we move back to our original booked room. It was as per the photos however, be mindful of insects if you’re booking. It didn’t bothered us much. However the room’s wardrobe didn’t close properly and light was shining while we sleep. My husband also got a mini electric shock while touching the metal piece and fixing the faulty door.

Their bathtub was nice and huge. Only feedback was to provide an anti slip mat since the tub is quite huge and no headrest. So the mat would be very appreciated.

The breakfast was all day which we thoroughly enjoyed. The variety was decent and spread was sufficient to keep you very full. We tried the various cuisine.

Overall, it’s a couple place so it’s very romantic. I would want to go back because of the staff service and their efforts. Really remarkable!"

,
From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the stunning scenery. Waking up to lush rice paddies stretching before us, serenaded by birdsong, was an unforgettable experience. The Lanai room offered a cozy haven, while the private pool villa was a luxurious indulgence, allowing us to truly connect with nature during our private swims. Both accommodations were thoughtfully appointed, creating a comfortable and elegant atmosphere.

We want to express our sincere gratitude to the entire staff at Wapa di Ume for making our stay so special. You have created a haven of tranquility, delicious food, and genuine hospitality that we will cherish forever. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend your resort to anyone seeking a truly unique and unforgettable experience in Ubud","This stay truly stands out as one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had.

The hotel is situated in an incredibly picturesque area, offering a vibe of a jungle retreat.

Our room was located right in the middle of the nature. It felt remote and well connected at the same time as it was located as standalone house.

Breakfast was fantastic, with ingredients of very high quality. Every aspect of it was well planned.

One of the highlights of our stay was the rice paddy trekking they offered. Also they organise BBQ dinners with local dance, I highly recommend to attend it too.

Also shuttle was available to drive us to Ubud center.

The infinity pool overlooks the jungle was stunning. And the added activities such as local handicraft making and cake tasting enhanced our experience.

The staff went above and beyond, providing service that surpassed any I've encountered before. While officially rated as a 4-star hotel, in my opinion, the quality exceeds expectations, warranting a 5-star one.
The quality of everything this hotel was arranging was top (facilities, food, BBQ dinner, transport).

I would like to express our gratitude to the dedicated team at Wapa di Ume for creating such unforgettable memories. It is a gem in hospitality.","Our stay at this hotel was unforgettable! Not only did we receive top-notch service throughout our stay, but the staff went above and beyond to make our birthday celebration extra special. Waking up to a birthday cake at breakfast with a breathtaking view was the highlight of our trip. Highly recommend this hotel for any occasion!","Perhaps the nicest place we’ve ever stayed. Our villa was open, bright, and spacious. Our private pool offered refreshing respite from the heat. All of the furniture, from the breakfast table to the pool beds to the curved lounger to the king bed were exceptionally comfortable. The food was tasty with wonderful room service. And the best part of Wapa Di Ume is the people working here who provide the utmost hospitality at every turn. Their kindness and attention to detail are superb. We loved our stay and the memories we made here; we highly recommend Wapa Di Ume Ubud for a luxurious vacation!"

I have rarely seen such nice, courteous service.
The great cakes as dessert rounded off the evening.","This is the first restaurant we visited during our stay in Bali. We went there the first time without reading any reviews since it’s the restaurant in the hotel we stayed at. Later on, we found out that throughout our stay in Bali, we couldn’t find any restaurant that matched its level of service and quality of dishes. The food is fantastic and beautifully presented. The menu features all the best Indonesian dishes. We tried many dishes, and all were beautifully served and very tasty. In my opinion, it’s the best restaurant in Ubud and its surroundings, and one of the best on the entire island. A very good feature of this restaurant is the fantastic and friendly service that makes you feel wonderful and makes you want to come back. A very nice addition are the evening concerts, which make the time spent in the restaurant even better😊","The food was delicious - very umami.  live music for you.

But besides all of that, the place is amazing! Staff are the friendliest and most helpful of any place we have ever stayed, the attached restaurant has the best food that you could ever ask for, and the room was always pristine.

We scored room 151 at the back, and we believe it had to have been the best room in the place, with undisturbed views of the bush and complete privacy.

We will definitely stay here again and HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone. If in doubt, book this place, thank me later

Thank you Dinara family! Hope to see you again soon!","A very nice hotel. When arrived we really loved the hotel. It was clean, very nice smell in the room. It was spacious, and people very nice and service oriented.

Breakfast is nice!

Pool was a bit cold, but with the warm day it was actually nice. Unfortunately, the pool did not have anything for the children.",Loved  our stay here. The staff were wonderful  and could not do more1 to help us. For example we took their free shuttle to the town one morning and when we did not turn up for the return one (we came back early) they contacted me by WhatsApp to ask if they needed to wait for us. They also checked our room for belongings that we might have left before leaving the hotel. The pool is absolutely lovely and our room was great. The shower was fantastic!,"We spent 4 nights here (and have friends who are spending 2 weeks!) and we really liked the place!

The rooms were large and spacious - some with a terrace sit out and some with a private balcony - all with great bathtubs and comfortable beds!

The on-site restaurant is convenient when you don’t feel like stepping out, and the included breakfast is really good!

The property itself is not very large, but has some nice common areas where you can spend time, chill, work, lounge - including a beautiful swimming pool overlooking a patch of forest.

It’s about 15-20 mins away from the main hub of restaurants in town, but we liked the quiet, while still being easy to get everywhere!

Grab/Gojek and bike rentals are easily available and the monkey forest and lots of great restaurants are very close by!

The staff was also very helpful and constantly checked if things were going well and we needed anything.","Five stars for this beautiful boutique hotel. The staff make every effort to provide top notch service at all times while also being friendly and attentive enough to make this feel like a home away from home.

The hotel itself is fresh, modern and incredibly aesthetic.  We had a beautiful balcony room overlooking the garden. It was very private and spacious with a huge bath. Water, beautiful herbal tea and good coffee is provided, and an additional nighttime turndown service is also offered. There is a smart TV and room service from the adjoining restaurant.

They have complimentary yoga twice a week and a handful of other activities offered.
There isn’t a gym, however we used the yoga deck for Pilates throughout the week.

The location is great if you want to be a bit away from the bustle of Ubud centre. Everything you need is nearby within a few minutes walking, a great (but expensive gym), a few good cafes/warungs and a laundry (cheaper than the hotel).
The hotel has a shuttle to the centre (complimentary) twice a day.

The food from the adjoining restaurant is delicious and fresh with a rang of Indonesian and other options. This is where the included breakfast was offered each morning (until 11am, a great time). The breakfast was a la carte with juice or fruit platter, coffee/tea and a main. Plenty of options, we stayed a week with something different each day. Again, the service here was fantastic."

There is a wide choice for breakfast, lunch and evening, with a complimentary afternoon tea also on offer.  Many thanks to Wayan and Daisy and your colleagues - I‘m sorry we didn’t get to know all of your names.

Our only issue during our stay was the steep stairs down to the pool and restaurant area. There is no handrail which meant my husband, who uses a walking stick, needed help to get back up the steps to the main path between the rooms. Definitely not the place for those in wheelchairs but a handrail could make a difference for those with mobility difficulties. Hopefully the hotel owners would consider this in future.

Thank you to all of the team for looking after us so well during our stay at your beautiful hotel.","A very quiet place exuding rustic charm, located conveniently near central Ubud market. Stay here to experience an actual getaway.
Limited food options, but what they serve is really good. There are also multiple quality restaurants at walkable distance if you want to explore other options. And as always, excellent service and hospitality.","We stayed here for 4 nights ,this place was absolutely amazing with breathtaking views of the jungle ,so peaceful to sit outside at night and listen to the sounds of birds and animals in the jungle ,we had a private pool which was beautiful, the room was stunning and immaculately clean ,very spacious
The bathroom was amazing huge bath ,and waterfall shower . The bed had an insect net around it and was quite romantic, we has a couple of little visitors in our room small lizards which didn't bother us at all . The food was excellent and beautifully presented and very tasty 😋 really reasonable priced .The staff was excellent and very efficient in serving us ,I didn't want to leave this place ,I would give this place 10 out of 10 and would definitely recommend.
If I ever go back to bali I will definitely stay here again .","Hot water wasn't working consistently throughout our stay. Got to shower with cold water. Also, aircond was not cold enough despite setting at highest fan and 16 degree.

Love the view and service from all staffs though.","Didn’t stay at the hotel but ate at the restaurant three times a year and a half ago and came back especially for the food when in ubud

We ordered the Avocado Pesto and Champs Choice and I have to say this avocado is literally melting, nothing like I have ever tasted . Totally worth it and the prices are fair for the quality. Thank you for the service as well !","This place is amazing and a must do restaurant if you are in the area!

Melali is attached to the Dinara hotel and is easily one of the best restaurants in Ubud for quality and value. Being that we were staying at the Dinara, this place quickly became our regular restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner, both dine in and room service is offered and the food is always amazing!

I will let the attached photos do the talking for the food quality! The breakfast is always amazing, and I eventually tried everything, but the Sunrise bowl quickly became my favourite.

I have to give a special mention to our favourite waiter Asmara! This guy always brightened our morning and was great for a chat. But overall the Staff and atmosphere was always great!

Thanks Melali family! Hope to see you again soon!","We stayed at a villa next door to this fantastic Melali Restaurant. This was a great place to come for breakfast and dinner. They have many different cuisines and they cater for gluten free and coeliac, you will need to talk to the waiter for your dietary requirements. After going there over 5 times I highly recommend their CRÈME BRÛLÉE 🍮 🤤","We stayed 6 nights at Dinara Hotel and enjoyed breakfast everyday at Melali.
The team is amazing: they greet you politely and most importantly they remember you! The inclusive breakfast menu is very well explained and varied - you can try different things every day, and you cannot get bored (from traditional dishes to trendier ones, the menu will suit everyone).
It was so great that we enjoyed dinner every night as well ;)
Thank you Melali Team","Delicious food every time. Beautiful interior and light music.

Service may be better. They don't bring you water while you wait for your order, although you are allowed one glass for free if you ask. And it looks like they give you water unwillingly, sometimes pointing out that only one glass is free. Well, you can tell this if I ask for the second glass, right?

Also, once I came alone to almost empty cafe on a daytime and got a question: for how many person? Again, this question may be meaningful when the cafe is at least half-full. Otherwise, it feels like I look like I need assistance in choosing my favourite place. 🤔

Also, for 2 different dishes (egg rosti and sweet waffles), I was served only one set of cutlery.

Great coffee. Although cappuccino is served with no accompanied sugar by default. And you aren't asked before if you would like sugar or not.

Thus, you may need to make extra efforts to get what should be served by default.

Another thing that may bother people is that in order to connect to WiFi, you need to do it manually every time entering rather long password. And you get automatically disconnected about every 30 minutes or so. Amusing customer service during the hightech era."

My favorite was the veggie dumplings.","Dinner was really good! Great ambiance and excellent taste. There was live music as well, and the staff was really friendly.

- ⭐️ Tres Carne Tacos (89k): Tacos were great. Loved the fillings.
- ⭐️ Chotto Matte Gyoza (55k): One of the best gyoza I’ve ever tasted! Must try!
- Chicken Parmigiana (89k): The batter was a bit thick, but the taste itself was great.
- Mad Abe Chicken Ramen (79k): The ramen was cooked perfectly and served with plenty of chicken.","Nestled in a charming setting, this delightful venue offers not only a lovely ambiance but also exceptional service. The staff are wonderfully attentive, enhancing the experience with their warmth and efficiency. The breakfast is delicious. A truly enchanting visit awaits at this beautiful bistro.","I went here for both dinner and breakfast. It is the closest location to Adiwana Sweta (connected to the hotel.) Each time we ate there we had a pleasant experience. The staff were extremely attentive and checked in on us often.

The first night I had lentil soup and it was the best I've had in the 6 years I've lived in SE Asia! The gyoza was also quite good.

Then for breakfast I had the avocado toast and coffee. The avo toast comes with poached eggs and a balsamic salad. A nutritious way to start an exciting day of exploring.

The coffee is exceptional and strong enough for my personal liking.

A great memory I have from going is a conversation with our server Risma. She was friendly, attentive, and had so many good recommendations on how to spend our day.

The one thing I want to suggest is during the night when the musician is performing it would be great if they can dim the lights. Especially for jazz night.","Had breakfast here everyday while staying at Adiwana Suweta. The food was great, but more exceptional was the staff who were thoughtful and always looking out for your every need. Thank you Arik and team for the loveliest experience in Bali. Every meal was a delight!"

Thus it is a bit far (like 15min walking-if you want to walk) from the center but still very close to fantastic restaurants! The rooms are super clean, the pool is nice and cool! So if you want to enjoy the luxury while staying in Ubud it’s a nice option.","We spent 12 days at Ketuts place villas over Christmas and new years. It was spectacular! All the staff were exceptional. Fantastic service. The property at the villas is gorgeous. The royal villa we stayed in was overlooking the jungle ravine. We went to Ketut’s bed and breakfast (1 km closer to town centre) for Christmas dinner where the family made everything fresh that day. Amazing Balinese meal! We were happy to stay a little ways out of town centre, Ubud is busy! You can take the shuttle or walk to town centre. We also enjoyed the spa there! I would highly recommend ketuts place villas."

Highly recommended","Rooms got water seepage and leaking beyond acceptance. Properly is ill designed as too many steps with steep ups and downs added to that NO ELEVATOR AT ALL.DISSAPPOINTED, only solace is service by few of their staff.","We were EXTREMELY disappointed by the service provided by Nata Ubud.

First of all, when we checked in, the room had dead insects in the toilet which was horrifying. We had to call them up to clean it and we asked them to inspect the room for any more dead roaches & they “claimed” that they had deep cleaned the room.
However, when we returned in the evening excited to sleep after a long tiring day, we saw flying cockroaches on our bed and under the bed - some were dead and some were alive which showed that they didn’t clean the room properly. It was our honeymoon and it was ruined by them. We kindly asked them to give us another room, however, the attendant informed us that they didn’t have any vacant rooms apart from a family room and that he couldn’t move us there and we’d have to deal with it or leave to another hotel and get a full refund so we did just that and returned back the following day to pick up our refund & guess what - they backed out on giving us the refund and lied that they never promised it to us and gave us a hard time to get back our refund. Until now, they’re asking us to do this and that to get back our 50% refund even tho we booked it for 2 days and didn’t stay there at all 🙃 the staff here only cares about money and they’ll do anything to make sure they retain that while doing little to nothing to treat their customers with care or integrity!

Save yourselves please and book with another hotel!","A nice place to find quiet. The room was nice with stars hotel standard, small number of guests make it private. Friendly staff. But parking available for motorcycles only","This is a lovely small hotel with a nice and quiet pool, good breakfast and a very friendly service. Especially Indra and Asih are excellent hosts and always do their magic to help you enjoy your stay. The hotel is not too close to Ubud center. We stayed with a baby so it was a little bit difficult to get around since the roads are not convenient for strollers and the taxis don’t carry car seats so you always have to bring your own. But if you can just jump on a GrabBike it’s super easy to get there and you might enjoy being outside of the city center.
The rooms are simple but nice and spacious. The bed was excellent. They also provided a baby bed for free. Only the bathrooms could use some better furniture. In total, I recommend Nata Ubud - it offers very good value for money."

The pool and communal seating areas are also very pretty and the place is surrounded by nature giving an amazing view from the room. Located outside of the busy central Ubud but not too far. However, there is a major problem which made our stay so unpleasant we had to leave after one night (despite planning for 4). That is the cleanliness of the room. The bathroom had a significant mould problem and a nasty stench which became apparent after several hours of being there. The carpet and floors were dirty and the bedsheets stained. The bedding was also a bit damp and smelly. We were really uncomfortable and cut our stay short because of this. Again the staff were great but the place needs quite a bit of work.","Absolutely loved our stay here.
The staff are so attentive and kind.

Location is a perfect in my opinion, it’s close enough to walk into central Ubud but also far enough away to be away from the hustle and bustle.

The rooms were good and spacious, the most amazing view from the balcony into the jungle.

Finally, the pool area is great. Decent size pool with an infinity design overlooking the jungle again. Also, has lovely seating around it to just chill.","Loved our stay here, the location was perfect just out of the hussle and bustle of Ubud centre but close enough to walk or get a quick taxi. The view from the room to the rainforest is gorgeous and the rooms are very spacious.

The staff were so friendly and helpful, giving us a lift on the bikes at no charge on two occasions and also driving 20 minutes to meet us when I left valuables in the room. I am very grateful.

Room was clean and tidy and the pool area was beautiful to relax in of an afternoon.","Happy to be here for our family vacation.
The room is really comfortable, clean, and the bed  in a perfect size with a lot of pillow so we can protect the baby/toddler if you stay with them.

I recently had a fantastic dining experience at Lumbung, an Indonesian restaurant that left me thoroughly impressed. From the moment we stepped in, the ambiance and service were top-notch. The attentive and friendly staff, especially our waiter Komang, made our visit truly memorable.

Lumbung excels in serving authentic Indonesian cuisine, and I was thrilled to explore the flavors and spices that make this cuisine so unique. The dishes were a delightful blend of traditional Indonesian flavors, expertly prepared to satisfy even the most discerning palates. Be prepared for a bit of a kick in some of the spicier options, but fear not, as Komang was more than willing to assist us in tailoring the dishes to suit our European taste preferences. His collaboration with the chef ensured that the food remained enjoyable while maintaining its authenticity.

One aspect that truly stood out was the exquisite dessert selection. The sweet indulgence at Lumbung was beyond compare. Every bite was a symphony of flavors and textures, leaving us wanting more. The restaurant truly excels in offering a complete dining experience, from the appetizers to the main course and, of course, the mouthwatering desserts.

As for the location, Lumbung offers a mesmerizing view of an illuminated waterfall, adding an enchanting touch to the entire dining experience. The combination of delicious food, excellent service, and a breathtaking setting makes Lumbung a must-visit destination.

Overall, Lumbung is a gem of a restaurant that delivers on all fronts. The attentive service provided by Komang, the authentic Indonesian cuisine, and the stunning location make it an exceptional dining experience. I highly recommend Lumbung to anyone seeking a taste of Indonesia in a charming and picturesque setting.",We went there to celebrate my fiancé’s birthday.

We were both blown away by the quality of the food. Nothing ground breaking on the menu, just really well made Indonesian staples.
We started with spring rolls that were perfectly crunchy, with a delicious and soft filling.
We then had chicken with black pepper sauce that had a hint of sweetness to complement the spiciness of the pepper. Very tasty.
The Mie Goreng, so simple but delicious, with cabbage, mushroom and chicken.
Finally, seafood and vegetable tempura. Once again, perfectly crunchy without being oily, and a lovely home made dipping sauce.
All this and a Coke and tea for 110k.

Rooms are spacious and are cleaned every day.  They also have free water and amenities in the rooms.
Special for us was the Tokay Gecko which lived in the roof of the villa and was heard in the night. Absolutely unique experience we loved it. A beautiful surprise.
If you like your quietness and have a scooter in Ubud, as it is located a bit (10min) outside the city, you will find your place to stay here.","The location is far enough out of town that it's inconvenient, but not isolated enough to be truly peaceful. Getting in and out is a pain as it's not located on any road and you can only get to the door via bike or by walking up a steep hill for a few minutes after a car takes you as close as possible. The location, however, is not isolated enough to be truly peaceful, with the sound of agriculture equipment and construction a constant in the background. The room we had was poor, and if you were here to relax I would have been disappointed. We stayed in the Mountain View room with Balcony. What we got was a room with a view obstructed by a neighbouring bungalow's roof (see photo) and a balcony that was pokey and in full sun, leaving it unusable. The bathroom/toilet is partially open to the bed area and the water that came out of the shower was exceptionally dirty. I was only there for a night, but had it been longer I would have been looking for an alternative. The staff weren't particularly helpful and recommended Grab and Gojek when I asked for help getting around. I had booked an airport transfer through reception and was left in the lurch when the driver asked me to pay cash up front, which I didn't have after just arriving in the country. I could have booked somewhere more convenient for half the price of a similar quality. It was a disapointing stay over all.",Nice hotel in a calm area of Ubud. The staff was really nice and helpful. They help us to rent a motorbike and a taxi. Breakfast is really good with several options. The room and bathroom are clean and in good conditions.
