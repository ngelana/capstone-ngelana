I think it's the only one that looks pretty good and wasn't dirty or dilapidated.","Temple for local people. It was quite and peaceful.

It's possible to go through the ceremony, which symbolizes cleaning inside (by praying) and outside (by water). If you want, you can leave donation, otherwise it's free.","Quiet little temple in a remote village. Costs 5k to enter, and then a little walk down the ravine. Has a place where you can perform a purification ceremony, and swim in the river. You can rent a sarong and a locker for 20k each of needed. Only locals there when I went. Perfect spot to meditate and relax, and quite a cool spot too.","Quiet and peaceful place. We really enjoyed melukat there, the Pemangku was nice and explained lots of things to us. Personally, I felt so relaxed and happy after our visit.",Beautiful place.  Go with a local Balinese and do purification Ceremony .  Most Balinese go for purification 2-3 times a month - as often as possible.  The holy spring is so clean and pure and it‚Äôs a Bangli - about 40 mins from Ubud.  The energy here is so peaceful.

This place has a good ambiance and you can swim there.
The food just was ok, i think they need more development about the taste and the portion.

My college who had a party here took a package of ayam bakar they come with rice, ayam bakar, and vegetables (i think its sayur urap?) and lalapan cucumber tomato.
The ayam bakar is pretty good with a big size of chicken thigh with sweet spicy taste. But i think it still need sambal merah pedas to make it more like indonesian ayam bakar with spicy sambal
? ü§î
Nah the fail menu in here its the ‚Äúsayur urap‚Äù because it taste nothing even they add some spicy spice there but it doesn‚Äôt taste anything. Just like a cold blanched vegetables. So it doesn‚Äôt match the taste with ayam bakar.
But the portion its good.

For nasi goreng the portion is too small for the price around 21-27k. The nasi goreng come with 2 chicken satay, fried egg, kerupuk, pickles and sambal kecap manis. The chicken satay it quite to dry.
So for me the nasi goreng need more development with the rice portion and the dried satay.

But i would come again here by my self to taste another menu. Btw for the management i think the need to concern about the white pathway around the swimming pool because its too slippery. Even your staf already put the sign to be careful, but still its dangerous when its get wet.

For the price it‚Äôs good and still reasonable. And we can reserve this place for gathering, party or a meeting. Its a new good place in bangli üëç","Dined in for lunch on the way from Kintamani. Doesn't look much from the outside because it's walled off. When we walked in, however, the resto was spacious, there were some outdoor tables, a small stage  for live music (looks like) and a small pool to dip in. With Bangli's weather, it was cozy during the day. We had ayam goreng UUMA and nasi babi bali. Both are nice, portions are medium, the pork a bit chewy. Great venue for groups or events. Will return if we come to Bangli again.","Great place, probably one of the best in Bangli. Delicious food at a good price, nice atmosphere and music. I come here often and can recommend the chicken pizza and quesadilla. Natural juices are also very tasty. I recommend itüëç","Take too long to get the food served to the table. It took 1 hour. Food taste 7/10. Vibe 8/10. Friendliness 8/10. Overall, not bad for Bangli area.","The first time I came to this place with my girlfriend, I felt the feel of Ubud. highly recommended"
