Not easy to find. Must spend money, but not much. Food is delicious from local cuisine. Very  isolated. One of few clean toilets outside hotels in Bali.","This one is helluva nice place for you to visit, if you're into the view of wide forest or trees. Located in a hill, you can see a landscape with only trees in front of you. They also made swings, house trees, and chairs with desk so you can enjoy the scenery even more. They also provide you soft drinks and instant noodles.

The entrance fee was super cheap!! But you have to push your vehicle hard if you have plan to drop by this location. It's hard to find. :)
Btw, no worries if you use car, the parking lot is wide enough to mantain one until three cars. Well it's not a formal parking area but the place runs by locals anyway, so yea. If you're into highlands and the view of trees, come here!","Good view, lots of swings, and durians",Best venue so far,
