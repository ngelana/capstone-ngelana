The area is amazing ! I stayed directly in the rice fields and enjoyed every day my breakfast and dinner with a great view! The food was really good, the stuff lovely and the room/bath clean. I'm really recommending this place!!!","Great view with affordable price. The place is clean and the staffs are friendly. Young tour guide will take care your children. You can choose variety of foods, from traditional balinese food to simple western style breakfast. You can spend your time by hiking to nearest waterfall, sightseeing on rice field, or just mingle with locals to know their culture.","THIS is an awesome place to stay. The host is super friendly so we felt at home instantly. The beds are cosy and our bathroom was one of the best we had in Bali so far. We can definitely recommend the local tour with Ibu Jeru through the ricefields and to the local coffeefarmer! Also ask her for Dadar Gulung, the green pancakes with grated coconut and palm sugar. They are super delicious and maybe she will show you how to make them. We stayed for 3 nights and will come back for sure. Terima kasi from Germany!","Very nice and lovely homestay close to Munduk in the village of Gobleg. This homestay has two rooms for two people and one bigger room for up to four people. The views are amazing (see pictures) as it is located right in the rice terrasses. The staff and owner are extremely friendly. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served and food is really tasty. Its also easy to reach Munduk and the waterfalls with a ðŸ›µ from the homestay. Really enjoyed our stay","Hy, I'm trying to contact you. We actually want to Book a room, Can i get your Hotel WhatsApp number...!?"

Spacious rooms and batheroom with thub . (Hot water Works perfectly)
Spoted rigth on the road in center of mundunk. Not so quiet but it is greta to find some locals shops and food. The manager and staff are so nice. They bring us to a trekking att secret waterfall, amazing and so exclusive, best waterfall expÃ©rience ever!","The place is wonderful. It is composed of two beautiful and charming bungalows in total. It is equipped with state of the art amenities (the bed is very high quality and comfortable, a huge bath tub and nice Italian shower). You have a lot of space. There is also a nice pool, with some private tables for each bungalow, and a place to chill.
The staff is very friendly and will help you for the different activities you want to do in the region (waterfalls, trekking, etc.). Breakfast is good (and included). Possibility to have the laundry done.

Why not 5 stars :
The hotel is quite isolated, so there are very few options around (or you need a scooter to go to Munduk cause taxis are scarce and very pricey, no grab here), and the food for diner is decent at best.
It is located next to a road with quite some traffic, it gets very noisy at night with motorcycles and animals (dogs, roosters, ...) And quite bright in the morning. We slept quite well with masks and ear plugs though, but that may be an issue for those who are not used to that.","This place is one of its kind in Bali. Firstly, Munduk is awesome if you like waterfalls and trekking. I guci is very relaxing pool bungalow with ample space for couples with kids. The staff is very polite and friendly. Loads of privacy here with delicious food. Loved it!",Lovely place for staying . Good kitchen,Friendly and good for stay
