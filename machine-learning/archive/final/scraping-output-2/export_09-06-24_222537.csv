We enjoyed the beautiful villa and surroundings. The villa is situated beachfront very spacious and clean with a magnificent infinity pool overlooking the sea. Nicely secluded on a private road and lush landscaped grounds. The villa staff, Iluh, Sayu and Agus are all very discreet, warm and engaging. All meals were beautifully presented and tasty. We will be back for sure. This is so much more peaceful than our stay in Seminyak. Thank you so much for the absolutely positive experience.
Gerd and Nancy, Vancouver","My family and I stayed at Villa Sali in March and if I had the choice I would have never left. The villa is absolutely amazing with beautiful views overlooking the ocean, an incredible pool, 4 large rooms and an incredible and gracious staff that made our stay extra special. In fact the staff is one of the best features of the villa. Ilu and Sayu are incredible cooks and made us breakfast every morning. Agus worked the garden and got us fresh coconut. At night it is so quiet and peaceful and we were lulled to sleep by the sound of the ocean. The villa staff arranged scooter rentals for us, arranged for a morning dolphin tour where the boat picked us up in front of the villa and were always so helpful. Internet was solid and fast and we never had an issue with it except during thunderstorms when the power went out a few times. I highly recommend Villa Sali as a great place to stay in North Bali away from the hustle and bustle of the main tourist area of south Bali. We will definitely be staying here again very soon.","We loved our time here, simply and completely. I'm going to butcher the spelling, but Aluh and Sayu, the helpers at the house, were wonderful and friendly. They prepared most of our meals and literally everything we ate was delicious! The house itself was quiet, calm, and equipped beautifully for a family or big groups travelling together. Two of the main highlights were the pool and Cabana outside by the beach. We spent much of our time there. One day I wasn't feeling well and spent it on the comfy couch in front of the TV with the doors wide open and still loved every minute. There are quite a few ants around the property as is expected in Bali.","Amazing villa in front of the beach.
Clean,nice garden and very Friendly staff with good cooking. Easy to go and see real of Bali from here with good knowledlege driver to explore the islands
Thank you for your wonderfull time in Bali","The Villa is all one can dream of. Located on the Beach, great pool. The staff is very good, polite, professional. To say it short, absolutely perfect place for dream holiday."

Iloo (E- Lu) and Ketut took very good care of us and our masseur (I've, unfortunately, forgotten her name) made sure that we were relaxed and pampered with facials and pedicures too!

The house is beautiful, the sea is near and it's quiet and relaxing.  This house is for those who want to relax, who aren't interested in the party scene.

You can rely upon Iloo to manage day trips and coordinate drivers for you - everything from trips to the grocery and money changers to day trips to see dolphins or waterfalls.

The sea is but a single step off the property but there's no need to swim in the sea as the infinity pool is inviting and just off the veranda with its own open elevated lounge area.

If you get the opportunity to book Villa Bossi, grab it, you won't regret it.  We certainly don't!","Luxury villa at the beach,, nice for relaxing.
From here we can visiting all Bali area with luxury  and comfotable car with good experience  driver.
