Open the doors to your private balcony and enjoy the ocean view from the pool. The room is very nice and has an authentic look and feel. Its uphill but they provide a free shuttle to get down to the main street. We‚Äôve also rented a scooter here and it was also in very good condition. Way better than we had so far during our trip. Roads are small and sometimes a bit rough so thats important. However if you‚Äôre not an experienced scooter driver, its better to do a day tour with a private driver which you can also book via reception.","So we stayed for 4 days in the Mambo Hill Resort and it was a blast. We really enjoyed the Rooms at the poolside, accessing the pool out of your own room is amazing. The view is also absolutely astonishing, you look just above the jungle to the see. Simply Beautiful.

Not to mention that the food was very delicious!
They also have a special shuttle service to the other Hotel called Mambo Beach Resort which is obviously at the beach and has a beautiful ambiente at the evening.

We enjoyed the stay and would definitely recommend the Hotel!!

Thanks tot he Mambo Team","Had a great week here at the hill resort, and will definitely stay here again if I ever come to Nusa Penida again. Very convenient transport between the hill and beach resort, and pickup at the harbor. Staffs are really nice and friendly. View from the room is amazing, breakfast is simple but tasty (love the pancakes). Only downside is that you can here the sound from the other rooms sometimes can be noisy but they provided earplugs for this","I recently stayed at Mambo Hill Hotel and Resort Nusa penida for a getaway and was thoroughly impressed by the experience. From the moment I arrived, the service was exceptional. The staff greeted me warmly and ensured a smooth check-in process. My room was spacious, impeccably clean, and tastefully decorated, offering a panoramic view of the sea shore .

The amenities are top-notch. The on-site restaurant served a diverse menu with delicious options for all meals. I particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which featured fresh, local ingredients and a variety of choices to suit different dietary preferences.

One of the highlights of my stay was the  pool. It provided a relaxing escape with stunning views, comfortable lounge chairs, and prompt poolside service.

Overall, my stay was memorable. The combination of excellent service, luxurious accommodations, and prime location makes it a perfect choice for anyone visiting the city. I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to my next visit.","It‚Äôs a big WOW. Excellent environment, welcomed with lush green lobby and friendly staffs. The hotel design is super pretty, full of Balinese craft works and it has direct access to the pool! ü§© The room has perfect view toward Mt. Agung, sunrise and sunset. And they have butler service to mambo beach resorts too. Kudos to Mambo! Would love to be back here again."

The room was a nice surprise for the price. Spacious and have everything you need if you are not fussy about the details. It‚Äôs a little far from the centre but they will give u a ride via scooter if u don‚Äôt have one!

The diving centre was amazing, everyone was so sweet and welcoming!! I had the best three days with everyone and honestly couldn‚Äôt bear to leave as i fell in love with the place and people. I will be back for sure üôèüèª","This hotel was a very nice discovery. Surrounded by beautiful vegetation, quiet, I loved this place.

The service is impeccable. The rooms are very spacious with plenty of room for business storage.
I can only recommend this hotel to future visitors of Nusa Penida.

Florence","Heyyoo! I‚Äôm sad to post this review despite all of the positive feedbacks here. I like the style of the rooms and closeness to the seaside as well as the idea that I would spend time in a nice place with the sauna, but it turned out that pictures differs from the reality.
For a few days to see Nusa Penida it‚Äôs okay but in fact it is a moldy place with a lot of insects inside. In our room it was a very poor lighting in the toilet and after the sunset we were taking shower almost in a dark.
We tried sauna and I think it‚Äôs broken because every time we entered we got a slight electricity shotüôàü•≤
I‚Äôd like to know that this will be helpful next time for the other guests and I‚Äôll be glad to help owners to fix everything because I think (especially with the sauna) it‚Äôs ridiculous to leave it like it is!","The room is spacious, comfortable, & clean. The staff is also very helpful & friendly. The bathroom, however, is kinda dark daytime as it uses black ceramics. And as we unfortunately come in rainy season, there are many small caterpillars in the area, but if it‚Äôs sunny, there won‚Äôt be any caterpillars being said.","I really love this little gem up the hill. Away from the crowed, surrounded by trees. The rooms are big, clean and are made in a minimalistic modern style. You can have a hot shower or dipping into the pool. Even a Sauna can this place offer. There is plenty of space for cars or motorcycles. A little open lounge place whit a kitchen invites for dinner with friends. Ketut, a staff member, is welcoming you with his warm and gentle persona. Here I feel taken care, I can relax or work. I found a home away from home."

The owner treated me as part of his family! drove everywhere for food, took me to medical center after I got super sick from snorkeling trip. I was feeling so helpless since I went by myself.

As long as you stay here, you are our family‚Äù omg!!! How sweet is that! I‚Äôve stayed in canggu for three weeks and no one treated me the way this owner/host treats his guests! This morning he even took me with his scooter to the famous beach. It takes 1hr one way and usually charges 200K for a guided tour but he told me it‚Äôs free!
