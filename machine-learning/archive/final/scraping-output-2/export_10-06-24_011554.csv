I stayed for a month here and had the best experience while I'm there. There was housekeeping once a week and they had a great wifi connection. For food, I had to find it through Gofood/ Grabfood since there are not many food vendors near the place.

The place is quite far from the main tourist attraction (Canggu, Kuta, Seminyak, etc.), but if you want to relax and stay in a quiet neighbourhood, this is the place. My favourite beach near this place is Pantai Pura Geger, go there almost every day :)
Overall I had a great experience, if I want to stay in Nusa dua, totally will stay at this place again.",good,"clean,calm and nice play to stay....although its far to reach it...",,

It's quiet and peaceful, and close to all the main roads and stores. On the beach Nusa beautiful and long promenade, there is a theater, cinema and a lot of cool cafe/restaurants.

But if you have already decided on Nusa Dua, but have not found a place to live ‚Äî I think you are lucky, because you will not have to move your suitcases from your guesthouse to H2O Homestayü§£. I'll be honest: stumbling upon this house and family was the best accident that happened to us in Bali. H2O is more than ""living in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood with a beautiful view"".
There you will understand what ""hospitality"" is all about and find people to your liking. Be careful: breaking up with H2O is hard and dangerous for your heart ü§≠","The staying at H2O Homestay Bali was an experience I don‚Äôt want to miss in my life.
The hosts were one of the nicest and kindest persons I have ever met in my life!
They will help you where ever they can and tell you a lot about the Balinese culture.
The accommodation is very clean and spacious, neighbourhood is beautifull and very nice located in a quiet and peaceful place.
I really recommend this place, if you are looking for nice people, comfortable stay and peace.","I was staying here for about 7 weeks and I was really pleased staying at H2O as it is a very nice homestay, modern and with all the facilities needed, clean and comfortable. It is ideally situated for visiting many places in Bali. If you need healing place for your soul and mind, this homestay is the right place too. The owner are very good, friendly and helpful.","Recommended place to stay, if you are looking for a place in peaceful and good surroundings and nearby lively environments,  then this place might be one of the choices. It is close to stunning beaches and tourist spots.

The host is also very friendly and helpful. You may ask the host too for any hidden gems in Bali.

Super recommended!! üòçüòçüòç","This homestay was an absolute gem! It felt more like staying with welcoming friends than at a typical hotel. The hosts were incredibly warm and helpful, going above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and enjoyable. I highly recommend this homestay to anyone seeking a unique and delightful place to stay."
