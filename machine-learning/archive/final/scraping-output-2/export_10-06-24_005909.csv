The owners really pay attention on detail and care. Stayed here for 5 days and really enjoyed the atmosphere of Balinese village and natural culture.
Breakfast fullfilled my stomach needs and got me satisfied ü´∞üèª","Warm, humble and very attentive host.
Spacious room and efforts to make sure details well take care of. Clean bedroom with artistic drawings and lighting.
Healthy and complete breakfast.","A perfect gateway from the crowds at Kuta/Ubud during holiday season is definitely an adjoined family compound/art studio at sukawati hosted by the artist mr. made and the family. The place is nothing short of holding certain aesthetic appeals to the senses. Overflowing with gratitude with nothing less than stellar experience surrounded by arts and how certain placements of objects make big differences. The hospitality is top-notch. Every produce that goes from farm to table is fresh. Clear skies, fresh air, and warm welcome is what you need to celebrate the festive season. Definitely a place to visit and come back when in sukawati.","What a wonderful hidden gem in a village!

The host, Pak Made Kaek and Ibu Rika, were very humble and welcoming. It makes us felt like coming home. The room was super clean, with big bed, spacious (both the bedroom and the bathroom). Unexpectedly, but fortunately, the room is decorated with several paintings by the host. There is also the art gallery exhibition. We also got breakfast (kinda full breakfast). Coffee or tea, fruits, some banana chips, and fried rice.

Would love to be back here soon! Thank you, Rumah Paros ‚ù§Ô∏è","We stayed 4 nights in a studio 1st floor, we are a family 2 adults and 2 kids. The property is very nice, clean calm and the owner and his family are very very very nice. The breakfast is delicious. The property is close to the Art Market, Ubud is just 25mn."
