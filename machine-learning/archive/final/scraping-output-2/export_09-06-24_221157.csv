When the bill came, they not only charged us for the full fish but also charged us 175k for shrimp (also very poor quality) that was on the menu for 30k (see picture).
When we asked the owner he became aggressive, shouting at us and frightening our 8 year old son.
After a long time he adjusted the bill telling us to never come back again. Advice we will surely follow.
