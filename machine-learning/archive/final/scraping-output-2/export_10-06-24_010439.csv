The food I ordered was very good! The chicken burger was one of the best I ever had! The smoothie bowl was okay but nothing amazing and same thing for the cold rolls.
The atmosphere was very nice but was a bit too hot because it's all open so there's no Aircon.
The staff were friendly and helpful.
The prices are a bit high but I suggest try it out.","Food review:
I ordered popeyes chicken burger it‚Äôs so delicious! I added fries also was so good. Order came quickly and food was great.

Price: it was pricey comparing other restaurants in Bali, but as experience it worth it.

Atmosphere review: the place is big gives garden vibes nice music in background. I enjoyed it there would definitely recommend a try.","Very nice Bohemian-style atmosphere and definitely photo-worthy. Aside from the beautiful setting, the food we ordered was very tasty and well presented. We had the Truffle fries, Greek chicken, and the Chicken burger. The food came out fast enough and beautifully plated. Staff were attentive and spoke good english, we had our waiter recommend the excellent food choices. The pricing is fair - I have been to other restaurants charging more for food, and I didn't even get close to the quality, presentation, or atmosphere that Penny Lane offers. I would recommend anyone to come to this place due to its atmosphere, quality of food and value for money.",Very beautiful and vibey cafe in Canggu with an extensive brunch menu. Loaded fries were the unexpected star. Burgers looked slightly weird (why did they stick a weiner/chicken wing inside üòÇ) but were tasty.,"Amazing food and drinks. A very cool restaurant with lots of art and music. We ordered Mac and cheese ball, fired chicken and steaks. The drinks were also really good. I think we drank four amaretto sours. We ate at this spot 2 evenings. Very polite and kind staff. Not much waiting time either."

This place serves Asian fusion cuisine, and the server was super attentive and friendly, patiently explaining the menu to us. The ambiance is family-friendly with a great vibe. Overall, a fantastic dining experience that definitely did not disappoint!","The food is very nice but there are other things need to be fixed!

The hostess in front of the door is the rudest person I have ever seen!! she keeps pointing out her finger while speaking to you and warning you that you have to be here 10 mins earlier prior to your booking time or you will lose your table!!! The food is very nice so it is better to work on some customer service!",Great spot for brunch in Canggu! We ordered the brunch dry ramens which were super tasty. The service was friendly and the food came out quick. Small detail but our coffees took and while to make and came after we had finished our food. Would have been nice to have before or while eating. We will be back!,"Came here three times during my trip. The Miso pancakes were the star of the show for me, and perhaps my single favorite dish in all of Canggu. The perfect blend of complexity and indulgence. I found myself wanting more the second I finished. Love that they‚Äôre not afraid to add in some salty components. Great work here, highly highly recommended.

For me, the dry ramen was underwhelming. The flavors were really familiar and not as experimental as I was hoping for a place with this reputation.

I loved the mango mousse. Felt like spring on a dish. Bright, complex but elegant like a symphony.","Arrived promptly at 9 am to find a lengthy queue, but it's a testament to the food's popularity. The dry ramen and quesadillas are top notch, especially the flavor packed quesadillas. They offer complimentary refills of mineral water, but don't miss out on their stellar drink menu the ""Dirty"" espresso with its secret sauce is a must try! Bonus points for the presence of Benji, the serene and friendly dog among the staff. Great experience overall! üê∂"

We came at lunch time and the place was very busy.

There is a playground at the back for kids to play, there was a slide and a kids club for drawing etc.

We tried several dishes and everything was delicious! The calamari was crunchy and tasty with a mild sauce, the burger was really good as well.
They have kids menu that comes with fries, fruits and juice and a main dish you can choose from

Our favourite was The pesto chicken melt. It was absolutely delicious, the chicken were tender, the cheese melts to perfection and it taste wonderful!

The only downside was the weather was kinda hot so it feels kinda humid with all the crowd inside, and parking for car is a bit tricky.

But overall, it was a lovely lunch. Thank you","Had a wonderful experience at Milk& Madu. The food was not only beautiful but also delicious. My mom keep telling the family and her friends to go to Milk & Madu, and keep talks about how great the food was.

Their spiced cauliflower and fire grilled carrots are to die for. The chicken main is huge! Bread pudding is delish. Everything is delicious. Reserve in advance. Very nice ambience and friendly staff. Definitely recommend.,"One of must go to restaurants if you visited Bali, Located in Canggu area. Mason atmosphere very pleasant, with tables in a semi-outdoor area. I would suggest you to make a reservation beforehand, as the restaurant can get very busy at times. Otherwise, you might have to wait for a long time for a table. I have been to this restaurant a few times and I think it is a great place to dine in. They offer a wide variety of food options, and the ones I have tried, such as 48h beef, pork loin, baba ganoush, and potato puree were all good. I‚Äôd highly recommend trying the bread pudding, it was absolutely delicious! What I learned after visiting here couple of times, it has taken quite a while for them to prepare the food. Therefore, you may have to wait for a bit before your food arrives, worry not cause you will love the food cause it was so good. The restaurant also has a great selection of drinks to choose from.
Overall, the dishes were exceptional and I‚Äôd highly recommend this restaurant to anyone planning to visit Bali. I always ordered the best steak they offered, along with several other dishes, and all of the food was very good. Amazing food. I feel like Mason had the best service, staffs were really polite, friendly and service minded. They will ask you if you need more water and being there when we needed anything.

Mason in Canggu, and I had to share my experience! I usually only write reviews for really good or really bad places, and M. Mason definitely falls into the ""really good"" category. I love simple seafood, and it's hard to find here without lots of sauce or frying. But M. Mason was perfect. Even though I didn't have a reservation and wanted to sit outside (which wasn't available at first), the hostess was so nice and let me have a drink at the bar while I waited. Luckily, a table opened up outside with a great view. The food came quickly and was really fresh and tasty. The staff were friendly and helpful, too. I definitely recommend M.

The pizza is quite good, nothing too special but definitely a good meal in general.

No real risk of bali belly here which is a relief.

Not really a showstopper but a casual dinner that‚Äôs very, very cheap.","It's really at the most strategic place in Canggu, you can easily find the place, the food is good, the atmosphere and vibes is nice, and the staff is helpful.

But.‚Ä¶as you see in this movie, my last night was a nightmare. The water from the shower leaked into my bedroom for some reason, and I felt that the room was not really well-designed.

You start by picking the type of rice you want.  Then you go to the case where many dishes are prepared and pick the combination you want. There are plenty of meat and vegetarian choices.  They give you generous portions for the price.  All the food I tasted was flavorful and felt like home cooking.  The seating is communal so it‚Äôs not a place to come for a romantic night out.  If I lived here I would be a regular.,"Last night as I was on my way to drop laundry on my motorbike I noticed long lines outside this restaurant. Not just locals, but lots of experts as well - so I made a promise to myself that I will come here for dinner with my family.

15 minutes later, we joined that long queue to see what the fuss was all about. Right from the get-go you can see that it is the food that brings people here, along with the fantastic prices. Once you are in the queue, you keep glancing at the food counter to see what they have on offer, and once you are at the front of the queue, you are immediately inundated with options to choose from.

The first step is to choose your carb( Rice or noodle ), and then choose from a plethora of different vegetarian and protein dishes on display. There was fried chicken,  chicken curry, tempeh and a whole host of different vegetarian options.

Once you have finished giving your order and she has finished plating it on your basket plate, she will give you a small card with the price and you go and pay in the counter.
Finding a place or table is daunting but somehow there's always a seat available. Communal dining is encouraged and I saw a lot of groups chatting with each other over dinner and then leaving after saying their goodbyes.

The food is authentically Balinese - really enjoyed the local vibe and the very chilled out atmosphere of the restaurant. Would definitely recommend this once in your Bali trip","Amazing place to eat. Not only is it approximately half the price of regular restaurants but also you can choose from many delicious choices to create your own dinner.

The resort is a great location, it‚Äôs in walking distance to the beach, restaurants and bars which is so ideal. The WiFi was excellent and they have desk space in the lobby to work which was really good - they also have a meeting room for an extra cost but the lobby was sufficient for me. I would highly recommend this resort in Canggu!","We are just back from 5 wonderful nights at the Eastin Ashta resort.

This was our first time in Canggu and didn't know where to base ourselves. It turns out that the Eastin is perfectly located. Mere steps from the beach and surrounded by excellent restaurants, bars and coffee shops.

The hotel is large, modern, with a fabulous pool area. ""Salt"" pool bar and restaurant is a highlight with an extensive all day menu of food and drinks.

The buffet breakfast was excellent. So many options. The fresh eggs/omelette station is a huge bonus for people like that like to start the day with eggs and toast.

The staff are all great and so friendly.

My feedback would be that there needs to be more shade by the pool area. It is in direct sunlight all day and the parasols are too small to provide effective protection.

All up, highly recommended.","I had a disappointing experience during my recent stay at this hotel, leading to an early departure after just two nights instead of the planned seven. The most distressing issue was the unbearable noise level. A nightclub located next door played music so loudly throughout the night that it felt as though the party was in our very room, rendering sleep impossible for myself and, as I learned from speaking with other guests, many others as well.

In addition to the external noise, the soundproofing within the hotel itself seemed lacking. Ordinary sounds from adjacent rooms, such as people watching TV, were clearly audible, further detracting from the peaceful environment one would expect from a hotel stay.

While the hotel does offer a variety of breakfast options, the quality was underwhelming. The selection, though ostensibly broad, often featured cold items that appeared to have been sitting out for an extended period.

Another significant disappointment was the unannounced shutdown of the pool. Guests, including myself, were only informed of this maintenance closure, scheduled to last over 10 days, the day before it commenced. This lack of advance notice was particularly frustrating and seemed indicative of poor communication and consideration for guests' plans and expectations.

Relocating to another hotel for the remainder of my trip greatly improved my experience. Given these issues, particularly the excessive noise and the lack of timely and effective communication from the hotel management, I cannot recommend staying at this hotel, especially for those seeking a restful and relaxing visit.","This hotel saved my boyfriend and my vacation! After a terrible Airbnb experience we got a room here for 8 nights and we were happy with absolutely everything. Beds are comfortable, cleaning everyday, great pool, and location makes it easy to access anything. The staff even noted it was my boyfriends birthday and decorated our room and gave him cake as a surprise, which was so sweet. We would absolutely stay here again.","Overall, it's a pleasant stay. The hotel is close to the popular F&B places we wanted to try, with fantastic hospitality, a quite big room, and a decent breakfast for those who enjoy Western food. Special shout out to Yudik, Yogi K, and Sidi from the room service team for making cute surprises with towel animals every morning because they saw our animal plush toy!

It was a little disappointing that the pool was suddenly closed during our stay, but the hotel was apologetic and offered compensation, which we are grateful for. However, for those sensitive to noise and lights, be aware that there will be live music on certain days (I think it was twice a week) from a neighboring venue, that is quite loud and has lots of laser-like lights.

I can see why this is a popular spot for those visiting Canggu.","Hungry? Definitely come to Avacado Factory for their very filling breakfasts and at affordable price!
Some dishes are definitely for two people than one. Who doesn‚Äôt love a restaurant that gives us plenty of food to eat?","The best food!! The menu is amazing with SO much choice. I had to visit a few times, the service is great and the portions are massive! Good value for money, but more expensive than local food. Really nice atmosphere and good coffee.","Great atmosphere and really nice interior. I really  liked the design of the restaurant. The color scheme works great in the big open factory-style building.

The staff welcomes the guest very friendly at the entrance and guides you to your table. Service is quick, professional and good.

The menu ist quite simple, normal food as you get in most places in Canggu. Most dishes are somehow Avocado related. That‚Äôs the only weak spot here: the dishes we had were kinda boring. Definitely nothing wrong with them and nicely presented but the taste was not so special.

Drinks were great, really good coffee by the way. You get to choose the coffee blend: either standard blend or authentic Balinese coffee.

All in all definitely a recommendation, thumbs up!","Change of Scenery at The Avocado Factory

For the past few years, my husband and I have made it a tradition to enjoy at least one breakfast at The Avocado Factory whenever we are in Bali. This time, we were surprised to find that The Avocado Factory had moved across the street from its original location. Gone are the serene rice fields that once surrounded it, replaced now by a large, ultra-modern building. Unfortunately, this new setting lacks the cozy charm of the past. The vibe has definitely changed, feeling more ""instagrammable"" and busier. However, the food remains exceptionally delicious! The truffle eggs Benedict, in particular, continues to impress me immensely."

Burrito was delicious.

Nice vegan/vegetarian restaurant.","We went there twice and liked it both times. We tried the avocadotoast with lots of avocado on it which was decent. The Lentil soup and the vegan breakfast burger were good (patty was a bit soft). The salted caramel peanutbutter tarte was delicious! Highly recommend if you like sweets. Drinks were all good.

Luma had been recommend to me by my friends as one of the best restaurants in the Canggu area, and hence had to give this place a try. The restaurant has very spacious and nice interiors. The food menu seems fluid (changing very frequently), but the overall cuisine is more like Italian+Greek+South European. We ordered 3 small dishes, 1 main and 2 desserts which was the perfect amount of food for 2 pax. My favourite was the lamb gnocchi main dish and would definitely recommend folks to try that.

For drinks, they have a decent wine collection as well as a cocktail and non-alcoholic menu. We tried a few cocktails which were quite decent.

Service was really good.

Overall, I‚Äôd definitely recommend a visit to Luma, esp. if you‚Äôre staying in the Canggu area.","I was here for a friend birthday dinner. It was a beautiful meal. space is nice - I am not so much into live music anymore but the singer has a really nice voice.

I think this is a nice place for dinner when you are in Canggu.","Our experience at Luma left much to be desired. Rather than inviting us in with a warm greeting or small conversation, the host spent the whole night passing up and down which made us feel like our every bite was being watched.
The food was notable but very expensive for what it‚Äôs worth. We ended up spending 4.2mil between 4 people which is quite a lot considering we have had much higher quality for cheaper at other notable Canggu restaurants.
Overall, the atmosphere is incredible and the vibe of the venue is stunning however the lack of warmth and service left us quite disappointed. This venue truly has the potential to be incredible so it‚Äôs quite a shame.","Perfect place for a romantic or really nice group dinner. The hospitality in this restaurant is just beyond and is for sure a place to visit over and over again. Th√® restrooms are beautiful and get to take pictures üòÜ The fish and duck were the best!

Only criticism would be the food came out too fast.

We opted for the set menu along with some wines and a few cocktails. While the food was just okay, the overall ambiance of the place was definitely nice.

I wanted to try to try a lot of things so I ordered most of their snacks, and they started to bring everything very quickly so I had to talk to the manager to tell them that they needed to chill and it wasn‚Äôt a race. The way they dealt with the feedback was perfect and the service after that was great. The food is really really good and as a foodie I can say that the chef really knows what he / she is doing. A lot of attention to details, flavours association and originality. Really really good I can only recommend you to give a try! Thanks to all the staff.
Only little thing - it was quite dark upstairs where we were sitting, a bit more light would have been welcome","Got the set menu and it was amazing. The Tuna thing from the snack menu was the highlight of the show; but everything else was at immaculate quality.

The only downside was the table arrangement is a bit awkward üòÇ i had a half circle table and the size is too wide for 2 person to sit across each other, and too close to the next table you could hear their conversation.","Lovely place for dinner, well-decorated restaurant, staffs are very welcome-attentive and friendly.
