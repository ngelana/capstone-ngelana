When you buy food or drink, you can lay down on the sunbeds and relax 🤗

A family business of nice local people, they are always kind and smiling to us 💗
They sell their daily freshly caught fish 🐟🐠🐡and prepare it to your liking 👩🏻‍🍳..if you eat meat, try it ..🤗

We are vegan 🌱 and fish are our friends, no food...😊😅 so we only know from friends..😊 but we were pleasantly surprised that he knows what veganism is...he has no problem modifying food to become vegan 🌱🤗
💛 Mie goreng and Nasi goreng were very good 🤗💛
Every day they have fresh cold coconut 🥥🌴 and fresh fruit juice as well as other cold drinks 😊 After the trip to Atuh it was really a big advantage (tired from the trip to Diamond - from the trip up and down to Atuh 🧗🏻‍♀️ ... Ugh.. 😅)

If you will be in Atuh, you must try it 💛",Very beautiful views with amazingly delicious food and friendly staff😉,The octopus was really tasty !
