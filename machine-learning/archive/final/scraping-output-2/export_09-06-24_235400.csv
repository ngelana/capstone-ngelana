Tegallalang, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80561, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=1610831969129008916,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 721480,zoo,"hotel, zoo, lodging",4.1,3482,,"There are no words to describe the tranquility of this place. The service is top notch. So polite and on top of everything. The activities that you can do here are one in a lifetime experiences that you should definitely participate in. We did the lake bathe with the elephants. Amazing.
When we first got to the park, I was a little upset at 2 things that I saw immediately. Our room looked out into where they eat. The elephants were chained to a pad about 3 times their size. I was mad because I read up to make sure that there was not cruelly to these animals before we stayed there. But after a few days and after watching the documentary about the park, watching the whole journey to get the elephants out of the camp they were in and learned about the park works, it became clear that this was a food aggression safety protocol. You don't want animals of that size fighting over food. So that's they only time they are chained up and obviously chains are required, as a rope just isn't getting it with that size of an animal! I also didn't like the tools that I saw them guiding the elephant with. I had seen the sharp tools that they stick into the elephants head to guide them and made sure they didn't use them. So I addressed one of the guides, and he showed me on his hands that the tool is blunt, and they just tap it on their head as a guide when they don't listen to words.
The elephants seem very happy here, and if you're looking for a paradise to get away from everything, you have definitely found it here.","We visited this place as a tour group ( P&O )
It was amazing, the food was beautiful and very flavourful. The guides were amazing happy to answer questions and friendly of course. The elephants all showed signs of being well looked after and definitely well fed , we got our photos taken and fed them. If you get a chance I say go and visit them. We did not spend the night just the day at the site. But will definitely be returning.  They even had two baby elephants that are currently 4 years old and 4 a half. They walked them up to us and they seemed so happy üòÅ  you get to hand feed them .","Reading the mixed reviews on here made me very skeptical and almost regretted purchasing the tickets completely. I was hesitant to go but decided to do it anyway. The attached picture highlights a lot of the concerns that folks have talked about and I found it that it was alleviating to see in the entrance before you even go into the sanctuary. The elephants do look content and are very interactive with the guests and the handlers. We saw few elephants chained up during feeding time and as the picture describes, that is to prevent fighting and they did not appear to be hurt or discontent during the feeding process. The elephants on rides do not look unhappy either as they are constantly given snacks and are given regular breaks where they can be washed by the guests. The reason for my 4 star review is specifically for the riding aspect as elephants are obviously not made for riding by humans but they are treated well. They are guided with a pointy metal tool if they go in another direction but the handling of that tool did not seem to hurt the elephant.

Staff were friendly, I tipped some but not others. Seems they are eager to please both guests and the elephants and do seem that they are going the extra effort to earn a tip from the guests.

Overall it seems like a good place for these displaced elephants to be.","Me and my partner went to the elephant park on our first trip to bali last week. we had a jumbo wash, bathe and lunch package through our hotel, which we thought was decently priced. however when we got there we were very disappointed. the wash was great! the elephants seemed happy and didnt seem agitated. however as we progressed to the area where they do the feeding , photos and bathe we were pretty disappointed. all of the elephants seemed very distressed and annoyed. we even saw the trainers/ staff hitting the elephants with these metal pick things. as we read apparently it doesn‚Äôt hurt the elephants and is for safety reasons, but we felt like the trainers were using more force than they should have to make the elephants do certain things, ESPECIALLY in the bathe / swim section. this made us extremely uncomfortable and upset so we only did the wash and feed and then left, we also observed staff shoving and like kind of hitting the elephants. not to mention our driver from the company was terrible and made us feel unsafe. overall i wouldn‚Äôt recommend coming here and i just worry these elephants aren‚Äôt treated properly.","After doing some careful research, I decided to spend a full 24 hours at the Mason elephant Park.
I‚Äôm so glad I did! I was able to spend leisurely time walking around the park and interacting with the staff and the elephants. I feel I was well educated by everyone of the staff, and all of the material available on the website prior to my visit.
The park itself is beautifully maintained. The meal I enjoyed in the restaurant was nothing short of five star. The room in the lodge that I stayed in was absolutely lovely and my view from my deck of the elephants at night was incredible.
I loved listening to the sounds of the jungle.
Every experience that I had interacting with the elephants was kind, professional, and it was obvious the staff loved being there. Everyone I spoke to had over a decades worth of working there. I recommend making this part of your educational and inspirational travel journey."

A particular thanks to the villa manager Made, he was always kind and help us organizing activities ( they have discounts) and bringing us to and back to Ubud.

Get to choose the style of ring you wish to make and if you want you may add gem stones to highlight your sliver jewelry. I purchased extra silver to make a bigger ring and my wife chose a ruby to give an extra shine to her ring. From melting silver to hammering out the shape, we had hands on experience of making our own personal jewelries. If you want to spend your afternoon in a quiet tranquil surroundings making jewelry for your loved ones can make your stay in Bali more meaningful.","Me and my boyfriend did the silver making workshop as it was raining so much the day we went so it was the perfect thing to do to pass some time and we came away with lovely personal souvenirs.

When we arrived we hadn‚Äôt made a booking and they were very accommodating, explained everything and brought us complimentary tea and sweet sticky rice snacks!
We were then given pencil & paper to design our rings (can also make other things too) then given any necessary adjustments to the design according to what would be possible/ look best.
There was also a selection of gems and crystals if you want to incorporate into your design at a very small extra cost (10-15k)
It‚Äôs a hands on class and the guys explain what you need to do at each step and completely guide you through it.

We were there about 3.5 hours, we didn‚Äôt feel rushed at all and really felt like they cared that we were completely happy with our creations. It was very dark when we left the class and they kindly guided us back to our scooter with torches which was a nice touch.

Overall amazing experience, thank you!
Would definitely come back üòä","The ring making session was great, a must for travellers in Ubud. The team were friendly, knowledgeable and very welcoming. We made 5 rings between two of us (14g silver), including some specialist designs which the team helped us make without complaint. Would highly recommend!","We did silver class with yande,  and it was great,  the instructor very helpful and also friendly,  i did ring and my gf did  earing
And we loved the jewelries and we also order some jewelries with them.  They are so talended
Thank you",This was a great class and experience to get into the some Bali culture. The class was fun and the jewelry turned out beautiful! Our guide helped a lot. Definitely recommend!

We tried 2 salads, the food was fresh and very tasty. Would definitely recommend having a bite to eat here. The restaurant opens on the 12th December.

Good foods and drinks , highly recommend will come again","Cozy place, cool atmosphere, many choices of refreshing cocktails. Not only that, the pizza is also very tempting and appetizing. I'm sure I will visit again","Terrible Pizza, extremely disappointed. Why would you put something on the Menu that you make so badly?? They said that there would be Shrimp, squid and fish on their seafood pizza.

There was barely 2 pieces of shrimp cut up on the pizza, no Calamari or fish. The shrimp was not even skinned and still had the tail and shell on!! Cheese not melted, sauce tasted old, and the pizza base was a store bought base that was like a crumbling biscuit. Terrible, worst Pizza I've ever had.

Ordered a milkshake and the glass was 3/4th Ice chunks, could barely stir the drink, and was left with a watered down drink which when I finished, looked like a glass full of 3 huge pieces of ice. definitely not worth the trip. Please rather visit another nearby lowkey cafe than be fooled by the ambience here."

The facilities were clean and comfortable, and the staff was friendly and accommodating. The location was also convenient, with plenty of nearby attractions and activities to enjoy.

The room I stayed in was spacious and well-appointed with a comfortable bed, good air conditioning, and a reliable Wi-Fi connection. The bathroom was also clean and well-maintained.

The location of Ondokhouse was perfect for me, with plenty of nearby restaurants and shops within walking distance. It was also easy to arrange transportation to nearby attractions such as the Tegallalang Rice Terraces and the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary.

The staff at Ondokhouse was particularly friendly and helpful, providing recommendations for things to do and see in the area. They even helped me arrange a day trip to explore some of the nearby temples and waterfalls.

Overall, I would give my stay at Ondokhouse a rating of four stars. While there were a few minor issues, the overall experience was excellent and I would definitely recommend it to others. I plan on returning to Bali in the future and would definitely consider staying at Ondokhouse again.","Truly a hidden gem in Bali. Ondokhouse is located in Taro village which still preserves the Balinese traditional culture. The most easiest thing to see is that all of the houses are built following rules of ‚Äòsikut satak‚Äô. They are majestic! The airbnb is one of them also, you can live with the friendly local here and explore more about unique Balinese culture. I had chance to observe the ‚Äòcanang sari‚Äô practice in the morning and the Kulkul sound from the temple right in front of the house every afternoon. And many things more about the daily life in this old village.
About things to enjoy, there is a beautiful ricefield just a few walk from here (it has fireflies at night!!!) And Semara Ratih Delodsema Village is very near, its restaurant is excellent with stunning view looking down to the jungle and river. You can also trek down to the river and do some picnic. And it takes only 30m to Ubud and Tirta Emple if you need some tourist vibes. There are many waterfalls along the way also, I recommend Tukad Cepung Waterfall.
The house is fully equipped with AC, TV and bathtub. All in good condition. I booked 5 nights and about to move to Ubud but decide to stay here the rest of my vacation. The price is reasonable compared to what it offers. The local food around is very cheap also, you can buy breakfast named ‚Äòbubur bali‚Äô with only 2k idr.",Beautiful and cozy place! We supposed to stay only for 2 nights but my bf and I enjoyed so much the village and the hospitality of the owner so we ended up more nights . Thank you for welcoming us and we hope you will have more guest.,"this place is authentic and a real gem! Kadak and her family are the sweetest, and will do anything to make your stay special. She's carried me around temples, rice terraces and much more, upon request and without any extra cost. They've also invited me to a local ceremony which was a unique experience. The place is sparkling clean and immersed in the nature. I highly recommend it!","Simple, cozy and authentic experience. Kadek (host) is helpful.
