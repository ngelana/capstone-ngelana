It was our first time white water rafting. But we made it. Rapids near enough from start to finish.  Our guide, Ricky was awesome too! Highly recommended","Fun and beautiful, excellent guides.",Super fun experience! Very friendly guides who gave clear instructions. This is a good place to start white water rafting if you're a complete beginner.  There's a meal afterwards which is included with the ticket. The towels are provided and there are a number of changing rooms you can use.,"This was by far one of the best experiences we have had on our honeymoon in Bali!! So exhilarating, so exciting and a huge laugh with lots of smiles. Great fun and guides made the adventure even better !! Food at the end was awesome !!! So yummy
Please do this adventure you will regret if you don't!!",We had good fun.
