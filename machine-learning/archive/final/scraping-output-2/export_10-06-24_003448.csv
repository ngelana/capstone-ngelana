Great place, far from the chaos, noise and pollution but close to plenty of beautiful places.
The family owning the place is amazing. Always kind and extremely helpful. We did some tours with them, they are very knowledgable about the area and the history of Bali and Indonesia. Totally recommendable.","It was the best our place of living in the authentic Bali. This place is family-owned and the whole family contribute to this cozy place by their soul and passion. The whole range of typical services are represented here - swimming pool, European and local food, excursions, massage. You even may not leave a hotel if you want. Also, very quiet. Definitely authentic Bali as I imagined it.","Without a doubt, the highlight of our trip was staying at this hotel. From the moment TJ picked us up from the airport, sparing us the hassle of dealing with taxi drivers, to experiencing the breathtaking beauty of the location, every aspect exceeded our expectations. TJ's guidance throughout our stay was exceptional, adding depth and insight to our experience. We wholeheartedly recommend this establishment; it's not just a place to stay, but a family-run oasis where every detail, from the stunning property to the delectable food, is meticulously crafted to ensure an unforgettable experience.","Rooms are like new, clean, spacious and comfortable.
Location is a bit away from hustle and a perfect place to relax. At the same time, many waterfalls and other attractions are located nearby.
Managed by family who are very warm and quite helpful. They also guide us on visiting nearby attractions.
Bike rent available but inform them in advance as it is in limited numbers. Transportation to Mt.Batur along with guide was arranged. Mr.Teja drove us to Mt.Batur and also accompanied us which really added up for great trek and overall experience.
Food was freshly prepared and they prepared it as per our customisation.
Cappuccino at Chris Cafe, which is an in-house cafe, was perfect.","Feels like home!
This is our favorite stay in Bali by far!

It‚Äôs a very relaxing place, outside the busy tourist areas in Bali, but central to make excursions to wherever you like.
The place has a beautiful garden, swimming pool, pond, outside gym, cozy bar (with sometimes Jazz music),‚Ä¶
The rooms are big, clean, good shower, comfortable bed, outside terrace/living area, the internet is fast to work and do videocalls. The staff is friendly.
I could easily live here for a month. It doesn‚Äôt feel like a hotel/resort.
If we come back to Bali we will defenitely want to stay here again!"

After weeks of running around in Bail, this super-peaceful place in rural Bangli was just what I needed to put my soul at rest. The barista makes awesome coffees, the spaghetti is the best in Bali, the staff is ridiculously friendly, and the bartender is JUST ADORABLE! I‚Äôm definitely going back soon!!!","My favourite place in East Bali.  When I travel I‚Äôm always looking to get off the tourist trail and discover secret places to call my own.  When I was on my way to Kintamani, I saw a sign for Chris Cafe and decided to check it out.  When I turned off the main road, I drove through a very humble Balinese village so I wasn‚Äôt expecting much.  But when I got to the end of the village, I came to a gate which opened into Chris‚Äô beautiful property (what a shock). The food, coffee and cocktails were just as good as any place in Ubud, but the friendly service was far better than you could ever find in the city.  I highly recommend this place to anyone trravelling up the east side of the island.","Great little gem of a pool bar tucked away at the end of an unpaved road in the middle of nowhere. It's part of a hotel, so there is always someone around in case you're wondering whether it will be open. The coffees are great, the staff is lovely and very attentive, me and my kids loved it there!","Chris Cafe is a great place to go to relax with your friends or family when you want to get away from the noise and craziness of the city.  It‚Äôs maybe not as ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù as a resto in Ubud, Seminyak or Canggu, but it‚Äôs a beautiful little spot tucked away in an authentic Balinese village, surrounded by the sounds of ‚Äúbirds‚Äù instead of ‚Äúcars.‚Äù  They have a small pool with about 8 lounge chairs + a charming little bar serving cappuccinos, wine, beer and great cocktails + some delicious western and Balinese home cooking which you can enjoy in seating areas scattered around the grounds.  We‚Äôll definitely visit Chris‚Äô again when we return to Bali and are looking to spend some quiet time away from the crowds.  A real hidden gem."

They picked us up by car at the hotel and brought us to the house, where everything was already prepared and ready to start cooking. The organisation was outstandingüëè

They welcomed us with a delicious turmeric drink, rice tea and typical Balinese pancakes. We cooked most of the recipes book and we even helped processing the coconut oil. It was such an enriching experience, and the food we prepared was delicious and easy to cook when we are back at home! We ate with the cooks together and then he brought us back to the hotel! 110% recommended!üòÉ","Today we had the most incredible experience at the Selera Cooking Class in Bangli, Bali! From start to finish, it was a culinary adventure that I'll cherish forever.

The day began with a visit to the local market, where our knowledgeable guide, Sudi,  introduced us to the vibrant world of Balinese ingredients. It was fascinating to learn about the fresh herbs, spices, and produce that make Balinese cuisine so unique.

Back at Selera, we had the privilege of using ingredients straight from their own garden, enhancing the authenticity of our dishes. The lush surroundings and serene atmosphere added to the overall charm of the experience.

What truly set this cooking class apart was the variety of original and authentic Balinese recipes we prepared. From Jukut Kuah to mouthwatering Sate Lilit, each dish was a delightful journey into the heart of Balinese gastronomy. The patient and skilled Sudi guided us every step of the way, making sure we understood the techniques and traditions behind each recipe.

The highlight for me was not just cooking these delicious dishes but also sitting down to enjoy the feast we had prepared together. It was a true celebration of Balinese culture and flavors.

I can't recommend Selera Cooking Class enough. This experience is a must for anyone visiting Bali. It's a beautiful blend of culinary education, cultural immersion, and unforgettable memories. Thank you, Selera, for a day I'll forever cherish!","We were there on a private cooking class. We had been picked up from our hotel, then we went to the typical balinese market, private garden with vegetables and then to family house of Wayan. He is very nice person, very communicative with good English. He told us a lot of history of Bali. At the place whole family was helping with our lesson, all of them were very nice and kind. We prepared 6 dishes and then we composed our meal of them. Everything we made in eco friendly manner from eco products. It was very delicious! We also saw how the coconut oil was made. Wayan is real passionate of cooking and driving and we can recommend him as a tour guide or cooking teacher for everyone who is really interested in Balinese culture!","Not only did they pick us up and drop us off after, they brought us to the market, showed us how to find and choose all the ingredients we would be working with and then brought us to a beautiful outdoor kitchen space to teach us authentic Balinese cooking. We learned how they make coconut oil and even got to help in the process before being taught step by step how to make several popular dishes. We were able to take the recipe guide from those dishes with us and even buy some coconut oil made on location! Such a welcoming family and of course eating the food we prepared was delicious and filling. Highly recommend!","This was a super nice surprise. Price is sharp, food is great and the hospitality even more so.
Great English guide wayan, that picks you up from your hotel to introduce to his family.
Together with the family you cook in a traditional Balinese way, and there is time to play some traditional Balinese music. Super activity, absolutely recommend!"
