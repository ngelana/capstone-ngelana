The camping van was super cosy, making our stay incredibly comfortable. Surrounded by breathtaking nature, we felt completely immersed in Bali‚Äôs beauty. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating, ensuring we had everything we needed. Seeing Bali from this unique perspective was truly unforgettable. Highly recommend! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚Äù","We stayed in the van for a week and had a terrific experience! Yoga was amazing to work with and helped us throughout our entire trip with the van, when needed. I hope in the future Bali gets more campgrounds, as we didn‚Äôt stay in one area more than a day- but in the meantime yoga is very helpful in finding places to stay. Also, HIGHLY recommend the krisna campspot in the Lovina area!!! It was 85k for us to camp there but beautiful location on the beach with good bathrooms, and showers as well as access to a wonderful pool!!! This was by far our favorite campsite!","Kudos PukuCamper team! Overall I'm satisfied with the services that puku team provided. The staffs are really helpful and always ensure that I'm in the good condition while using their car. If u planned a trip to Bali and using  a campervan. Using pukuCamper is a must!

P.s a little photo during my trip to tamblingan lake using PukuCamper","PukuCamper is awesome way to more experience Bali. The hosts are very kind and warm and were available to offer suggestions for where to go, or when in need of help ask questions. We slept great in the camper, it had everything we needed. We highly recommend it to get adventurous in beautiful island Bali. We will definitely do it again!",You should try this campervan when visiting Bali! This was our second trip with Puku üòç The van is durable for any type of road. The facilities is quite complete. The crew is friendly and helpful. This is the different cool way to explore Bali Island.
