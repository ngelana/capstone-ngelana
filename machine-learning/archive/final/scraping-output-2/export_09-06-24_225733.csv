Wonderful sceneries around. Upon arriving, walk down a 300m path closed to car due to road restoration. Walk towards a tall water mill with round windmill at top. Quite a big plantations for good photography and short filming. Friendly staff might tacked along to introduce the place. Goats and cow around. Avoid raining days as walking path not paved and will be slippery. Enjoy the beautiful marigolds!!!","This is what I found while trying to come to Bali Gemitir/Marigold Field using my Google Navigation. We come 1,5 hour from Ubud to get here by Scooter. And maybe lil bit unfortunate for us that we are about to get soak by the rain since the weather is unstable yesterday. Funny thing is, we came all the way here like in the middle of nowhere in the jungle, we don‚Äôt see any single person around. And the most funny is, we, me & my BF think that we are going to meet the other travelers in this place and so that‚Äôs why we confidently kept driving toward the point. And our Navigation is pointing to here. Anyway,  it was fun adventures for us, although we didn‚Äôt get to the exact field that everybody else is. We still got the chance to selfie with this beauty Marigold flower üòÅ",No note about the flower season so when we went there it was closed,üë£üçÉ,Amazing Flower
