Just a suggestion, if you can be cleaner in processing food or serving food to customers.
And if you don't provide plastic bags, provide customers with more environmentally friendly bags or paper bags... It will not reduce your profit in selling food.

A friend of mine recommended this warung to me, saying that it was one of the very best local warungs that sells Nasi Campur Bali (Bali Mixed Rice), where the local people go to.

She has warned me that there will be some queue, but she didn't tell me that it would each person on the queues could order like 5-40packs lol üòÇ.

Anyway, the queue wasn't too long and since it is still on new normal, so less people dine in. But I honestly can't imagine how pack it will be during the normal days lol.

They have so many topping to choose. You could choose the topping by yourself or just tell the ladies there, the amount that you wanna purchase (15K, 25k, 35k) and they will pick them for you.

The taste was super yummy, one of our fave warungs now. Portion was big and complete, price was very affordable (the food on the picture cost 35K), place was spacious and clean.

When I told about this warung to another local friend here, she said she loves the food as well lol.

A must try!","Affordable and delicious. Great taste of Balinese nasi campur ayam. If you like spicy food, then this is the right choice. It can be queuing during lunch time.","I ordered a very basic nasi campur which I would get all over Bali for between 10k to 15k . They charged me 25k.

The mactha is perfect with sweet, milky and bitter. And their pain au chocolat also nice, with lot of chocolate, fresh and affordable.

I order it for takeaway cause i‚Äôm in rush. But i love their place. Such a nice vibes, clean, simple and also for taking afternoon coffee or breakfast there.","Coffee shop in the neighborhood; affordable and nice coffee and pastry, adequately service.

I tried Sandat coffee 7.5/10 and Chocolate Danish 7/10, forget to ask for less sugar.

Tookaways Chocolate Danish and Cinnamon Raisin rolls.

7/10 Wifi.

7.5/10 backyard seatings with no electric socket.

Would love to come back anytime soon. ‚òï","Nice coffee shop at the corner of Suli street. Surprisingly the taste of their signature Latte Warga was nice, like it. It tasted different from other latte. Wifi and power socket are available, love their seating layout facing the street. Parking space is quite spacious for couple of motorbikes and cars. Good.","Decided to have lunch at this place. The ambiance reminds me of grandma's backyard with lots of greenery and cozy seating. They share the space with Dapoer Pemuda. My friend and I had Nasi Bakar Ayam and Ayam Bakar at their restaurant. The presentation is basic, but the taste is very good! Not so crowded nor tourist-y. Very convenient to chill and gather with friends and family. Price wise is still reasonable with 15% tax and service. Everything is just worth it. Look forward to visiting this place again.","Worth a visit if in the area. Enjoyable coffee and a relaxed atmosphere out back. The front part of the shop is far too noisy with traffic to have a chat.
Attempted to get a shot of espresso in the passion fruit soda but failed in the request and ended up with a separate shot on the side. The food from the connected restaurant looks nice."

Love come to eat here, definitely will back again",Soto taste delicious but quite pricey for warung.  The atmosphere is like dine in rest area pantura or somewhere in Java road trip.,Many choises of indonesian food. Price fair. Taste fair.. nothing special,Tastes good. There's a lot variety of Indonesian cuisine. But the food is so pricey. Recommended for family dining. Not really recommended for hang out spot.
