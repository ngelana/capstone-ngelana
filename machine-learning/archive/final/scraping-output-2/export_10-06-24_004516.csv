There are tents just at the lap of the nature. There are many coconut trees around and we have met many other foreigners.

Kadek & his girlfriend are really a very good host. Highly recommended if you are going Bali, must stay it visit this place.
You will also learn about organic farming and a lot about Balinese culture.","Stayed at Tegal project in the first week of June...Enjoyed a lot with Kadek & his family..if you like nature and countryside then you will fall in love with this place. We did yoga, played games, went to waterfalls, and explored the real Bali.

I wish all the best for organic farming project. Recommended for backpackers & nature seekers.","Great people who are giving a lot for the future of the children in the small villages.
The new Must-see place in Bali when u enjoy staying away from tourists!
If you are lucky you get the chance to see west Bali with its beautiful temples and beaches :) if you are not lucky with that you are still lucky because this place Is amazing to chill, to learn about the Balinese culture and how to cook :D",What an incredible place to visit! Kadek and his family were very welcoming and showed me many amazing places that I wouldn't have ever known about. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to experience the true beauty of Bali and learn about Balinese culture!,"The best things what happened to me, it's happened in Tegal Project! I spend almost 1 month with this amazing family and enjoy with the every moment ü§ó cause i always feels like i'm in my own house‚ù£Ô∏èwords are not enough to explain my experience and feelings, but actually the most important thing that i learn in Tegal Project words, colors and languages are meaningless. I miss you guys every minute and pretty sure i will back to my home againüôè Loves and kisses üòò"
