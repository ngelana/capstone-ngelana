We brought games with the intention of hanging out for a while.  We very much enjoyed our time.  Love all the space to work, play, and hangout.

We were welcomed and continued to receive friendly customer service throughout.

We went a little overboard and ordered an almond croissant, a chocolate croissant, a pistachio roll, and a cinnamon roll — it’s recon for our future visits!  I also ordered an iced coconut latte (they use oat milk and don’t think they offer substitutes) — I personally love oat milk so this is a win for me.

The pastries were all quality and I liked my latte, as well.  I think the winner for us was the chocolate croissant.  They have a fairly extensive menu so I think we’ll be back to try more items.

Thanks for a pleasant time!","Great coffee and pastries:) The only downside is a lot of russians visiting this place, and behaving too loud. But it’s not the cafe’s fault. The place is really good.","We love this bakery so much, from good coffee to nice brunch and we love the pain au chocolat there or croissants, good wifi and the place is really comfy to work a little or read something, treat is really good by workers, a must visit if you are around","At a first sight it was perfect: each time I made my own breakfast but today i was truly disappointed about the cooking methods used. Scrambled was made with garlic which specifically I do not wanna see in my breakfast plate, the tuna was too in mayo.

I’d recommend coffee and pastry, not sure about the rest now…","The aroma of freshly ground coffee beans creates a comforting atmosphere. If you're looking for a quiet spot to work, the ambiance here at Nectar strikes the right balance between serene and vibrant.

Not just the ambience, but the coffee here is really good too! p.s u should try their coconut latte to make u feel the vibe of Bali :)"

We ended stopping here late one afternoon to grab a bite but ended up feeling like we were among friends and family and stayed well past dark. The staff were so friendly and chill which gave it a very welcoming and easy going vibe - even the other regulars at the restaurant were friendly and we ended up having a few beers and some whiskey with complete strangers.

The food was good, the friendly dogs lying around the restaurant made it cozy, and the music at night made for a fun time. I’ll definitely return if I’m ever in the area again."

Of the minuses, it is worth noting the remoteness from the shops and the small number of rooms with a double bed.

I definitely enjoyed this place compared to others, where I paid double. The staff were lovely, communication was great through WhatsApp.","What a stange experience...

From the beggining we were slightly confused. We arrived late, around 12am and asked if we were the only people staying here. We were told yes, that we are alone in the place.

As we walked in to the small house i noticed immediately that there was a basement in the room, which seemed strange. When we were left alone i checked it out, and found a strange set up of a childs bedroom fully equipped with items and clothes labelled Number 1. There was also a second locked room labelled number 2.

We explored more and when we went to go outiside the front door we realised it had locked itself, the key wouldnt work in the door. Lucky there was a second door which we could open, but the lock wouldnt shut on it.

There were flip flops outside the second door... Leaving us to think we wernt alone.

Later in the night we heard noises outside our room in the kitchen, and in the morning someone was in the kitchen cooking.

We never saw anyone, but saw the kitchen had been used, and heard noises the whole time we were there.

The room and bathroom were clean, and reasonably well looked after.

The water from the shower was only cold, and the installment of the shower head was hilarious, shooting water at the opposite wall.

Over all an interesting stay trying to convince myself we were alone, even though everything seemed to point to otherwise.","It's nice to be able to rest peacefully from the hustle and bustle of the city, good management, friendly staff, thank you for providing the best service.",Nice stay for rest and disconnect from outer world.

First and last time we stayed here. They gave us the dungeon. Staircase was almost to narrow to walk down with our backpacks. No window, in the basement. Smell so horrible that I went to the receptionist and asked for another room. He wanted to charge more for an upgrade. I said no. He offered me flavored spray and laughed. So rude!

The smell is so bad that I had headache and felt sick.

The scooter was life threatening. The acceleration stuck at full speed and we couldn’t stop the scooter anymore. Nearly had an accident. They speak really bad English and didn’t pick up the phone the first 30 min. So was hard to get an replacement scooter. The new scooter had no number plate in the back and in general an expired registration. Breaks bad as well. What a disaster.","Nice place near GWK.
