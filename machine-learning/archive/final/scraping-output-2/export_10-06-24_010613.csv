Can't say a lot, gelato was really good def come here if you want some great gelato!","I think this is the most popular gelato in Bali. I've been following their growth since they were a small gelato shop in Umalas. They have so many uncommon flavors, and some of them are really unique and hard to find anywhere else, like white apple, kemangi, white mango, etc. The branch in Denpasar was also crowded the last time I went, which shows that they're popular with both tourists and locals. I think the taste depends on the flavor, but I like their gelato better than Massimo's.",Just a perfect spot to enjoy summer! The gelato is super authentic with a very deli taste! Worth to try!

Better to order in bulk upfront to avoid the cooking time. Cause if you want to reorder and they run out of the crispy pork, it will a up to 30-minutes wait all over again.

Please note - cause it‚Äôs very important -  due to limited seating, you cant do any reservations in advance. You can't ask the staff to provide extra space especially if you come with a large group.

But on top of it all, but the food won't let you down.","This is one of the best Balinese signature roasted Pork Belly. We really loved their crispy pork skin, with tender and juicy meat. The well seasoned pork and chicken satay are tasty too. They provide packages and ala carte menu, along with the price info, so no need to worry about tourist price scams.
First, we ordered and paid at the cashier, then wait at our table to be served. They'll call our number and bring it to us.
We ordered  Nasi Campur Special, with additional Samsam Merekak, Urutan (a bit similar to a pork sausage), Pork and Chicken Satay.
It is an outdoor seating area and they provide parking spaces too. Although a bit hidden from the main road, don't be surprised with the long queue during lunch hour, reserved recommended or just come earlier.
I waited around half an hour for a fresh pork roasted menu, since we arrived after lunch hour.  However, it is really worth the wait, we made a pre order and tried the tasty coffee while waiting.
The staff are very friendly and helpful, they let me take video of the grilling or roasted process. Overall the service is excellent.
If you happen to be in Bali for a family holiday, I suggest you try this place to add to your ""must try"" list of Bali traditional cuisine.","When come here best to reserve first, because it has long queue. Avoid lunch hour, it could be really crowded, and the place is quite small.

The satay is good, the sausage is okay, sambal is üëçüëçwish they give more, need to pay extra. I try order the soup, but it was soldout.

Tried the Nasi Campur Spesial and honestly it's one of the best Nasi Campur Babi Gulings I've tasted. Super succulent pork, the meat is juicy yet tender, overall very flavorful. I suggest coming here early (after they opened) as the Nasi Campur ran out pretty quick. Worth. Every. Penny.","Best of best samsam guling. If you would like to try all of their menu, you can just order Nasi Campur Komplit. The price is reasonable, the food fresh and i love the ambience here. Nice service from the staff. Oh!

When I asked to change rooms, I was lied to and told that there were no more spacious rooms available. I was only able to stay in a room with a double bed. I was forced to accept this, but fortunately, I received good service from the other staff members. Even though I was not in the room I wanted, I overall found the hotel to be habitable and not disappointing.",I can said that this place have a very big room for that price. A clear water and hot water for bath but no heater for boiling some coffee in the room. The bad idea is this place in front of the school so not recommended for stay cation because in the morning till afternoon this place is noisy. Not recommended for the breakfast because it is only simple breakfast on a food paper. The menu always same (yellow rice).,"Clean comfortable and reasonably priced, in the heart of Renon near to kantor immigrasi and embassies and a short ride into Denpasar city centre, no restaurant at the hotel but walking distance to Plaza Renon and the many restaurants on Jalan Merdeka.","Their service are good. Their staff are kind, friendly & responsive.
But the breakfast not okay. Only got a rice box.
The room is okay. not bad. But it doesn't have a wardrobe. So we have to keep the clothes in our baggage.
And don't expect so much for the view.
But it worth of value.","near to the city, i am travelling with my parents, the lift is out of service and hotel gave us 3rd floor. Air Conditionaing not working very well, then need to move to other room."

This might shook you but all of their menu cost no more than 30k, yep it's so affordable. If you're looking for authentic local snack, I will recommend to look no other than this place.","I love the charm of this place which is full of green space. They had a lovely vibe and the music was not loud so I could actually have a conversation with everyone on the table.  I am sure I will be back again.

A good group of 5 of us did the fabulous brunch. We had such a good time. Every dish we ordered here was superb especially their singkong salju ü§å‚ú®Ô∏è
They have a nice variety and plenty of food to go around ( sharing plates )
I like the fact that we don't have to make a reservation to sit in the semi outdoor seating garden.

All the staff here were so nice and made us feel at home. If you are looking for a really good all around sociable fabulous brunch, look no further, definitely  recommend Gula Bali !","Nice place to enjoy balinese food, lots of vegan friendly options. Their es teler durian, bubur campur, and tipat cantok are really good! Highly recommended. The only downside is their seats are not comfortable enough, the chair is too high, and so many ants everywhere. Still a good place to chill and enjoy indonesian and balinese dessert. The staffs are helpful, quick service.","A hideout in Denpasar, cozy & shadyüëåüèº
Variety of vegetarian options, coupled with fresh fruit juices.
Reckon anyone to try it out and chill there.","Food: 3 stars. I don't understand the food really. We ordered 3 snacks from their specials and recommended on the menu. They're really below our expectation. They need to do much better than this.

Service: 3 stars. Not that they annoy me or anything it's just they're not very welcoming.

Place: 3.5 stars. No sound ambience, under the roof seems to be a bit dark, but the table outside, in the garden is pretty breezy and nice to eat under the shade of trees."

The portion was huge, too. Would definitely return.","I definitely prefer betutu here than the other famous one on the other side of the street. So much more flavourful. But fair warning it is VERY spicy, even for someone who likes spicy food myself. The price is kinda pricy though"

I love the beef soup and the variations of condiments that you can choose to add to the soup.

The place is not that big and on certain times you may need to wait to get a seat. It is clean and like your other typical warung.

Service was ok but when I was there recently the server mixed up orders a couple of time"
