Lovely cafe overlooking the waterfall. Relatively easy hike to get to. Toilet access as well. You can hike back the way towards Red Coral Waterfall or there is an option to go right up to the road if you did not drive there on your own.,"This is a wonderful, privately owned waterfall and can be easily visited from the car park, or like we did from Red Coral waterfall (send me a message if you want to do all 4 in the area for any advice). Entry is free and a donation can be made. I‚Äôd recommend bete week 10-50k per person. There‚Äôs an eco cafe so you can have some food and drink with a view of the fall. Such a lovely and peaceful place!!","My favourite place in Munduk! The staff are so friendly, the cafe looks right over the waterfall and is just so beautiful and peaceful! I had lak lak and it was absolutely delicious and the Bali coffee is strong just the way I like it! Entry to the waterfall is by donation, I could easily spend hours there just watching the waterfall ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Prices are so reasonable too, don't miss it","Free entry but plenty of places to donate money which is good, you feel more happy about paying like this. We were told there are 5 waterfalls along this route which take about 3 hours to complete, but we only managed 1 because we were short on time.","I started my afternoon hike to the waterfalls here. There is a path connecting this waterfall to Red Coral and Labuhan Kebo waterfalls, all the way to Melanting waterfall and then you can continue on a path to Munduk village. There are a few small places to eat (and buy water/spices) along the way, but I was especially happy to eat at the little Warung next to Golden Valley waterfalls."

The location is magnificent as overlooks the jungle. It‚Äôs also very easy to walk to the four waterfalls from the hotel. The staff is very friendly and the foid is delicious. Even while we were in fog and rain one afternoon, the Botanist is a lovely place to hang out.
Definitely worth staying.","Had a wonderful 2-night get-away! The tent is super cozy, the shared bathroom & showers were always clean, its great for trekking to various waterfalls, all the staff is so lovely & friendly and last but not least: all the food at their restaurant ‚Äûthe botanist‚Äú was absolutely delicious!! (Try the cauliflower wings!) They even have books, board games and a cozy fire place at the restaurant (+super nice music in the background). I can highly recommend desa eko ","Had a wonderful stay here!! The glamping was top-notch, the tents were super clean and cozy & the fridge was loaded with beers and other drinks free of chargeüôèüèº the morning views of the jungle outside of our tent door were such a vibe! Would highly recommend üî•

ig: @mattremblay_","Great place, lovely staff who was beyond adorable with our daughter. View is exceptional and the restaurant is very enjoyable.

Please note that there are some steep steps up and down even between restaurant and rooms. The tents will also be cold at night, warm at day. The shared facilities were extremely clean and the warm shower was truly warm. Restaurant is very good too and the wine options are extremely decent. My husband even said he had the best hash browns of his life.

A couple of suggestions to maybe make the place even better:
- add a torch in the rooms for night bathroom breaks
- more water per room (gets a bit tricky to go all the way back up when you run out)
- include the waterfall entrance fees in the daily excursions (we were a bit short in cash and weren‚Äôt expecting to pay more than what was on the brochure).
- maybe a small fan for when it gets very hot, we had an afternoon nap after hiking and woke up very very warm","A cool experience overall. Loved the site and concept of an eco community, however for the price we paid it felt over valued. This includes the tent and food / drinks at the restaurant. We didn‚Äôt have too much choice other than eating there because of weather and location. Wi-fi only worked ~50% of the time we stayed there.
Although we do have to shout out amazing Rico! We participated in the sunrise and local immersion tour, which was faultless. Rico gave us an exceptional experience that we will cherish always."

The vibe‚Äôs so relaxing, really love the atmosphere here. And the foods were also amazing, they have couple of vegan options, everything is good, tasty, big portion, and worth the price. Perfect place to chill and hang out with friends even it‚Äôs a good place to find some inspiration.","Edit from night 2:
We went for dinner a second time here and it was even more disappointed.
I had the veggie bolognese (added chicken) the lentil balls were so dry, there was barely any sauce in the dish, and the pasta had no flavor. I even asked my bf to try and he agreed.
He had the Cajun chicken burger, it was served without the described cheddar cheese, and the bun was not toasted either; we both agreed that it also lacked flavor, it had no spice at all.
It‚Äôs a shame because the ingredients do taste fresh but the overall meal is tasteless. So those are 3 main dishes we have tried that really fall short of description and expectation. For the price paid, it‚Äôs not fair.

However we had the passion truffle and choc/nut bar for dessert and those were yummy!

Review night 1:
Cozy, charming place, great deco and very friendly and knowledgable staff!
Sweet place for a date with the fire pit, cards and games available.
We had the Mezze platter (photo; generous for a sharing platter and very tasty), Malbec, the pepperoni and tartufina pizzas. We wanted the cheese fondue but it was not available (we arrived at 8pm).
Everything was great except the tartufina pizza.
Was quite disappointed as it had no truffle in it at all (which is the point of a tartufina pizza), barely any parmesan, and the dough was not thoroughly cooked. It was mostly dough, some tomato sauce, mushrooms and an egg.
Overall lovely though and will probably come again!","Beautiful cafe, stunning view, a lot of vegan options. Would love to come back.","We came here for lunch. Food was good but nothing special, it was made of fresh ingredients which is nice. View is amazing and they have some boardgames for guests.
Although there were not many people when we ate there, the waiting time was hilarious‚Ä¶ They told me they don‚Äôt have the dish I picked so I asked for a few minutes to decide on another. I was waiting for 20 minutes at least when they came back to take my order. By the time my husband already got his food so we had to eat separately‚Ä¶ it was not a pleasant experience to be honest (no apologies, nothing).",Amazing hidden jewel

Food and coffee were delicious and the staff were amazing, I was the only person there which was great. Also, a bonus thing you have waterfall right underneath you. Great job guys!!!!","Very quiet, not very busy, possibly to enjoy the waterfall with little other tourist. Staff are very friendly.

Unlike the other waterfalls here only a donation is asked for visiting the waterfall.",Wonderful spot for good food at low prices with spectacular views of the waterfall. Very friendly service. You can also buy spices and the luwak coffee here.,"Had to hike down for a little while, might be little challenging for some people who never went on a hike but it‚Äôll be worth it once you reach and get a nice view of the waterfall and get some nice coffee and food. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to the elderly and people bringing infants though, but if you‚Äôre looking for a nice little hike down to a waterfall cafe then this is the place to go. The food overall was good and the price is standard.","Cozy cafe looking out to Golden Valley waterfall. You can rest and enjoy the fresh air, good coffee and snacks here. Friendly owners are local residents, they showed us the vanilla plants growing in their beautiful garden, amongst the coffee trees. Thanks very much, pak!"

They have good local food, tea and coffee, and made me a vegetarian version of their nasi goreng, a must-try!

I even came back the day after for daydreaming and quiet reading.

Make sure to donate to support the area and preserve the beauty of the space.",We made a little stop here after the golden waterfall and it was very charming.
