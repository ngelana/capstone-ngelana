Lovely rooms and beautiful pool area. Staff were so friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend staying here.,"We stayed 3 nights here, it is one of our favourite places to stay, the room is very clean and the host is welcoming and very helpful!! We can’t recommend staying here enough, we will definitely be back! It is close to the beach and food places but also peaceful for a good nights sleep. The breakfast was delicious.","Can only agree with all the four and five star reviews on here. Comfortable rooms in a beautiful secluded garden with a small pool. Very friendly and helpful staff, and simple but nice breakfast which was always served right at the requested time. Rooms cleaned every day, fresh towels every other day. Walking distance from several restaurants and bars, but far enough to not be disturbed by loud music. All for a very reasonable price.

Only point of improvement imo would be to add a little more storage in the room. Our room had a small cupboard which held most of our clothes, but no hanging storage for example. A few hooks would go a long way!","Very quiet, just off the main road but super close to the restaurants. The grounds are constantly being cared for and the rooms are large with comfy beds. Great price and friendly staff. We rented a scooter from the front desk for 75k a day and explored the island. Breakfast order was taken the night before and promptly delivered at your requested time the next morning. Great way to start the day. Very comfortable and chill atmosphere if you're looking for a place to relax after a day of exploring.","Highly recommend. Had a wonderful 3 night stay here. The rooms are clean & comfy, the pool is great and the breakfast is solid. The host family is so friendly and helped me book a snorkel tour and boat back to Bali. We also rented a motorbike for a competitive price and had a blast taking it around the island (recommend having scooter experience first tho). The wifi could be spotty at times. Wonderful stay at this price point. I would come back in a heartbeat"

A unique stay experience with old style huts with modern amenities. Loved the interior setup n private Jacuzzi. The staff were lovely & breakfast was delicious. 3 star hotel with 5 star experience. Be extra cautious driving to the resort as the roads are steep. One downside of this place is that if you need anything then you need to drive down the hill to pick it up from the restaurant or the supermarket. But over all a amazing experience.,"Our group of 4 stayed here for 3 nights. We got a traditional rock house far at the back where we enjoyed 2 beautiful clean bedrooms and spacious shower. Amazing breakfast is served to the room. The house is surrounded by trees and grass, really making for a getaway feeling.
The staffs are extremely helpful. They adjusted breakfast time for our needs, drove us to our diving center and offered to pick us up from anywhere on Penida island when we want to return. They also picked us up after our last dive and drove us to the port.
T
The only minor problem is that it is located on a mildly steep hill and you are constantly annoyed by dogs barking at you the whole way up. If you are scare of dog, don't go there on foot.","We had such an amazing stay at Umah Ilu, where we spent 4 nights. This place is like heaven, surrounded by vegetation, with a view on Mount Agung and the sea. The rooms are comfortable, perfectly clean and quiet. The staff is extremely kind and helpful (special thank you to Wayan !!), they will make every effort to meet your needs (transport, massage, laundry). Really nice restaurants all around. Breakfast was fresh and tasty. We will miss this place for sure !","Amazing place nestled in the beautiful & dense hills of nusa penida, this is a must visit for those who long for a quiet and relaxed holiday far from the rush and bustling city life, just 10 min drive from nusa penida harbour, not the regular hotel which one looks to find but this is one which will take you on a relaxed vacation surrounded by the lush green hills with the sea view.","we felt very comfortable. the cottage was huge and beautifully furnished. we absolutely did not expect that for the low price. the staff was very nice. everything was very clean. the area is very quiet. the cottages are located on a huge area, so you really have a lot of privacy and peace. we can fully recommend the accommodation.
however, you have to keep in mind that you can't get away very well on your own, since the accommodation is practically on a mountain. however, the hotel offers a free service, where you are taken to a restaurant in the evening or can be taken somewhere during the day. we found that really great. however, we also just went on foot twice. theoretically, this is also possible if you are motivated.
breakfast was okay. there could have been more variety."

Overall, highly recommend!","Amazing, one of the best airbnb we have ever stayed in.
Staff were brilliant. Such a peaceful atmosphere.","I very much our stay at Udara Hideaway Villa! The best AirBnb I have ever been to. The villas are a little piece of art - they are tiny but the work with huge windows an lights as well ss its decorations make them look three times bigger. Everything was 100 % clean every day, the breakfasts were delicious (I very much recommend their fried noodle), and everybody on the property was very kind and friendly. The pool and the garden are possibly even more besutiful. Location is perfect.","A nice room with reasonable price! Very clean and comfy. A big bathroom is very nice too.
We didn’t use the pool but seems maintained and clean.
Breakfast is basic but taste good.
Ppl very friendly and helpful, will recommend some cool place to visit!","All 5 starts for sure. Staff is amazing, pool really nice and rooms are clean. Outside shower is nice as well."

Highly recommended","suitable for real Spartans: the shower is extremely contrasty and you cannot influence it, the rim of the toilet bowl can’t easily reach the pool, everything that is broken or rotten in the room cannot be repaired, the kettle cable does not reach the sockets. Beautiful and comfortable pool, but this pool is the neighbor's","Great property ! Amazing location. Well maintained.
They arranged the car and boat transfers ;to and from Bali really well.
Breakfast was good !
Will stay here again when I come back !","Has everything you need from a jug, a fridge and a swimming pool! You can even rent a quality scooter here.
Great location and friendly staff. Will be coming back, highly recommend.","Really a great place to stay in Penida, so near from the beach, restaurants and dive centers. Bike renting, perfect breakfast served in your room included…..and you feel like you are in the middle of the jungle….and of course , the price is super competitive."

We thoroughly enjoyed the stay and the home cooked breakfasts, really appreciated the 3 days there. The bathroom is just cutest ever, and we stayed during full moon, so we were having a shower with the moon shining. Recommend to get a bike. The garden is beautiful, but the best part is probably Luna the doggie!","Be aware, absolute chill vibes ahead.

In the middle of the jungle, you find this super sweet host who is the best in giving the sweet spots of the island away.

We had 4 days of absolutely no tourist stuff, and seen the best places of the island. Only this information is worth your stay at kelibun.

Two sweet cats and a lovely dog. Our stay here was chill. Would recommend.

Be aware, jungle tree house means no airco, but still worth every night staying here.","Great place to stay in the middle of the woods. About 15min walk to the beach where there are a couple of nice bars with live music. The water is also really clear. The rooms don't have ac, but that wasn't a problem. We found our stay quite pleasant.","Very cute and peaceful place.
If you love nature, this place is for you :)
The owner is a very kind man.
The room and bathroom are very clean. 10-15 mins by walk from the main bar area, however would still advise to rent a scooter as it is uphill. You can rent it from the owner for a good price","I had a amazing stay at kelibun. It’s very quiet with a super green and lush garden…you feel like in the jungle. Restaurants are close by… just a 3 min ride down the hill.
The owner Nengah is very helpful and gives a lot of informations about penida and spots to see. I even went on a snorkeling trip with his boat and saw beautiful reef and mantas.

The bungalows are beautiful, the bed is comfy and I loved the outdoor bathroom where you can take shower and see the jungle around. Breakfast was delicious.
All in all a perfect stay and I would come back any time!"

We planned to stay with family for 2 days but decided to extend for additional nights. The host Putu and his family are one of the most open-heart people we ever met, they helped us in organising our trip. And their place is absolutely comfortable for families","Very cute and clean Bungalows, amazing view from the balcony. Staff is wonderful, even made me breakfast at 6am because I had to leave early for the ferry.","This place was great! Our host Putu was really nice and helped out with everything. He provided us sarongs for our temple visits, gave us antiseptics to clean our wounds after a scooter crash, and made us feel like family.
The breakfast (with ocean view) was super tasty.
Everything was perfect and we would love to stay again!","Highly recommended place to stay during your Nusa Penida trip, great and friendly staff. Beautiful view, good breakfast with fresh juice and kopi/tea. They also provide a pick up service from the port and scooter rental service. The location is in my opinion really good, not far from the beach, beach clubs and food stalls."

The bungalows are basic, without much more than a bed and hot shower. They include aircon and decent sized breakfast served on your own veranda. Good price/performance ratio for this area.

He garden is lovingly arranged and the pool is very nice. Far away enough from the street to be a quiet little Oasis.

The owner and staff is very helpful and help you with a scooter or transport on a whim. If you don't mind a living a little basic this is a good place to go. Only downside is that the bungalows start to feel a little ""aged"", even though they are only a few years old.","Very friendly staff! Location close to our diving resort, we were able to rent a scooter and good working room facilities.","Room is basic, i was travelling solo and had no prior reservation. Negotiated the price myself and got a pretty good deal (much better than the online rates). The guest house is run by a family and they are very polite their English language is not good and need to use the translator every time to explain. I had a situation where in the scooter i rented from the port got exchanged by mistake from my end. The owner of the scooter came to hotel and demanded huge amount of money to get the scooter from Klingking beach or asked me to go and get the scooter myself. The family intervened in my favour and the hotel guy came along with me till Klingking beach on his motorbike and we bought back the scooter. It was a very kind gesture and they did not charge me anything for it.
The owner lady Lim is really sweet, when they learnt that I am from India and I am a Hindu, they were so delighted to know about the culture of India. It was great time staying here. Hope to visit again.","Super service!!!
The bungalow was simple, but clean. Very good prize for what you get. The owner is super friendly and helps you with whatever you like to do. Also gives you tips and arranges a scooter, snorkeling trips and whatever you like. Best budget option!","Wow, beautiful here. Very friendly staff, well maintained garden, decent swimming pool (especially beautiful at night), several options for breakfast. Really good mattress as well.
Stayed at the full moon bungalows first, but switched to Timbool, what a difference."

The setting is very friendly and quiet. This place is very good value for money. The host is very sympathetic and concerned about the good stay of the travelers. They have a swimming pool (essential in very hot weather) and you can rent a scooter (essential to be autonomous on this island). There are a shared kitchen too, very convenient.

Super clean mattress, room and bathroom. Nice view! Super kind and polite staff! We have enjoyed our stay here. There is also shade for parking the motorbike. Strongly recommend!","We arrived in Nusa Penida without accommodation because we had made a mistake renting accommodation in Nusa Lembongan. In our search we found Vina Bungalows, with very modern rooms at a great price. We decided to take a chance and booked for two nights with breakfast included. It was the best surprise. The place is a 10-minute motorcycle ride from the port of Nusa Penida, in a super quiet area in the middle of nature. We woke up to the birds and had a fantastic view of nature and the sea. It's a 5-minute bike ride from many warungs, restaurants, bars, discos and beaches. The breakfast was super delicious and there was plenty to choose from. The bed is super comfortable, there's hot water and free toiletries, the air conditioning works perfectly and the decor is modern. The room is super clean and the towels are replaced, the bed was also made during our stay. The room is spotless. The hosts are very friendly and humble. On the last day we had to check out at midday and we didn't have the boat to Sanur until 4.30pm. The hosts were quick to take care of our luggage until we left, and we still had time to go for a walk and do some beach time before we left. We would definitely recommend this place. You won't regret it. We wish you every success and happiness.","Everything about this place is beautiful, the people who work on it are really nice and helpful, it’s spotless clean, comfortable and super peaceful. Location is also good, it’s up the ‘jungle’ overlooking on top of the tree line but super close to all the beach bars.","Nice place to stay, nice view over the jungle on the sea at the end, the staff is friendly, a bit out of the busy area, which is great

Also they are renovating and building new houses right now, so hopefully it's going to be better in the future.","We stayed here for 2 nights for my diving course at Freedivenusa. Strategically located within minutes walk away to Freedivenusa and some other diving centers, also minutes to the beach. Walk some more and we can reach SD point snorkeling/diving spot.

The room is comfortable, hospitality is great for the price, staffs are super friendly and accomodating. They also have swimming pool in the bungalow area. Sufficient breakfast provided (just simple noodle/fried rice/omelette options and juices for us to choose).

Close to some great beach cafes too. Would love to come back again one day when I continue my freediving courses!","I stayed here in 2018 and forgot about the name of this place, until today when I found some old pictures from my trip. The staff was soooo sweet and accommodating. They brought a fruit platter to my room upon arrival. There was a younger girl who spoke good English and gave advice on nearby activities. The location is not close to the beach but get a scooter and you will be 10 minutes away, especially since you are in the mountains the scenery is beautiful. The rooms were clean with comfortable beds. 10/10 would come back again!!","Really great location and friendly staff. It's close enough to walk to bars and restaurants, but far enough from road that it's quiet. The bungalows are nice with AC and hot water. You really feel like you're out there with cows and chickens wandering around. They'll deliver food from local restaurant too if you're feeling lazy.

They were very helpful too on anything we asked where it was they would just have us follow them on our scooter and take us right where we need to go.","It should be 6 of 5. We were staying for 4 days for family gathering.

The place is quiet, but not too far from the main area. Beach is walking distance. There are plenty restaurants nearby. In the night time, the street is very dark. However, your phone flashlight will help you. The cottage is very clean and the staffs clean properly everyday. Please do not expect Sheraton level, but the bed and pillows are very comfortable. Love the space because there are plenty plants - much cooler than the beach area. You can play with chickens and cows next to the cottage if you would like.

The service: unexpected excellent - two thumbs up. Every staffs are ""too"" friendly. They love chat and sharing their information and anything you asked. We feel like their friends. Mr. Karyawan is even better. If you stay there, please ask them to arrange everything (as we did). Including snorkeling, diving, tour, rent a car, and boat. They do the services much more than we expected it (quality).

Two weeks after the trips, my families are still remember their staffs names. Yeah, I can still remember how good they are (and we will never forget) this trips. Highly recommend to anyone!"
