Water is refreshed only a couple of times in the day for a limited duration. Highly recommend planning other activities on your own since the person in-charge tends to give bike / kecak ticket options that are expensive. Apart from that, the house is really well built. Value for money (can cost around IDR 1,500,000 or above for 2 nights for 2 guests). Rooms are big & comfortable. There is parking space within the property. Road outside the house can get really dark at night due to lack of street lamps so be mindful of that. Location of the house is helpful since it's around the centre and major locations are nearby.

1. It came with boiled egg instead of pindang egg .
2. It‚Äôs tasteless and dry. Wondering if the cook forgot to mix in the sauces into the noodle (any garlic oil,salt, soy sauce if used)
3. It doesn‚Äôt come with any plain soup as it is normally serve together with any bakmi here in Indonesia üò≠

I hope I‚Äôm just unlucky this time and they forgot to put in the things I mention above.
So much could be improved to make it better.
