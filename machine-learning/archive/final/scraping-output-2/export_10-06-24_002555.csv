The couple running this place were helpful and friendly. The price is very reasonable, and the swing very secure and felt very safe. Excellent view over the valley. There is no sign from the street, just go to the spot on Google maps.","The swing was huge and the view to the rice terraces is just stunning!! A married couple operating it were literally the nicest people I have ever met. Also, I had like 5 minutes on the swing!
If you're traveling from Ubud to Sidemen (or Amed) please do not miss this place, try the swing, have a beer or soft drink and support this kind, local family!
The price for the swing was not as high as in Ubud either..they basically said pay whatever I feel right. So I gave around a 100k with a beer included.","The swing is operated by a really sweet married couple, theyâ€™ll make sure everything is alright, they even push you on the swing. We had a lot of time on the swing as well, I totally recommend",Really nice people!,
