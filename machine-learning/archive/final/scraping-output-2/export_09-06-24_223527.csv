The route here is challenging but amazing. The few from the campground is very good and the sunset is also very beautiful. There is a bathroom you can use here.
Staff is friendly!","Went there not on weekend and we had the place for ourself which definitely a big plus üòä very helpful and friendly staffs and we had a really nice conversation with pak gede (the owner). The place has an amazing view from the top of the hill, but not too easy to find. Our suggestion is just contact pak gede for further direction. Prepared your own food & beverages because here you will experience a real camping (don‚Äôt expect a glamcamp!) which we love! ‚ù§Ô∏è","Great Spot For Camping, The Facility is Okay,  but the toilet is a bit far and also there only two of them. It can be annoy specially in the weekend where this place is fully booked you should take a line for using the toilet

The Sunrise View is amazing and also here is not as cold as kintamani and bedugul",Good spot for Nature Lover.. secluded with moonrise-starry night-bird and crickets-trully nature good for campers and they also have rooms with bed,"An Absolute stunning place to go for camping! Gorgeous view, calm and quiet atmosphere, and close to some waterfalls, I Had the best experience for Camping with my friends there!! Gede Suartha (the Owner) super chill!!"

The weather was rainy when we visited, but still had a lot of fun - the scenery is amazing, highly recommend it!","The view is beautiful when there is no fog. This place is just starting to be developed, there are stalls, swings, photo spots.  If only there were fried bananas to accompany Balinese coffee, I would certainly feel at home sitting for a long time while enjoying the cool and fresh air.  The owner, Kadek Edi, and his wife are also very friendly to chat with while I'm there.","Absolutely stunning! A must see on your trip to Bali! The road there is breathtaking and views when you arrive does not disappoint. Kadek, the owner, is a phenomenal host with the kindest soul. He will be sure to make your trip one to remember. 10/10 recommend",,
