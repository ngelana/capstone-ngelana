ChIJj2OG3RsR0i0RqCF47JL2Xf4,Warung Nasi Babi Guling Pan Edy,-8.483113,115.37880129999998,"Jl. Raya Timuhun, Timuhun, Kec. Banjarangkan, Kabupaten Klungkung, Bali 80752, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=18329077169360740776,OPERATIONAL,+62 819-1806-9082,indonesian_restaurant,"indonesian_restaurant, restaurant, food",4.6,147,,"A place with a view (rice fields and Mt Agung) and really delicious food. Today's skin is crisp and crunchy and this elevates the Babi guling entirely. Soup is not salty and appetizing. Portion is good and generous. Really worth it if you are nearby. Came on a Thursday 12pm, I was able to get a seat immediately.
Price: Rp30k","Delicious authentic Babi Guling at local prices with a stunning view. This Warung was recommended by Dira from Aan Secret Waterfall (also highly recommended for an incredible walk and nature experience). The restaurant is spacious, clean and well set up, the staff are very friendly with excellent English. There is a beautiful view over local farmland / rice fields with Mt Agung spectacular in the distance. It's about a 45min drive from Ubud. We ordered their standard Babi Guling meal that comes with a spicy soup, rice and plate of Babi Guling and Balinese vegetable dishes, served like Nasi Campur with small portions of the various dishes on the one plate (rice and soup served separately). We had iced tea and a refreshing Bibtang each. For the 2 of us the total cost was RP 60K (25K per meal plus drinks). Such great value for an excellent meal. Only catch is its quite spicy so if you love your chilli üå∂ you'll love this. I don't tolerate super spicy food and this was on my threshold but totally worth it! Would come again in a heartbeat.","Good Balinese babi guling joint in Gianyar. They are very famous so you most likely will be on a waiting list for walk ins.

The restaurant is open space so you can enjoy good sunny weather, staffs are helpful and parking lot is decent.",Just stopped after hitting up Aan waterfall & the locals were rad & friendly. They have some snacks & cold ones üçª,Heard we are the first tourism to patronise them. Patronised by locals and we like the food so much.
