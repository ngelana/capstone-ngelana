I did the booking for my guests, it was 14 pax in total. I was booked the whole area. The mansion also the villas.

Hats up for the staff team, started from the manager, reception, the housekeeper, chef, all of them were so helpful and fast response.

Even though I asked for a last minute request to move the bed to another room, they were happy to help. Their services are above and beyond.

Overall, my guests were happy and enjoying to stay in their villa. The price they give is also reasonable and great value.

The important thing to know is, if you are staying here, you need to know that the area is a bit cold in the morning and night time. So make sure you bring an extra jacket with you.

If you like a sauna, then you are at the right place, beside the pool they also provide you a sauna place to warm your body. And for the private villas they have a private jacuzzi, and a large space for chilling and enjoying the view.

Thank you to Ragil for helping me a lot for the booking etc.
Juni and Kadek as the reception was so helpful and gave a fast response to my guests and I.
Dewi and Ricko the chef that I always meet in the morning, and serving amazing breakfast meals for my guests.
For the housekeepers, Made, Aan & Kadek, that I couldn't mention one by one. I really appreciate their hard work to make the room clean and tidy.
Special thanks to Kadek for bringing me the towel, even though it were outside his desk job.
All of them were amazing üôèüëçü•∞

I would definitely recommend this villa to my guests in the future. Thank you for the great hospitality.",If your visiting Munduk we definitely recommend this place location is just perfect. You're close to everything that you can see in the area.  We stayed in a two bedroom villa with Jacuzzi and enjoyed everything had a stunning view. We also enjoyed the food of the restaurant definitely a recommender.,"From the moment I arrived, I was utterly captivated by the magnificence of Shankara Munduk Bali. I went here with my friend from Japan and they really like it. The villa itself is clean, very affordable price for this luxury accommodation and it‚Äôs near from banyumala waterfall and lake tamblingan as well.

The breakfast itself, I really love the Munduk Pancake, it‚Äôs unique and not too sweet. After went to waterfall, I ate lunch in the villa. The Indonesian food was amazing, love the plating. Their chicken satay & banana fritter are must order!

A special shoutout to the afternoon tea while enjoying sunset. They served us assorted Balinese traditional cake & hot tea, it was executed to perfection. We also went for sauna because the air here was a little bit cold. After that, we went for dinner in here too (really love their soto medan and tempe mendoan).

Talk about the service. The staff was friendly, attentive and warmth, they explained and served us very well, really appreciate about that. I highly recommended Shankara Resort Munduk to anyone who wants to have staycation in Munduk. For this price range, it‚Äôs a very great deal !","Had a great stay here in Munduk. The hostess of the hotel, Kendran, was so sweet and attentive. They ensured we had everything we needed during our stay, and made our time in Munduk beyond amazing. We will be back! Thank you Kendran and staff!",Recomended for 'healing' with good condition
