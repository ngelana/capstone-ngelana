The place would be great for those seeking quiet nights. Overall, the place is truly great!","A friend booked this place for me during my brief stay in Singaraja and I was impressed by the cleanliness, beauty and amenities provided.
The staff was very friendly and helpful, my room and bathroom was clean and smelled nice. And the pool / common area was beautifully arranged, also clean.
I would absolutely stay here again.","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Odika Lovina, Villa, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. Nestled in the heart of Lovina, this villa offers a perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and tranquility.

The accommodations were immaculate and beautifully designed, providing a true sense of Balinese charm. The rooms were spacious, with comfortable beds, modern amenities, and stunning views of the surrounding tropical gardens. I particularly loved the private pool area, which was the perfect spot to relax and unwind.

The staff at Odika Lovina, Villa were outstanding. They were incredibly attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of our stay was perfect. From arranging excursions to providing personalized recommendations for local dining and activities, their hospitality was top-notch.

One of the highlights of our stay was the villa's proximity to Lovina Beach. It was just a short walk away, allowing us to easily enjoy the beautiful sunsets and the famous dolphin-watching tours. The serene location also made it an ideal base for exploring the natural beauty and cultural attractions of the region.

Overall, Odika Lovina, Villa provided an unforgettable experience. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a peaceful retreat, this villa is a perfect choice. I can't recommend it highly enough and look forward to returning in the future.","We loved our stay here, so frendly so cosy modern and always ready to help.
We really loved the place and hope to come back .
Thanks a lot for organising our Snorkelling et waterfalls…","The staff were extremely friendly. It's only a 5-minute drive to Dolphin Beach. The road to the hotel was quite dark, and we initially thought we had taken a wrong turn since we arrived at night, but there were staff members there to greet us. The rooms were quite comfortable, and the pricing was reasonable."

The buffet style breakfast was okay. The place was crawling with black and yellow millipedes though. Probably a breeding season or something. There were also some cats around that kept bugging us for food. Other than that I have little to complain about.,"Well, I loved the spacious room and bathroom. It is the type of hotel that pay attention on the surrounding park, the garden around the room is well tended. There is shortcut from the hotel backyard to nearest beach, on the way there we're going to walk on a pathway that has the view of rice field. It is beautiful! Another note, this is the first time I stayed in a hotel with a pool that has 2m-depth!","Be carefull with the staff.
I already asked to cancel my reservation and they approved it, but they still charge my card for ""no-show"" exactly the same price per night. Like, it's fine with the charge but full room price? What a nonsense.","Stayed about 12 hrs here. It is a beautiful place, quite strategic and have access to beach. Its very Indonesia style and thats what interesting. Hope the management could pay more attention to staff training. Being friendly and accomodative can't cover everything.
For a four stars, their linen and towel was good enough (white clean & smell fresh), room was clean and well maintained. Bed is a bit too soft and i had no where to put shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and facial foam. There was only a small place to put a small soap. I am not using a soap from head to toe.
Bfast was not a total disaster, but it was not all good either. Ordered brown toast but were given a white toast. Bread & pastry were no longer fresh, nice butter though. At least they did not serve an ice hard butter. A ""no"" to jam, personally dislike both jam selection.
P.S. Remember to ask housekeeping to spray insect repellent. Mosquitos & big ants.
P.P.S. Be prepare for what you order is not what you get. Remember you were there for holiday. You dun want to ruin your day just because of a bfast. Maybe you can fill in the breakfast menu selection with a stabilo or red marker instead of just ticking the box."

It is a two star hotel, expect nothing more than that.

When we arrived it started well, reception was friendly and welcoming. We saw there spa packages, and decided to book one and then headed to the room. When we got to the room things took a turn, immediately when entering there were feet stains on the walls about shoulder height, clearly visible to anyone. The bed wasn’t made too well, with the duvet skew I the sheet. The bedside tables were falling off of the wall, so slanted that anything would fall off or pull the entire unit out of the wall. The balcony is not private and separated from the other units, you could easily walk between each of them. The shower points out horizontally, not down on top of you, making showering an interesting experience. When we went to the front desk later, they explained the spa treatment was actually in the room, not in a prepared spa. They were extremely pushy when we tried to cancel this, as we didn’t want to be held liable for any mess in the room. We didn’t end up sleeping either of our two nights there due to feeling unclean and uncomfortable with our treatment. When we went to return the key and show the staff the problems, they changed their story from saying they were ‘fully booked’ to saying they had better rooms available. Clearly an attempt to get you to upgrade. They were combative and full of excuses and made checking out even more taxing. Again, be wary of other positive or fake reviews, not everyone online is reflective of reality.","For Bali standard this is not a 2 star hotel, I would say closer to 3.5-4, it is very clean, well maintained and is exactly what you need for a cheap overnight stay. I would have to say this is one of the better places I’ve stayed for cheap accommodation. Very clean and comfortable with working A/C","Had an amazing stay at this hotel. The staff are very friendly and very helpful, once even giving me a lift to the best ATM in the town, completely for free. We got a room with a balcony, and it was the nicest room we’ve had in SE Asia, comfy bed and great AC. Definitely recommend.","All in all its a good place to stay, 1st floor have private garden.
Nice breakfast.
Big pool with child pool.
Available for car parking","That was one of the best hotels in Bali we’ve been to. Opened since 2 months so everything is clean and fresh.
Super kindly personnel (but also not too much pressure of buying tickets, massage etc.). The room with balcony is big, spacious and has very nice view.
The swimming pool is great - clean and refreshing. Big enough to swim everyday for some exercises.
The only minus were some russians who don’t understand that 10pm is enough for being loud and were partying in the swimming pool till 1-2 am. The personnel couldn’t even make them stop.
Anyway - if you’re looking for great hotel for good price in Lovina - highly recommend you this place! 😊"

A great family running this place, the garden area and common areas are so pretty and beautiful and the hosts are so nice and helpful, if you just ask them anything!
Had some great days here, thank you and hope to see you again, one day!","We've been here several times and can highly recommend this place! Kadek and his family are among the most helpful and warm-hearted people we've met in Bali. You can book all activities here at reasonably low prices.

Now, addressing some negative reviews:

1)When booking an affordable homestay, one should not expect 5-star services for breakfast and in the room. It's fair to appreciate the reasonable price.

2)In Asia, one should not complain about cockroaches – it comes with the territory. If you want to avoid that, maybe book a high-end hotel in Norway.

3) If you book a dolphin tour at his place ( wich is only 200.000 including small cake,coffee,water,snorkeling and swimming with the dolphin) kadek will commit to his boat driver and cancel other guests due to your booking.
So if you cancel it, the boat driver has no income at that day and for people depending on every penny, a spontaneous cancellation can have signifikant consequences.

4)If you book a room without air conditioning and cold water, don't complain about it. It's crucial to have realistic expectations and accept the options you've chosen.","Stay here was excelent. Comfortable and clean rooms with everything what you need while travelling around. Kedak made this experience even better with his open mind and heart, as he shared with us his perspective on live, arak and great contact’s for everything what we needed. Great banana pancakes for breakfast 🥞","This place is absolutely AMAZING 👏 The family is so warm and open, there is breakfast and diner included and they even get you fresh fruit out of the trees! The family itself feels like friends that you know for a decade. The rooms are fine, I would like a little more darkness but overall had a good night sleep!

We had been in Bali for a few days, but it was only here that we saw Bali for real. The food turned our heads, the owners took a lot of time telling us about family, business about Bali. They showed us their handicrafts, some of which can also be purchased at Bali 9.

It is a peaceful place to relax. This time we stayed for 15 days, you can book all sorts of day trips with a driver, you can also book spa treatments that take place in the garden…we will definitely come again!","We made a 4 day stop @ Saraswati on our way through bali. Its a very unique resort as there are only 2 bungalows for rent which are both surrounded by a wonderful garden. As it is all very natural you might see ants, birds, bees, geckos and so on but i think its absolutely intended to experience bali in its traditional ways and not sterile and artificial like in some of the 4-5 star resorts.  Theres a large, clean pool which was perfect for our kids. If the other bungalow is free you basically have the whole area for yourself. The owners, a german woman and her husband, are living on the compound as well. She was very kind, helpful and always had an open ear to our needs. She planned our tours and we were very pleased with the experience. Also she helped with the laundry and getting a really good massage - all services cam at very low rates ! The bungalows have a large terrace where we had our breakfast and hang out from time to time. They are not luxurious but absolutely ok.  It was very peaceful and quiet. Theres a kitchen and a large fridge where they place everything u need for breakfast so that you can take whatever, whenever you like. The prices for beverages (beer, coke etc.) where lower than in some of the supermarkets. Free water was provided in a 20 liter tank. Every morning we got a nice fruit plattern and, if we wished, a traditional balinese breakfast made by the owner herself.
Lovina is, unlike sanur or nusa dua, not that touristic. The beaches could be cleaner and the sideways better maintained but the Saraswati made up for it. Even 2 weeks later our now 4 years old son is still asking to get back there ;)..","If you're looking for a place to rest and simply getaway from city and busy life, this is the place to go. Secluded into small alley on a riverside with green surroundings. Bamboo forests in front of the house makes the area breezy. There's no tv, but they have collection of books and board games. The bungalow is spacious and clean. Breakfast is self service but with complete options of bread, butter, jams, eggs, and balinese snack. Shld try the german bread, it's delicious! All and all, lovely place to stay, even my boys enjoy it very much.",Good place to relieve fatigue,

Was dropped off here by shuttle bus when we arrived in Lovina Beach.  Very aggressive staff.  Very pushy trying to get you to extend your stay and purchase their overpriced tours.

Tried to charge us $1.50/kg for laundry when they were bringing it next door and having it done for $0.40/kg.

Staff has no use for you once they realize you are not purchasing anything from them.

Very noisy day and night as staff like to hang out in common area right outside rooms.  One person does all the work while the rest of them (who speak English) laze around and wait to torment you at every opportunity.

Rooms were not well kept.  Breakfast was horrendous so was the coffee.

Perks: television (very few English channels) and comfy bed.","Avoid this place like the plague. We were told we could look around and if we didn't like it they would take us to the center of the city. After we expressed disinterest, they completely abandoned us and forced us to walk. Avoid this business and the people who work there. Additionally, the rooms have bed bugs, extensive mold, and are ugly. This hotel serves as a meeting ground for corrupt individuals who have no problem scamming their customers. Avoid!","We were taken here not direct to our villa from Ubud where we asked to come out of the car and was subjected to a 40 minute sale push. The man told us he was the manager of Hotel Celuk Buluh and the tour company associated with it. He told us that he could offer us a snorkelling trip with guaranteed turtles and manataray as well as a sunken temple. He first wanted £110 GBP per person after we denied this he went down to £50 per person showing us the pictures of the sea life and temple again, we agreed on this basis.
The next day we were picked up went snorkelling never to see turtles, manataray or the sunken temple. We asked the guides who told us that was a completely different island to where we went. We tried to call ""Abes"" who we booked with and he's number did not work. We went back to the hotel where he was nowhere to be seen and the other young staff who ""could not speak English"" could not tell us where he was, where to find him and if he would be back tomorrow.
We looked up reviews to find that this man is a professional scam artist. How did he know we were coming and who took us there and clearly knew ""Abes""?
Please Everyone avoid and share the message that Hotel Celuk Buluh is a complete scam for innocent tourist caught off guard. I will not stop writing reviews on every site I can to help prevent future victims of ""Abes"". I have read that he goes by different names, on being Doki, he has a pony tail and shaved sides. DON'T BE FOOLED!!!","Cold showers despite advertising hot, electricity went two nights in a row, but worst of all, associates with a coward con-man who sold us a package deal littered with lies in order to scam us of our money. When confronted at the hotel, he fled out the back courtyard. Do yourself a favour and avoid like the plague.","AVOID this place. Its a SCAM and they will rip you off.

Booked the place in Airbnb. The place is listed as ""Lovina Green Villa 'Garden View'. Gede - the host never showed up and did not answer any of my calls. Strangely, he replied my text though. He suggested a shuttle bus from Ubud that took us straight to his place. As soon as I reached there, the staffs surrounded us to pay for their snorkeling, diving and returning shuttle bus service. When I denied,  I was threatened.

The host said that ""Ketut""-the manager will fix the lights when the lights went off. Ketut told me that he is not the manager. ""I just stop by"".

We reached there at night so we did not have any choice but to stay there.  The ""Villa"" looks and smells like sh**t.
-There were no bed sheets
-Toilet was not clean
-There were no towels and toilet papers in the toilet.
-Kitchen has no stove or any utensils"

Its location is both secluded and near all the local activities, accessible on foot. There is a beach nearby, the pool is awesome and quite big, the biggest in Bali I saw. The territory is very well maintained and lush green. The rooms are great, spacious and clean. You could ask to tidy the room as often as you need. There is breakfast avalible, and it is very tasty and big as well as very cheap. The owner is however the best part of this place. Annie is incredibly nice and kind, the most accommodating host you'll ever find. She will make you feel at home, help with every problem, show you all the best places around and set you up with any activity you wish.
It is a great option even excluding the price, but if you take it into account, then there is literally no better option. Come here and you won't regret it! I didn't.","You get good home care. Breakfast is rich and very tasty. The place is clean and the atmosphere is relaxed. I travel a lot, but I haven't experienced anything this special. This accommodation is extraordinary. Annie and Russel create a sense of family peace and comfort.","The best host during the our whole 7-months long Asian trip.

To feel even more like at home, Annie, who is just an amazing and full of love woman (which we already call our Mama) baked these gorgeous cookies with home made pineapple 🍍 jam.

We are so thankful to meet such an awesome person in our trip which does everything to make us feel like being at home.
Thank you 🙏.

So if you gonna visit Lovina, Bali, DON’T miss the chance to stay here for at least one night to feel how beautiful and open hearted can the human be. 💚

Annie we love you 😘",I'm stuck in Bali because of Covid-19 and i feel that i'm lucky to have found this place. Annie is an amazing host and she cares a lot about her guests. She is always in touch asking if we need anything. The place is always clean and tidy. It's a joy to relax in the clear waters of the swimming pool. It has almost been 2 months here and i'm not missing home that much thanks to the family atmosphere.,"Laviana Bungalow is a lovely place to stay. Immaculate clean, great wifi and lots of international channels on TV.
The cherry on the cake is the very nice pool.
And Annie is a formidable host and a great cook."
