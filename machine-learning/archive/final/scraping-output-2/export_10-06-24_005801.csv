Love the play area for kids and the friendly staff!,"the atmosphere is good, motorbike parking is a bit difficult, the view is good, the prices are very friendly for foreign visitors, the food is quite ordinary for that price","Dukuh Paradise is a great restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere and quality service. We ordered some avocado raps and a rib eye, both dishes left us very satisfied. We also took advantage of the swings (extra charge of 350k) which, in our opinion, are the ones with the best views we've seen. The price is slightly high but it's worth it for the service, atmosphere and quality of the food."

So when we had to go to the toilet in the middle of the night, we had to go down the steep flight of stairs and get bitten by mosquitoes in the process.

Came here for a late lunch with a mate whose Vegetarian, and I (a Non-Vegetarian) was the one who ended up buying an additional Nasi Campur for dinner.

Definitely a recommended spot, especially with the lovely old couple who run the place. Some parking for scooters, streetside for cars.","Yes, reviews are true. I just finished my plate. It's like food as good and tasty served at a vipassana retreat. I'm not a vegetarian anymore for quite some time now, but this was fantastic. The husband makes the kombucha by himself so don't forget to take it with your meal. 22k for nasi campur where you get a little bit of everything. 7k for a bottle of the rosella kombucha. Really good btw, better than those commercialised brands you have here on Bali. So 29k for belly full of good tasting food üôè","Enjoyed a delicious vegetarian nasi campur, satay, and crispy tempe here! This was exactly the kind of veggie Balinese home cooking that I was looking for. The owners were very kind and hospitable, too. Highly recommend!","Found this veggie place on our way back to South.
The staff don't talk too much English but communication worked anyway. Food was good, tasty and freshly cooked with normal portion: $5.5 for 2 adults! (seen on pictures)
Cons: They didn't give us the proper menu, so the bill was slightly different!
Place worth a stop!","Amazing local vegetarian warung! Fresh tasty food, amazing homemade Kombucha and probably the best and spiciest sambal. Ode to these lovely owners who do this for 23 yearsüôè"
