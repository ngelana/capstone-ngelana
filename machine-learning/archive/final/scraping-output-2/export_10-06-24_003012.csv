This place had a lot of 5-star reviews, so we hopped a Grab and headed there for lunch. Google needs to update their hours as they close at 4pm, NOT 1pm. The food was AMAZINGLY good. We even took an order to go. Careful of the spice level if you don‚Äôt eat spicy food. Highly recommended üëç",So delicious and spicy local food. You must enjoy it if you can bear the chilli,"This place is true hidden gem! The first time i tried babi guling was not a good experience, but this place proved me wrong :) The meat and skin is delicious ü§§ really a place worth to try üëç",Till now the crispiest pork skin and juiciest meat i have had in Bali jaaan,Good food
