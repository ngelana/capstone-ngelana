Nice fountain and food was ok and buffets style but  you pay extra for the soft drinks","Amazing trip
It was perfect place for rafting for the people who love adventures
The adventure starting with zip line which make it more excited
It was 3 hours of rafting with a beautifully amazing natural views
I suggest to take a camera that attached to your body so you can enjoy the rafting and take photos of the amazing views around you also take a backup battery with you
The staff were good in advising and kind they will handle all
Services good they will take you from and to your hotel",Food was just ok but the staff accompanying you for rafting are amazing hardworking people. It's a must do activity. One of the longest. Around 3 hours in water.,Finish point of bmw rafting for the telaga River. Lunch was part of the trip and was OK but not great. Difficult to get a gojek. No towels available after the trip even though stated that it would be provided.,Shower towels supplied . For being out in the country side don't expect high quality but being wet a hot shower and a clean towel is great. Food was great even supplied water melon after. More then happy. Would even do it again. Enjoy

There seems to be insufficient water to get raft down the river. With the guide spending most of his time out of the boat getting you off the bottom. It was three hours of misery in sewerage contaminated river. With a midway stop. Lousy with mossies and beverages 4 x market rate. My but and legs were numb as we bumped away down a river with very little directional control. Most frustrating and tedious 3 hours.",Super nice rafting with BCR. Also probably the longest rafting tour available at Tegala Waja as the other companies stop way earlier! We felt very safe with our funny guide. Thank you very much for this great experience!,Had a amazing time at BCR rafting our guide was nice and it was all very safe. I lost my phone during the pick up at my scooter. Luckily they found it üôÇ I recommend,We had a lovely range of Balinese foods here just after white water rafting. The food was hot and fresh.

The hotel (The Samanvaya) organised a car to the starting point, where we were fitted with safety gear and given a safety briefing. The team leading the trip were extremely friendly and checked that we were all happy with safety information.

Shortly after, we were on the water, ready to take on the 16km course. From the moment you start, it is pretty much non-stop rapids, which ranged from the gentle to the ferocious. The scenery was absolutely spectacular, and it genuinely looked like something from another planet in places.

The course took nearly 3 hours in total to finish, and did include a couple of short breaks so you could catch your breath. There were some snacks and drinks sold at one of the break points if you needed something. The guides who are in the boat can take your valuables in their waterproof bag, so you can take your phones/wallets with you if you needed.

We opted to buy their photo package at the end  of our adventure. It was very reasonably priced for the quality of the photos, which they took of you along the route. They were very quick to send you the high-resolution versions by WhatsApp and email afterwards.

Overall, we had a fantastic time with Green Adventure Rafting. The operation was professional and we felt very safe whilst we were with them. Our guides were very experienced and seemed to know the river like the back of their hand. If you‚Äôre in Sidemen and looking for a thrilling activity that you won‚Äôt forget ‚Äì Green Adventure Rafting is the place to go.","We can‚Äôt thank the team at GAR enough. We found them to be the best value for Monday when researching online which was great, but they blew us away with their great service and good vibes! Very professional setup felt safe the whole way. Can‚Äôt say the same for some other companies. We definitely recommend booking with GAR. The guide pictures was a great guy! Please tell him to add me on instagram ü§£@joeyjackedit. The meal at the end we found nice after a long trip, we also had the best coconuts in all of Bali along the way. Wayan was great to chat to at the end and super helpful. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!","We had such a great time rafting in Bali, the landscape is incredible and the guide was amazing - totally recommend","Green Adventure Rafting have their destination facilities here - hot shower, dry towel, toilets and a really Indonesian nice lunch buffet. Best thing is your driver and your clothes / bag are waiting for you! A very well-organised whitewater rafting experience in Bali","Very nice and clean place, great lunch after our rafting activity."

My sister and I were the only ones in the raft with two guides. We had a great time enjoying the rapids and even a swim at a waterfall. The guides were very knowledgable and we felt safe the entire time. At the end they provide showers, towels and lunch. The price is very reasonable for the length of time and whats included. Absolutely recommend!","Telaga waja river is really long, 17km so expect a lot of rowing. It was incredibly fun with a few stop points and one with a big waterfall with a small pool below that you can swim in! Really nice people around and service","Easily the worst experience in Bali. Online it says 250, 000 per person for Tubing but they wanted 450,000 for person and they would only accept cash. The staff is extremely rude and unhelpful. They wanted to operate as a cash only business and when we wanted to leave they refused to provide any help at all. They have no WiFi and when we asked to help with taxi they just claimed they didn‚Äôt exist. I cannot believe how unprofessional and rude the staff was. They just acted like goons and thugs. Would stay far away from them.",Great experience and very friendly guide. Cash only upon arrival but flexible to allow payment to driver back at hotel after.,"Totally awesome experience, my first time doing rafting."

House have a kettle and outside table so you can enjoy tea.

Thank you Ketut, we will come back one day.
I highly recommend this place:)","For the price, it's totally worth it. I went there with my best friend. The view from the balcony was magnificent. The service from Bli Ketut and Mbok Komang were outstanding, very friendly and hospitable. They have a cute cat and dog as their pets. We ordered food from them and got free fruits and Balinese snacks for breakfast. Free flow coffee and tea. We stayed in a three-rooms house. This place is located in the southern part of Sidemen, which is a hidden gem.","Just spent three nights there and I am for sure coming back. The room is so nice and the view is amazing. The family is so kind and helpful. I went on A day trip with Ketut and we saw so many beautiful places and had so much fun.
I can definitely recommend both staying at Narta guest house and having Ketut as a tour guide‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è","We agree with all the wonderful things everyone has said about Ketut and his familie's homestay! The guesthouse is lovely, perfectly clean and one of the few mould-free places on  a budget . The view is incredible and the sound of the river soothes you to sleep like a lullaby. This beautiful big-hearted family will welcome you with open arms and treat you as their own. This is true Bali living at its most authentic.  We also highly recommend the white water rafting!
We will be back!! Thankyou! üôè","If you want to experience Bali like the locals do. You‚Äôre in the right place and with the right person!
Owners are very friendly. After staying with the owners you are a part of the family. Staying here feels like a second home and the view morning and evening is amazing! A trip to Bali is not compleet without staying here."
