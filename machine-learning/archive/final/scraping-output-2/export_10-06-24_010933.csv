I was beginning to think that the only place to get a good cocktail was Amok, but I was wrong. The place is tiny but cozy and cute. It’s very quiet in there so please don’t fight with your spouse or get wasted. I got the chicken Parm which was awesome. My wife got the pad Thai which was terrible but the waitress happily switched it out for us no charge. Instead my wife got the the chicken wrap which was amazing.",We loved this little Balinese & international restaurant. The service is really good and they always ask if you enjoyed their dishes. The portions are good sized and you can either sit inside or outside. Definitely recommend 💫,"My favorite restaurant in Nusa and maybe the entire Bali!
Food is outstanding, prices are great, cocktails and coffee are the bomb. Free flow water and the service is so nice.
We keep coming back!","This is a lovely little restaurant with a cute outdoor dining area. They cater really well for vegans, vegetarians and for gluten intolerance. I had the best gnocchi I have ever tasted. The staff are great too. I will definitely be coming back to eat here again",Such a good restaurant! Very tasty food accompanied with super service by 2 girls ! Cannot recommend it more !!!! Definitely try their gnocchi they are very good ! Of you are searching for a place to go this is it !

Never expected such a lovely food under this roof.
Don’t go by the look of the restaurant it serve good food.
We were staying at japa bunglow and we walked down to this one looking review and it did not disappoint.
Go for it guys and best part he takes card because mostly remote places don’t take card and ask for cash.
They are open until 10pm so reach before time to grab it",Reasonable price and delicious food! Their Indonesian curry is very tasty! Portion size is very good. Their French Fries is a MUST TRY!  It gets really busy around 7:30/8pm.,"Butter chicken & gado gado was delicious! Calamari rings and fries was alright. Portion quite generous and price is reasonable.
Owner was friendly, took awhile to serve though as she was working alone.",Best curry we’ve had in all Indonesia! We came here 3 times and it was delicious each time. Prices are also very reasonable and the fruit juices very fresh. The owners are very kind. 100% recommend! Terima khasi!,"I really don’t know why it’s been empty every time we went there. The service is great, the food is cheap and very delicious.
The flavours are great and veggie options available.
We came back many times and would always recommend it to friends.
We tried the Cap Cay, fried Rice and curries and all the juices… would recommend all of it."

However, this place always has visitors, the price tags are very fair, cook quickly, the staff team is lively, cheerful and energetic people, the food is very, very tasty, so there are always a lot of Europeans :) I recommend not to look for a long time for your restaurant, but to go here straight away :)","As someone  who has been in Indonesia for 3 weeks, we were having quite some issues regarding food as the local food didn't really help us or our stomach.

The good thing about this place was most of the dishes were pretty much good and generic away from any local taste or any form of local influence.

We had the pizzas, steaks, pasta and juices , and we must say the cook ,kadek, had done an excellent job to maintain the taste.
Overall had a lovely experience and we had visited this lovely place multiple times. Would recommend for those who want generic but good food.

Cheers.","It's a family own restaurant located nearby the Port.
It's the best restaurant for chilling after all day roaming in Nusa.
We'd ordered Veg Pizza and Pineapple Smoothie, and to my surprise, both were perfect, nothing to complaint at all.
They also provided us complementary fresh food salad.

We've paid less than 200k/night, so we were a bit sceptical at first - why so cheap? And I am still asking myself the same question after staying. The whole building looks less than 1 year old, everything is exceptionally clean, the owners are just amazing and the breakfast is being served right in front of your room, on your own terrace table and chairs. Everything is very, very comfortable. Quiet during the night, but you can hear prayers from the temple in the evening. Good enough wifi. If it was double the price it'd still be worth every rupiah.","Arie’s guest house was great ! The owner (Arie) is so kind and welcome us like his family. He helped us regarding our trip, and recommend us many things to do. More than just an owner he helped us buying tickets, booked drivers, rent scooters. Our stay was amazing. The shower had hot water and was powerful, which is not something common on the island. I definitely recommend this place !","We choose Aries Guest House because it is a  clean little apartment. This was proved to be true during our 3 day stay. Arie, the host is very friendly and helps with the organisation of transfers and trips. He booked us a snorkling trip for a very good price. He can also provide some scooters in proper condition, which is a must have on nusa penida. The location is next the main road, but still pretty quit. There are some of the best tourust restaurant nearby.
In our opinion the bathroom could use a renovation (shower next to toilet, no separation and small basin), but it is still ok and clean, especially for the price. The bed and the AC in the room are in good condition.","We stayed with Arie for 5 nights, he was absolutely lovely! His Guesthouse isn’t on the ‘main street’, it’s about 10 minutes out of the town on a motorbike but it’s closer to the tourist attractions. Arie organised transport to and from the ferry for us and was always offering tea or coffee if we were hanging about during the day. The rooms were spacious and the bed was really comfy!","Everything at Arie guesthouse was perfect. Solot was the perfect host. The rooms were spacious and clean with a very comfortable bed. Breakfast every morning was great, and free water refill too! We also rented a bike for a very reasonable price. You can get to a lot of the main tourist spots from here by bike. Solot also booked our boat tickets to gili t and organised a taxi transfer to the ferry all for a very very reasonable price. If you are in Nusa Penida I would highly recommend Arie Guesthouse as your place to stay."

I've stayed in many similar places but this one is exceptionally good.

Also very clean comfortable room ( if you need they can give extra cleaning every day). Location is perfect and it's really quiet ( far from road noise) and peaceful natural place.","I booked this accomondation based on many positive reviews. I havent expected a luxury villa but for the first time, I ran away 5 minutes after our arrival. We entered the room and see bugs, spiders and huge spider net in the room. The owner did not say anything about that. Theres a 3cm huge hole under the door, no mosquito nets, so bugs will be sneaking in once you have the Light on. Also there an Electric cabel hanging from the wall. Im not writing this review in order to ruin the business of the owner but maybe some people from other nations wont be able to handle it, so just heads up...","We were looking for somewhere quiet with great views and some privacy, but still accessible by scooter to dive shops, restos and sites.  We could not have chosen better.  The views across to Bali and Mt Agung are uninterrupted, and within a short walk you can find western or local food - your choice.  The rooms are big, the beds comfortable, bathrooms have hot water, and each bungalow has its own private terrace to sit out in.  Warung and his family were most helpful, and simple breakfast on the balcony every morning was delicious and included in the price.  We felt very lucky to have found Mount Sea View and will tell everyone looking for a quiet, affordable place in Penida to go there!","Wonderful, quiet and green area. Rooms are spacious, clean and well decorated. Hosts are helpful. They serve tasty breakfast and you can enjoy a charming view of volcano in Bali - Agung. I highly recommend this place on your trips.","A beautiful, serene little part of Nusa Penida, hosted by the warm and friendly Wayan and his family!

The room was clean, bright and spacious. The outdoor patio gives you an excellent view of the surroundings, and the daily housekeeping is also very much appreciated 🙏🏼

It was a wonderful 4 nights. It was great to learn more about the Balinese culture from our chats.

I would highly recommend this place to stay if you are exploring Nusa Penida!"

They were really helpfull. Localisation is also great because near from speed boat.

Only inconvenience were the roosters we’ve heard all night but is normal because there are a lot of them in Nusa Penida.","Wow! The little houses & the people who work here and do literally everything for you (thank you so much) gave us the best stay ever! We booked via Airbnb and when we got here they immediately helped us getting scooters because there weren’t any others since they have a ceremony here on the island!
I would totally recommend and book again!","Unfortunately our room had some issues with the toilet. the stuff was very friendly. We have enjoyed the stay.

Can't ask for much more, especially for the price! Special thanks to the owner for helping us out with our luggage and for dropping us off to the harbour at such short notice.

- The room was really clean and decorated with flowers when we arrived with was really nice!
- She offers to prepare breakfast for 35k with different choices and give it to you on your balcony which is nice.
- There is a gate and it seems to always be people there so it felt safe.
- There is a really nice restaurant called Father Field Bistro at the corner (30 seconds away) which was the best food I ate in Indonesia.

Negative:
- The neighbors dogs were barking all night long and they were roosters nearby singing at 5 am.
- The shower only have maximum 5 minutes of hot water with no pressure.
- The AC was working but not the remote so we were not able to adjust it.",Novi was absolutely wondering. From greeting us to when we arrived till we left. The service was above and beyond and we felt comfortable away from home. Thank you so much for the help you gave us with our luggage. We felt a great relief to have a local assist us. Highly highly recommend! Also very affordable.,"The absolute sweetest owner! She was incredibly helpful, friendly and accommodating, and went out of her way several times to make our lives easier. She provided excellent communication via WhatsApp too! The room was very clean, and the location was peaceful. Location was also a great base from which to explore the island via motorbike.
There are some great restaurants close by, like Street Food!
Definitely book this place for your Nusa Penida stay, highly recommended:)"
