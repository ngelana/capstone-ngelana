I might come back one day when the weather would be better.
The way to get there is difficult but Bastian is an amazing guide ü•∞ and it's worth the trip !!!","The waterfall was beautiful and magnificent.
Would highly recommend a raincoat and a good pair of shoes as the path to the waterfall is very slippery.","We got this place to ourselves.  Very big,nice waterfall.  Bit of hassle from sellers on way down but not much bother.","Stunningly beautiful stepped mountain climb to get to this majestic waterfall, even the view on the way of the sweeping jungle can be breathtaking.
Be warned that it's an unsafe climb for a decent amount of time. While it has concrete steps the whole way some of it has no railing and the steps are steep enough to challenge even a healthy short person, a friend with a limp barely made it.
Couple this with the fact that you will be bombarded by vendors the whole way and the whole thing does feel slightly devalued.
Still, the serene beauty at the bottom is unparalleled and the locals are at least respectful of the space enough to allow a little bit of quiet meditation.","Nice waterfall near the desa Gitgit. I took the last entree to the waterfall with the short route which still is a climb. Not for those with short breath. On the way to the waterfall you pass Teak, Gloves, Durian among other trees."

The humidity of the jungle, and all together.
And the best is just us, no one there.
Tips : becareful a bit with the steps, as still original but that's the best part üòä‚ú®Ô∏è",Dukuh waterfall worth a look. Cost me 50k for ticket. Guy asked if I needed a guide for another 50k. I said no. He walked me around temple and showed me start of path to falls. About a 10 to 15 min walk across field then a descent down to falls. A bit steep in places so just take care. Waterfall looks good. Standing close you feel the spray. Sounds good as well. Hike back up is good for the cardio.,Nice tracking area good view beautiful waterfall and the best thing is the jumping point! Very natural love it.,Gitgit is back to NORMAL.,This is very nice place and natural waterfall.

This is the first place till now in Bali that served a real cappuccino and altough I dont mind drinking traditional bali kopi, a cappuccino made of Balinese coffee was just absolutely delicious!! People working there are also very nice. And seems like they care about their dog which for me shows they are a good people. I am a big dog lover and it is very sad for me how dirty, sick and neglected dogs here are and their dog was actually first I dared to stroke. Maybe is not important for others when they go to have a coffee but for me that was a plus as well :)",,,

We had a trip to gitgit waterfall and our driver recommended us this place (i'm pretty sure he was also part of this scam). The prices in menu are pretty decent, but they recommended us some balinese food and we chose ""chicken satay"". This was not in the menu, but it is a verry common specialty in bali, and you can have it at almost all restaurants in bali for 35-65k IDR. In the end they charged us 110k + taxes for each portion. Also, the cuttlerly was very dirty and the bathroom was full of ants.","Spice paradise bali is very nice for stay if you find the beauty of nature, you can see alot of waterfall near here. just walking around 10 minute you can find gitgit waterfall.",A cosy little hotel situated in Gitgit. Nestled amongst 7 waterfalls. Worth the stay. Food is fantastic.,They recommend stuff that is not on the menu and is way more expensive than the rest of the items. And not specialties. Normal items like Chicken Satay that you can find quite cheap pretty much everywhere else.,"best stay in north bali, we can enjoy the time to see waterfall and forest nearby here."

The menu was very small. There were people banging hammers inside the same building we were eating in, which was beyond annoying. The food was okay, nothing spectacular or unique. We left early because I wasn't feeling very well (was thinking it was the food). About halfway through our motorbike ride back to Lovina, my wife tells me she doesn't feel well and proceeds to vomit.
