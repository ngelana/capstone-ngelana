Happy to choose this hotel for vacation. Have a wonderful pool in the middle. De Topaz restaurant is nearby and delicious foods they have. Rooms are very clean. Only thing you need a vehicle to go somewhere little distance from center but this is not a problem they have good offers for motorcycles. Quiet and peaceful ‚úåüèª.,Lovely small hotel. The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Rooms are excellent. The gardens are beautiful and it is very peaceful. The restaurant provides good service and food. You will need transport as the hotel is about 15 mins ( make that 20-30mins if traffic is bad and you are in a car).,"This was our favorite stay in Ubud!
It is a bit outside Ubud, but then makes it easier to visit nature in the north.
The place is super new, clean and staff is amazing. So accomodating and make you feel at home.
They have done a good job in preserving the nature around and integrating, so the whole place feels very calming and inviting.
Absolutely reccomend this place!
Much love from Aladin & Aldina",Pretty nice hotel. Everything is clean. The lobby is big with nice touch. The room is facing the pool and several rooms have direct access to pool. The pool is long and quite big for the guests. There are day beds and chairs provided by the pool. The staffs are super nice. The lady in the reception and the man who help us bring our luggages are super friendly and dedicated. They have ala carte breakfast that you can choose 1 day in advance. It is located in the topaz cafe just right in front of the hotel. We really enjoy our time here. It takes around 20 minutes to downtown ubud,"I definitely have a pleasant stay here. Drive here from airport took around 1 hour time. Found it tucked in a little alley, yet still spacious enough for cars to get into.
The ambience is lovely, their lounge area is relaxing and the hotel property is facing its cafe / breakfast area. We also had great time in their 15x4 sqm area pool.
Service is top notch, they treated all guests with same standard, polite & friendly. They also gave us some travel tips for our next trip.
Option for breakfast is indeed limited but we thoroughly enjoyed it, especially the fresh veggies & omelette. Go try local dish for breakfast, way better than just bread & jam üòâüëå
Room is pretty comfortable for our stay. Mind you this is not a 5 star property, but it has everything you need for. Bed was super comfortable. Improvement can be done for shower/ toilet as we need to fully turn the exhaust on to prevent any damp smell.
Overall still a 5/5 experience ü§ç"

Staff were super friendly and helpful. Really enjoyed the room we were in and also enjoyed the breakfast in the morning. Able to rent a motorbike to explore ubud‚Äôs hidden gems. The center is a 20 minute ride but with traffic i would say 30 minutes more or less. The bed is comfortable and the airconditioning works well. The bath looks beautiful but there is not enough hot water to fill it up and the plug doesn‚Äôt fit very well. The shower how ever is really nice.

We were super happy! Thank you so much for everything.",Really nice and clean houses combined with luxury. Also the workers are very nice. Forgot my phone at the villa and got contacted emidiatly that it was there in a safety box. So 5 stars overall. ( and food very nice üòâ ),"Me and wife had a wonderful experience staying at Canvas Escape resort. The rooms were cozy, the beds were very comfortable and there was a smart tv in the room. Upon our arrival, the staff were nothing but amazing. The resort ambiance was wonderful and gave us a sense of glamping and was away from the noise of the streets.  The delicious breakfast was included daily, and  it was a variety of items to choose from on the menu. The Villa also gave us the option to have breakfast delivered to our room. Additionally, for New Year‚Äôs Eve, the staff gifted us with a thoughtful NYE gift which was so nice! Furthermore we booked a massage through the villa and the masseuses were amazing. One of the best massages me and my wife had!

Some of the cons we noticed were the ants in the bathroom and the noise of the roosters outside in the garden in the early mornings. We had a lizard in our bathroom that paid frequent visits, however, the staff was very swift to get it out.

I get all we would recommend Canvas Escape to anyone vacationing in Ubud, Bali",Excellent place in Ubud.. so calm.. so romantic.. nice pool.. better to bring food outside if you want to eat late night as the hotel takes last order by 7:00pm apart from that it‚Äôs a very great place to stay and enjoy the resort.. we were there 5 days and no trouble at all..,"Property is very good. Good for couple getaway. Staff is very friendly and caring. We did have few small issues like shower gel was not coming out, room lock was getting stuck but when we asked staff they immediately resolved it. Pool area is ok-ish. Bathrooms are just wow, definitely amazing for couples. Everyday staff asked for bf menu and even they prepared early bf boxes for us as we had to travel early that day. Stay is a bit outside of ubud market but with the price we paid it was good stay overall"

However I think it's not worth it coz the room is not clean. The bathroom is so messy and it seems not well managed.
The only good point of this hotel is it's located in good location not too far from Ubud.
There's only 1 staff to maintain the hotel and handle customers, so I can understand why it's so messy.
I think better to avoid this hotel if you're looking for a comfortable hotel to stay.","This place is very recommended for you who search for comfortable stays with affordable price. The building is new, the room is spacious and comfortable, with AC and hot water shower.  They provide towel, shampoo and soap as well. The staff is friendly and helpful. It's close to Monkey Forest and other tourism object in Ubud. We enjoyed our stays here.","Building seems new, not much of a view, but very quiet at night despite facing the road. 20mins motorbike ride to Monkey Forest. Hot water TV and aircon working well. Would have been nicer if they provide somewhere to hang clothes and wet towel. Plenty of parking for motorbike. But not sure why, nobody at check-out in the morning.","Absolutely horrible experience with the most Arrogant staff. Super dirty. Pee on the sheets and dirty toilet. Cold water on the shower. Please do not book here. It was terrible.
Horrible.","Nice, clean and friendly staff. Bed and bath only ,,, just what we need and very economical."

Sami's hospitality was exceptional, going above and beyond to ensure a comfortable stay. From personalized recommendations to thoughtful gestures, it was evident that Sami genuinely cared about making my time enjoyable. The homestay itself was cozy and well-maintained, providing a homey atmosphere. I highly recommend Sami's place for a warm and welcoming accommodation experience.","Excellent place to stay. The pool is super clean and refreshing, rooms are clean with great A/C and hot/cold water. The breakfasts are delicious. Just outside of the main strip of Ubud so there‚Äôs not very much traffic or noise. Scooter rentals through them were very easy and cheap. Sami (owner) and his staff are incredibly kind, helpful and hardworking. Sami is very well respected in the local community and for good reason. He cares so much about preserving Balinese culture and sharing it with his guests. Stay here if you are visiting Ubud. Thanks Sami!"

The room is clean, with a pool view. There are only 4 rooms in total, thus the pool won't be crowded. In fact throughout my stay, we had the pool for ourselves. We had a lovely host with a great hospitality. This property is located in Lodtunduh, 20 mins away from City Centre, thus you need a taxi or bike rental to move around. Very quiet, peaceful and serene environment. It comes with breakfast and an option to upgrade to floating breakfast with a very minimal fee.","Definitely recommend this place in Ubud to stay. These 4 villas are such a hidden gem with a pool view. The beautiful and well-maintained villa looks great as seen in the picture, very clean and cozy. The staff was polite and friendly. The breakfast was tasty and fulfilling. We were happy to stay here for 3 nights. Thank you so much Wayan!","We enjoyed our stay. The room was really clean and we liked the outdoor shower! Excellent communication and the staff are super friendly. They also offer floating breakfast (additional 100k) but we couldn‚Äôt do it because it was raining on our last day there. The only thing that can be improved is the lighting in the room, it is a bit difficult for girls to do makeup.",The room is great and very clean. There are only 4 rooms so it realy quite. The swimming pool is also nice. The location is not far from central ubud but it cannot reach by walk. You can rent the motorcycle for Rp. 75k. The owner of the villa is very nice. They also provide simple breakfast. We choose fried rice and banana pancake which was very good.,The villa area was beautifully set out and all villas had a nice view of the pool which had a relaxing waterfall.

If it is not because of awesome service from Mb Tri who hosting us,I think I might give the experience below 3 stars overall. The room is as what it shown during the booking, but we are not expecting the toilet will not have bidet, since we are traveling still within Indonesia. I think the location will be great for people who looking for serenity and travel without luggages (i.e. backpacking). Recommended not driving car while staying here since the parking area is very limited and being shared by other houses around.","This is a beautiful hotel, a real hidden gem. Go here for a quiet and relaxing stay. For those who are less familiar with nature you may find some ants here and there, as well as a cockroach on occasion. This is not due to lack of cleanliness, but being in an indoor outdoor space. The bed is very comfortable, internet is fast, A/C is cold, and at night it is so peaceful. The bathroom is huge, the bedroom is a little smaller than I would prefer only because we had a lot of luggage. The pool is cold at night, so I would only recommend to swim during the day. You may need to skim the pool with the net nearby, otherwise it is very clean. The host is incredibly sweet, kind, and speaks very good English. Laundry service is cheap too, very good service. Clean clothes within 24 hours. :)

These are very honest people, and this mini hotel is beautiful. Do not expect perfection, but expect a habit that allows relaxation.

The only thing I would change is a small dusting job, and some non see through curtains on the first floor rooms so people cannot see me nude. ;)","Indeed secluded area, nice view, you might able to go shooting stars behind the paddy fields. The swimming is murky, I don‚Äôt see anyone dipping inside. A little bit dusty, cleanliness can be improved, some ants nest in the bathroom. Far away from busy streets. Foods take a little bit longer than usual to prepare. I don‚Äôt recommend eating here. Overall, it‚Äôs a pleasant stay. Recommended.",Host was very helpful and provided everything we need from laundry services to motorbikes. Great value for money and very peaceful location.

The room was serviceable for the price we paid for them.

The checking-in process took an excruciatingly long time. And when we were finally shown to our room, they realized the power to the room wasn't working. We were made to wait another 20 to 30 minutes before we could get the room.

The staff were friendly and courteous enough.

There is a little bike park near the entrance in case you're bringing a rented scooter.",Nestled amongst beautiful surroundings our villa was a haven. So peaceful and relaxing. Traditional open plan layout with a modern feel. Pool was perfect size for our family of five. Restaurant food was fantastic. Service also wonderful. Free shuttle bus to Ubud which is approx 15 mins away. Only negatives was lacking in kitchen equipment such as crockery and basic appliances. Also the sofa needed to be replaced as it wasn't very comfortable and quite dirty. Decking also needs to be replaced around the pool as warped. Beds and bathrooms lovely. All in all a wonderful place to stay üòä,"Stayed two nights in a private villa, the  villa was great, and the staff were great.
The floating breakfast is a must and a unique way to enjoy your private pool.

Place is a little too far away from anything, but they run a shuttle which is good.","Best place for a weekend gateway with family and friends. This resort is very spacious and well divided into studio rooms, deluxe rooms and private pool villas. I stayed here for 3 nights in private villa. It was an amazing experience staying there. In house restaurant offers variety of menu with covering local as well as international cuisine with some lip smacking cocktails. Service here is very prompt and they have so much to offer.
