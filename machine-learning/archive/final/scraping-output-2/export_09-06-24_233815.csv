Beautiful tents- everything made with the highest quality materials. The bed comfort level, sheets, towels, and even bath soaps. We stayed at Stream, and it was really by the stream. I can't express just how wonderful it felt to sleep or read in this tent while fully immersed in nature and hearing the birds and stream nearby. Moreover, the food was outstanding and very high quality. Service was impeccable. My partner proposed to me in this tent, actually. He was waiting for the right inspiration and this was it. Peaceful, beautiful and simply delightful in every way.  I cannot recommend this place enough. Ill definitely be back!","This place was an absolute dream to stay at. While we were there we had both thundering storms and Sunny‚Äôs days and either way it was one of the most enjoyable stays we‚Äôve had in Bali.

The staff were very attentive, all the food was farm to table and the view from our Mountain View room was the best thing to wake up to every morning.

If you‚Äôre staying in Bali I would highly recommend Nadi Nature Resort. Thanks me later!",Stayed here last week for a last minute get away. The food was out of this world and plenty of choice for me as a meat eater and my vegan girlfriend. The rooms are really spacious with super comfortable beds in a beautiful setting. Will definitely be going back :),"During our stay in Bali, we stayed in several places, but definitely Nadi Nature Resort stole our heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
If you are looking for a perfect place to relax this is it!
Very delicious food, nice and helpful staff and Breathtaking surroundings.","Amazing stay in the jungle of Bali! We stayed in the Waterfall tent (which has a bathtub ‚ù§Ô∏è) and had an incredible experience, mixing comfort and nature views and sounds. The staff are so kind, always here to help with anything! I don't even need to mention the quality and diversity of the food you can get there with a view of the volcanos of course! Can't recommend more!"

Nadi is a true haven nestled between mountains, waterfalls, and rice fields. My two-night stay felt like a dream - a tranquil escape from the chaos of daily life.

The owners, warm and welcoming, turned my visit into an unforgettable experience. Their genuine hospitality made Nadi Resort feel like a home away from home.

Surrounded by nature's beauty, waking up to the scenic views was a daily delight. The sound of waterfalls and the serenity of the rice fields created a peaceful atmosphere that rejuvenated my soul.

The food at Nadi Resort is a culinary masterpiece, reminiscent of the comforting flavors of home. Each meal was a nostalgic journey, leaving me craving more.

Whenever homesickness strikes, Nadi Resort is my sanctuary. It's not just a destination; it's a place of peace, warmth, and unforgettable memories. I can't wait to return to this slice of paradise. Nadi Farm Cafe, my home away from home!","we were blessed to have lunch at nadi farm cafe and it was truly one of he best meals of our 3 week honeymoon around bali. the ingredients are so fresh, and my fully vegan 3-course meal was bursting with flavor - everything is prepared from local ingredients, even the spices and the cocoa beans! the red rice was delicious and filling, the eggplant exquisite, the service so welcoming and the location secluded and remote surrounded by nature. we will be coming back ‚ù§Ô∏è",the best dishes I've tasted in a long time! They ensure that every dish is prepared well and use the freshest ingredients straight from the farm. The Opor chicken & nasi goreng stands out in particular and the scenery is breathtaking. Must Must Try!!,"I've had the pleasure of visiting this place several times now, and each visit has been an absolute delight! It's definitely a hidden gem! The view is simply stunning, and the food & beverage never fails to exceed expectations. Trust me, it's a culinary experience you won't want to miss!
And yes, now I'm craving to have Nadi's foods again :D
I'll definitely be coming back again and again!","What a wonderful hidden gem we found in Nadi! A peaceful oasis surrounded by rice fields and gorgeous views.
