Especially the part with technology. This place is definitely worth to visit!",The introduction is very great. It will let you know more history and culture in Bali. Also the spirit! ü•∞ I want to give it 6stars.,"I visited this place weeks ago, learn a lot about Balinese Culture, especially correlation between Architecture, Spirituality, and Balinese royal Etiquette. The Governmental system also clearly showed if you noticed really carefully. The dark side of this place... At the time when the king commited suicide in 1908, and talks about Hinduism with cold head.. And we talks about Spiritual Energy, and also.. A bit of Reincarnation concept. It's really interesting, and could make an idea to start a novel or a book.

Because I am eager to travel alone (since I am an introverted guy) I looked like a nut guy.. But i take the chance anyway ü´£ and the girls who guided me is really attentive.., which she should be promoted I mean.. seriously!","It was the best dive in the history, culture and religion of Bali island we have had on the island!
The guid was super professional!
So interesting!
We spent with him 2 hours!
Definitely THE place to visit!","What an amazing excursion into the past rich culture of Bali, still lingering on until today. The guide Arya, explained everything very well and in impeccable English, we learned so much. The very tasty traditional meal afterwards completed this unforgettable experience! A huge thank you to my friend Panji Astika, the successor of the former king."
