Kuta Sel., Kabupaten Badung, Bali 80364, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=13458810559621731687,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 8468468,resort_hotel,"resort_hotel, wedding_venue, event_venue, hotel, lodging",4.7,5930,,"The rooms are immaculate,  beautiful decor, comfortable beds, great breakfast buffet. The seclusion of the property is attractive and creates for spectacular view, whether it's forest,  ocean or garden. Some minor flaws are the TV position isn't centralized in the room so you'd have a sore neck if watching TV from the bed after couple hours.  The seclusion of the hotel (specifically between buildings) causes phone signal to disappear l, so just be weary if walking around outside the hotel area.","WOW! I loved everything about Rimba by Ayana, the staff, tram service, spa options, food, views, wet towels, room, bed, baby cot, shower/bath was all perfect. I definitely want to save up and return again. The one thing that really stood out for me was the staff, it didn't matter who the staff were, it could be the pool staff or house keeping staff and they were all so friendly and kind at the same level. I felt very comfortable and happy.

Thank you!","I have been to Bali many times and this is the best place I have ever stayed. The service is impeccable, all of the staff are incredibly lovely and they did absolutely everything they could to make our stay so special. Unique rooftop bar is a must do at sunset for a swim and a cocktail. Thalassotherapy was a great activity. Rock bar and the beach was beautiful. Cannot recommend this place enough. We will definitely be coming back.","We stayed here for 5 days for our wedding anniversary and it’s a remarkable resort. The resort is HUGE with multiple hotels in a large area. There are 20+ restaurants and 14+ pools!

The resort is away from main areas of Uluwatu so if you’re interested in exploring the area you’ll need to hire a driver to take you around since it’s far from everything and the resort itself is like a city!

We liked the variety of restaurants and walked around on our first day to get a feel of the space. The resort is walkable and you can also take the shuttle.

We loved Kubu beach that’s the resorts private beach. We also enjoyed our overpriced drinks at The Rock Bar and it’s totally worth making a reservation and going at 5pm for the sunset.

The food at the resort is very expensive so if you want to save a bit of money you can use Grab to deliver food for you and also go to Pepito’s to get some groceries or snacks/drinks.

We loved the Thalassotherapy pool and strongly recommend it for some relaxation and restorative powers.

What was unusual for me personally was how some women were dressed as if they were attending the Academy Awards even though it was just to go to a busy breakfast buffet. I felt underdressed so if you want maybe bring 1-2 dresses so you can dress up if you want! I don’t wear makeup so I definitely felt out of place however since it’s so hot and humid I don’t know how these women were able to make sure their hair and makeup stayed put!

Overall it’s a nice resort and I would recommend it. It’s very kid friendly and family friendly. I love kids but if you want a quiet romantic place with no kids then this is not the resort for you even if you hangout in the “adults only” sections.","We recently stayed at the Rimba by Ayana in a Resort View Suite (2x families of 4, including young children under 4yo) for 8 nights.

Firstly, the estate as a whole is absolutely breathtaking! Every inch is seriously stunning and like nothing we had ever seen before in all our trips to Bali and other parts of the world.

The welcome to the hotel was very warm, however the warmness didn’t carry through many of our other interactions with hotel staff for the duration of our stay. Other interactions were polite, but not what we are use to in Bali with super friendly staff who are happy to go above and beyond to make your stay memorable.

The food for us was average.
The buffet breakfast at TeGo was great! Lots of choices, fresh, and very friendly/ helpful staff. They even have koi fish feeding for the kids which was a hit!
Sami Sami and Danmar were both family friendly in terms of menu and outdoor seating (probably really the only ones?) and the food was good.
Scusa is such a beautiful restaurant and staff were great with the kids - the food was delish.
Honzen unfortunately disappointed with the menu items we chose.
We couldn’t find a decent coffee anywhere and I feel like the hotel is targeting the Western market with their current advertising campaigns so I think decent coffee is a must.

The pools are stunning, very aesthetically pleasing, and there are plenty of them! They looked and felt clean however I wouldn’t consider them family friendly - maybe for older kids but not younger. Many of them are adults only also.

We took a travel stroller and often our baby was sleeping in it, so rather than catching the tram and having to fold down the pram/ wake the baby, the concierge helped arrange for buggy transport for us between the resorts/ facilities which was a huge plus and super helpful!

There are LOTS of steps throughout the estate and garden bed edges with “drops” as well as water with no fencing so it is quite difficult to easily move around with kids - it was fine for us but logistically it took a long time to move from place to place.

There are two kids clubs - the one at the Ayana is better than the one at the Rimba which was a shame because it seems that the Rimba is more targeted towards families with kids. An upgrade to lighten and refresh the Rimba kids club would fix this.

We used the hotel baby sitting service once for 3 hours, and were very happy with the baby sitter and service as a whole! Would recommend.

Lastly, our room. It was spacious and big enough for the 4 of us, including a play pen that we hired.. however relative to the price, It was very underwhelming otherwise. Most concerning was the mould in the bathroom behind the basin/vanity and in the shower; and the constant dampness in the room and mouldy smelling air-conditioning. We have been to Bali over 10 times, and at different times of year and we have never had this same mould or dampness in a room.
When we advised the reception of the issue, they advised they would ask the cleaning team to clean the mould. Two days later the mould still hadn’t been cleaned so we spoke to reception again and still no one came to clean the mould. We gave up after this.
This wasn’t isolated to our room as my sister also had the same issue with their room which was directly below ours.
At check out we advised them again of the mould and dampness and the staff simply said “thanks for the feedback” which was also underwhelming - it seemed as though they didn’t care generally speaking.

Ultimately we had a great family holiday but we wouldn’t recommend the Ayana to anyone with kids, and we wouldn’t recommend the resort view room at the Rimba due to the mould and dampness (not sure if it’s a whole-of-hotel issue?).
Next time we would probably chose to stay at the more family friendly 5 star resorts in Nusa Dua or Legian."

Everything in the room is excellent.

Questions about the stairwells, I don't really like to ride the elevator if you can walk down. I hit my head because the ceilings in a narrow place at a distance of 1.7 meters where from the floor. Strange that in 5* hotel did not hang a ribbon at least black and yellow for attention.

Also in the gym was hot and the air conditioning does not work.

Well, guys, it's not serious. For service 3 points.","The room is spaciously huge and comfortable.  Unfortunately the AC was not capable to cooling the room. They handled the complaint well and have very good service so far.
Nice breakfast, in addition their Indonesian food was very tasty and the restaurant staffs were very friendly.

The location was great and make this hotel being hidden gem that pretty close with the airport.","breakfast is one of the worst for a hotel - could have just served made-to-order Indomie, and it would've been better... mainly just ate the eggs, fruits and bread since you can't go wrong with these.

and our room was horrible:
- a lot of ants on the first night, but the housekeeping nicely cleaned them up.
- AC was really hot the first night. complained and said they fixed it. THEN AC stopped working completely on the third night at 2AM, which really disrupted our sleep since we didn't go back to bed till 4AM. although engineering kindly fixed it (although it took a while), the AC was still really hot after, or even the days after.
- door in front of our room kept banging open and close, being blown by the wind, pretty much every night.
- bathroom's light kept blinking as if it's having a seizure, even after they fixed it.

we complained about all of the above, even at 2.30AM when our AC was broken, but the front desk didn't even offer us a new room, EVEN after we asked in that moment at 2.30AM if we can just go to a new room rather than waiting for who knows how long for our AC to be fixed. new room was only offered on the next day, after we complained AGAIN, in which we we were already too lazy to move out since we were checking out the following day","first, kudos to the amazing staffs. however, this hotel loves to charge guests. for example, we spent more than IDR 13M / USD 800 for 4 nights villa stay, we were asked to pay for late check out fees if we stay beyond 1230 on a slow Monday with occupancy less than 50%. we were asked to pay for IDR 25K for a bucket of ice. All these are unimaginable for a 5-star hotel. I've traveled to more than 30 countries and stayed in more than 150 hotels, I've not encountered anything like this before. this is too low for a 5-star hotel, because even 4-star hotels don't charge like that.","The room is big and nice. The breakfast unfortunately is not suitable for Europeans. Very few fruits (papaya, ananas and watermelon) everyday, no fresh vegetables. But there is a whole room with harmful gluten baked goods.."

The service at Ayana is the best service I have experienced in Bali. The workers are SO friendly and nice and accommodating. Was there for the Sunday Mexican Fiesta and that was phenomenal! The tacos, margs, fajitas YUM! 100% recommend this Sunday unlimited taco deal to anyone!","This was by far my favorite place at Ayana Resort, next to Padi.

The Mexican food is excellent and you get a lot of food for the price, which is also affordable.

We went once for dinner where there was live music which was excellent too.
And once for lunch with a voucher for a 3 course meal.

Take notice that for lunch there will be children playing in the water, so if you're sitting next to it, you might get splashed a bit.","We need to reccomend this bar/restaurant to everyone who is searching for a really good food, great drinks but, the service here is stunning - Apsari - this girl was amazing, and the Barman was also really great. Thank you so much guys that we were able to enjoy this experience with you, hopefully we will visit you again next year :-)","Friendly staff
If you tell them you want to just take pictures you can walk in you don't need a reservation no problem.

There's live music playing

If you want to go for a swim you can swim while drinking the night.

Unique bar (amazing environment at rimba resort: has hookah, night pool/swim, hand craft drinks, food)
May need reservation

Didn't try the food or drinks

My experience from the main resort that drinks and food were decent. The better quality food would probably be the Indonesian dishes. I say that's because they serve tapas or Mexican cuisine but coming from Los Angeles the quality is probably not the same.

Need to come to Mexico more even San Diego to compare the quality.
If they did fusion, that would be more acceptable or worth a try."

The highlight dishes were the sautéed minced garlic morning glory, yanzhou fried rice and jumbo prawn with vermicelli in XO sauce. Service was also impeccable! Despite the heavy price tag, it is well worth the price.","Ah yat abalone seafood restaurant is located with in the Ayana Resort specifically at Rimba by Jimbaran. You do not have to be staying here to eat at this restaurant.

They have a wide array of dim sum for A La Carte or you can choose all you can eat for $39 Aud or 390,000 IDR.

Back in Australia I’m used to dimsum being 4 pieces per servings for dumplings but it didn’t matter as we ordered quite abit which gave us more variety.

Everything is made fresh to order and is very delicious, would recommend to anyone wanting a dim sum fix in Bali.","We were in Bali for the Bali Major Dota 2 competition.
This is the nearest resto aside from the one inside the hotel that has slow service.

I remember saying this is where I tried my best congee. It's just so good I finished 3 bowls.
Their dimsum is also quite good. It's not cheap but it's all worth it. If you are in the are this resto is a must-try.

If ever given a chance to visit Bali again, will go back to this restaurant.","One of the best meals in bali, and Bintang, Robert and the staff were superb - friendly and professional without being too in your face like some other places.
Half pecking duck and seafood fried rice is a must."

Went to this highly rated and esteemed hotel for dinner at the To'ge restaurant. Ordered the Bali Pizza and received a FLY baked into the dough of the pizza.

Extremely shocked to have this happen at such a prestigious hotel. Sick to my stomach. I almost didn't notice this, so who's to say what other unhygienic things go unnoticed.

Other dishes came very late as well. All of our party except one had received their food and another was made to wait another 15 minutes.

Once we had made the staff aware of this issue, and after on and on negotiations the restaurant has said they will give us this meal for free.
Weak apology and disappointed at the staff's response.

Please do not go here if you value hygienic, and well prepared food.","While staying at Rimba, we tried this restaurant out one night and found it good to eat at.

The service was good, though when I ordered a fresh coconut, they brought me a coconut husk with no coconut water inside. I don't know what happened there.

We ordered some lamb, some pizza, nasi gorend and some other food and it was good, not excellent but good.

It could be just me expecting a little more considering we were at Ayana reports.","Visited during busy time but loved to be there. Every staffs were welcoming and felt very cared. They remembered everything what I said and kept interacting. Especially appreciate the service by Yoga and Dipo in To’ge restaurant, and chef Ari that came to my dinning table while I was eating, for the extra care and hospitality. The food is of course amazing, no doubt. I had Soto ayam this time.","Very expensive breakfast buffet, after all taxes it was $100 NZD for two people. The reason I give 3 stars to the food as we tried breakfast buffets in Sofitel and Apurva Kempinski in Nusa Dua. It was same expensive but food and drinks quality was much better, as well as they had way more options... Also, a little tip, if you want to save on buffets include breakfast when you book a hotel, this way it cost much less, like about 50% less.

The quality of the cocktails is excellent, much better than many restaurants, not diluted with water beyond recognition, but clear flavor as it should be.
There is a wonderful fish soup on the menu with a bright and rich flavor, big chunks of fish and shrimp.

I did not like the slow service and the order in which my husband and I were brought out our dishes. We ordered two dishes per person, but brought out both of mine first and he hungry had to just watch! A restaurant with a claim to hotel stars can't time the serving so guests don't feel awkward?

We had three breakfasts of completely different quality in the same restaurant. The first morning we were satisfied with a variety of both European and Indonesian dishes.

The next two mornings, on the other hand, were a disappointment. On one of them, the entire main meal consisted of pasta. There was pasta in the salad, as many as two different kinds of pasta in the main courses. The chicken curry is the driest I've tasted on the island. In the end there wasn't even any tasty rice as well as the other national dishes of the country. Indonesian cuisine is one of the world's tastiest, how can you not take advantage of that?
The variety of fruits is limited to papaya, pineapple and watermelon. Surely we are in the tropics? Go to the market, maybe you will find new things for yourself.

The most fat minus I put for the fact that for the staff serving breakfast coffee you have to run for them, you have to look for them to get your morning coffee. And if you want another cup, you have to run around looking for more.","The restaurant inside Royal Tulip Jimbaran, the ambience was nice, near the pool area, the view was great

The menu choice wasn’t too much, only local food, Indian food, Western food, bread selection, fruit and salad selection, sweets and pudding selection, egg station, chicken porridge station, cereal section, beverage for free is fruit juice, Bali coffee, tea and infuse water
