Friendly staff","Everything was excelent (food, service, atmosphere), just before we wanted to pay.
They have two different menu (with indonesian and british flag). We ordered from indonesian one - the price in this menu is ok (normal as in all warungs in Bali, Java). When we wanted to pay, man opened the english menu and the prices there were  more then three times higher. I can't believe it, they just cheat turists!!!  I checked the indonesian consumer protection law and international agreements signed by  Indonsian goverment and now I know that it is also against law. Its just discrimination. When someone do this in Europe, the Consumer Office give the restaurant fine higher than  60000 euro. I Hope that goverment here in Indonesia will do something with it.
So if you decided to visit this place just ask them about indonesian menu."
