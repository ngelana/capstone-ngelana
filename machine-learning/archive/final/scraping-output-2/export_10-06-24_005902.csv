The Barong dance keeping the Indonesian tradition and culture alive.
They handout a storyline so you know what‚Äôs happening.
At the end of the show you can take a photo with them. Free
Entry fee: $150k (15.00AUD)","The community that runs this theatre is so hospitable and helpful. I reserved our spots for the morning via WhatsApp on the previous night. When we arrived half an hour early we were warmly received, personally toured and given some background, and two of the gamelan musicians set up early on stage to play for us until the rest of the guests arrived. A beautiful, thriving community enterprise, and we were so glad we got to see the Barong dance during our time here. What a stunning, fun and unique piece of living heritage! Don't miss this while in Bali!","for those who love dance and theatre, this place is highly recommended

but, the overall language used is Balinese
it is once in a blue moon you can listen to Indonesian and somehow, you cannot get the jokes uttered

when you take a picture with barong, you will have to give a tip, as Barong directly asks you while you were posing to take the picture

you dont have to worry about your seat as you can the ones besides the stages
you will see the actors and actresses closer

and if you want to get more, you can come to this area earlier to enjoy Balinese traditional music

what an experience!","Very recommend to visit . Awesome performance. The performance is being separated become 5 part,each part served by professional dancer . Nice place and also there is humour in every performance . Such unforgettable experience!","Beautiful cultural story dance, friendly dancer and staff, it's a pleasure to be here. Will be miss you all Barong Dance Putra Barong"

We stayed for one week, and we really want to come back when we'll be visiting Bali again. Semadi is also a very nice guy, he helped us with everything we needed.
The place is about 20 minutes driving from Ubud, so you will need a scooter in case you want to visit/ shopping, but Semadi will take care of this for a good price.","OMG! I love it so much!

I really missed Russian food so I wanted to try it out without too much expectation.

Good customer service.
I really missed borscht that I used to eat in Ukraine. When I went to the kitchen, they said borscht is currently not available. I showed my slight disappointment, and then the owner said he can cook cold borscht for me.
We were not used to Russian chocolate dessert, and the staff offered sample for us.  (Of course this was available since the restaurant was not busy at that time.)

And the food - OMG the cold borscht was sooooooo good! One of the best dishes I've tried. (I believe for Korean, it was similar to ÎÉâÍµ≠?)
Cottage cheese pastry was okay. I will definitely come back and try other dishes.

The only one star deduction is the dogs from the neighbours. Maybe we can tell the landlord to tame them a bit.",The food here was outstanding. So much so that we kept going back every day for the duration of our stay. No matter what we ordered it was delicious! The staff were also lovely.,"Best quality Granolas, Dried Banana Snack and Cinnamon Buns! With best price and great ambience and display too! We are lucky to find this culinary gem. Officially become a regular customer,,will come again,,and again!","I order whole-wheat bread from there and it is the most delicious I‚Äôve ever tried. It is full of seeds and various grains, fresh and full of taste. I recommend to try dumplings, homemade cereal, and baked pastries!!!","Best bakery in Celuk village near Ubud, it's situated inside the Dewi's Gold & Silver gallery. They have many great products, my favourite was their flaxseed bread, dried mango and granola.

They also deliver to Canggu with minimum purchase, definitely a must-try!"
