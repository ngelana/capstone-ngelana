ChIJnyX0ZqQx0i0RiAPl7XHniCQ,Sahaja Sawah Resort,-8.534822799999999,115.0296011,"Tegal Mengkeb, Selemadeg Timur, Tabanan Regency, Bali 82162, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=2632608458706584456,OPERATIONAL,+62 851-0074-7489,resort_hotel,"resort_hotel, hotel, lodging",4.6,341,,"The resort is about 2 hours away from the airport. It was my personal decision to stay far away from the tourist areas because we donâ€™t like busy crowds so the location was perfect for our family. We were able to go to many quieter tourist areas and avoid the bad traffic. The rooms are so clean, they come daily to sweep the floors. The service is wonderful, they are such nice and respectful people.","I went for 2 month at the Sahaja Sawah, the staff is incredibly lovely ! After 2 week you start to feel like at home with your Balinese family.

Now Iâ€™m sad to leave this place cause I find all the beautiful people I was looking for during this trip.

I recommend this establishment without hesitation.

If you are alone, in couple or in family.
Take some time here, you will not regret it.","Beautiful resort with wonderful staff! My only negative to my experience was that the location is very remote so please be mindful of this if you choose to stay here. It was lovely but the travel is at least 45 mins to Tabanan to go for a meal or go grocery shopping and then at least 1.5 hrs to get to Ubud and Canggu. Also, the price of the resort taxis are quite expensive and the taxi apps in Bali donâ€™t travel this far north.

It is lovely if you want to stay away from everything and never leave, or maybe just for a few days before staying somewhere else.

The experience I have to say was still great, staff are super friendly, food was great and the rooms were also great.","Checked in today for a weekâ€™s stay. They could come into my room in the middle of the night, steal my passports, beat me up, and Iâ€™d still give it five stars.

An incredible resort and the villa with a private pool is exceptional. Was not prepared for how special this place is.","Simply an incredible place! The Villas are modern while keeping traditional style. The kitchen are fully equipped. The pool is beautiful and well maintained. The surrounding is absolutely stunning. It is 1h from Canggu, lost in the rice terrace. The staff will organize almost everything for you: visa renewal, tours, trips to Ubud or Canggu. It is more than a resort, it quickly becomes a family."

Good thing they were in my hometown too, even tho it's kinda hard to come here (far and not an easy route). But really worth the hassle.

This was among the first crispy skin pig I've got when I eat out in a babi guling place. ðŸ˜­

All of them tasted so good. I got the jumbo one and cleaned my plate. ðŸ™ˆðŸ‘Œ

You should try this if you're nearby (or not). Really worth a visit and try.",,,,
