Food arrived fast, service is great, and food is also delicious. I tried the bakmie ayam jamur and their sambal is amazing.","Forgot to take a picture for our meals.
Husband is picky about food so he plays safe by ordering Yamien Jamur with Pangsit Kuah. The taste is not bad for him. I ordered Nasi Bakmoy Setengah Telur and it was fine although i imagine the soup will be garlicy-gingery and savoury turns out it' s garlicy which is fine. The problem is with Hakau, since my husband also has allergies with not-fresh-sea-food so he felt a bit itchy on his tongue. Overall it is a good place to have something warm while strolling Denpasar city.","One the best noodle in the heart of Denpasar, this one is originally from Bandung, West Java. I ordered Bakmi (Manis/Seeet) Rica Komplit, very tasty and the chilli level just right for me. It came with meatballs (you can choose from chicken, beef or fish) as well as meat filled tofu and wontons. The portion of the noodle is generous, definitely full after eating it.

My wife ordered Yamien (Manis/Sweet)Ayam Kecap, suit those who likes sweet type of noodles. If you prefer salty type you can choose (Asin/Salty), it will goes well with the Ayam kecap too!

We also ordered Tahu Kok, Bakso Goreng, Otak Otak Goreng . All of them were taste good. Bakso goreng is crispy inside out and it is served with sweet chilli sauce.

The place is inside a shophouse and they have tables outside too. Even though located on the road side, I found the place is very clean, the cutlery is covered so it wont get dusty. Parking is available on the road side, maybe it is easier to get a park during dinner because most the of the business in the area is closed after 5PM.

Will definitely comeback to try other menu.","The bakso goreng is tough , we can‚Äôt even chew it. Noodles is average taste.","Moved to Bali since 2017 and i never found any good bakso or bakmie stall that match my expectations.

Then here we are mie bakso Lidi, i came from west java and i finally found this place who sell a really authentic and tasty yet affordable mie yamin in town!
I also already tried a bunch of another stall for bakmie ayam, and the taste just so so.

I will come back here on and on! Juara!"
