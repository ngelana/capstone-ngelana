We spend a few nights in this Resort and it was truly a luxurious and wonderful stay. The Resort has an integrated organic farm where they produce the veggies and fruits for the restaurant. Not necessary to mention the food we tasted with this harvested product was delicious! The farm as well produces many different flowers! Our Luxury Farm Villa was one of the most luxurious places I have ever been and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. This resort is a quiet, relaxing and peaceful spot in an awesome location. The view from our terrace was breath taking and the nature surrounding is astonishing. While staying at Bagus Agro Pelaga we joined a few activities organize by the wonderful staff of the hotel. One morning we went to visit the near village where some of the Hotel staff are from. We had an amazing morning talking with the village people and trekking around their amazing lands. It was the most welcoming people I have ever met in Indonesia! In the afternoon we take a tour around the farm and we learnt a lot about all the farming process and the veggies and fruits. As well we take part in a coffee roasting class and later we have a wonderful coffee tasting experience. Absolutely wonderful experience. As well around the Resort there is a lot of activities to do and landmarks to see. The staff of the hotel is of this world and we felt treated as we were part of the Agro Pelaga family. Truly a wonderful experience.",The place is located in a Pelaga the north part of Badung. The resort has a very beautiful landscape and view. The staff are really friendly. Parking space a little bit tricky for car. Interior is unique with a Indonesian accessories placed on the table. Toilet is very clean. Food is good with Balinese spices but still edible for everyone.
