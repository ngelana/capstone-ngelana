Highly recommended for a memorable Halal culinary journey. I recommend to try Big Mujair Nyat Nyat, Nasi Sela and Es Temulawak.","It's our 2nd time visit here. Recommend for mujair nyat nyat,so delicious and fresh. you dont need to go to kintamani to get the good ones","We‚Äôre on our way to Ubud and was looking for a place to stop and eat. The place didn‚Äôt look convincing from the front but they have a seating out the back which makes you feel like you‚Äôre taken back in time. Eating in a wooden hut with traditional music in the background overlooking the nature & plantation.

Mujair nyat nyat was good. Nyat-nyat is balinese way of cooking the fish with lots of herbs combined with a little bit of sauce. Reminds me of Sundanese pesmol but a bit different in terms of herbs used.
Pricewise is very affordable.",loving the atmosphere here! i highly recommend all of you to taste the grilled fish because it reminds me of the spices on the grilled corn that i often eatü§§ü§§,"Bali Hidden Gem

Despite the place is very humble, the Mujair Nyat-Nyat Menu taste will  give your mouth an out of this world experience.

The XL size local Mujair Nyat-Nyat fish is well battered with Balinese herbs that alway on point. And the soup for you to squish the crisp but tender fish meat with will spoil your taste bud well.

While enjoy enjoy the fish, the rice combined with the fish soup and sambal matah that will also make your day even brighter.

And not to forget the vegetables, even it only a bit but still give you enaugh freshness after savoury bombs you have from the fish and sambal matah."
