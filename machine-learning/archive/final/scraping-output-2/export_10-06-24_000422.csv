Food is average and a bit over-priced for its quality tbh.  Even when you consider the view you get access to, it still feels a bit meh. Don't exactly feel I got ripped off because it's a buffet and you can eat as much as you want, but just don't get your hopes up on food quality.","This restaurant seems to target tourists, charging IDR 175k for the buffet plus a 20% service charge. This restaurant isn't listed in the itinerary. Worse, it's not halal, serving pork, and lacks bidets in the toilets. The IDR 200k for the giant swing is standard elsewhere. The view disappoints in the current rainy season. Consider filing a complaint with your agent, such as Klook, to address these issues and discourage such practices.","If you’d like to have a peaceful meal, this is the best place to go with a breathtaking rice fields view!

Food - all you can eat amazing buffet + a la cart available! I’d recommend to try everything!

Service - staff was lovely and very caring!

Swing - available at the back of the restaurant where you can take pictures (fee applied)","There is a good variety of food selections to choose from. Even as a vegetarian, I was able to fill up on some tasty food. The flavor of the food can  range from  mild to spicy. I strongly recommend the delicious fried bananas for dessert!!! The bat that stays outside of the restaurant was a pleasant surprise- have your cameras ready.","Ristorante Lereng Agung is a delightful culinary destination nestled in the heart of Bali, Indonesia.
