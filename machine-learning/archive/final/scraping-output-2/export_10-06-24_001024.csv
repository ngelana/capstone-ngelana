Nevertheless, I'd recommend finding a spot for trekking and walking along the terrace on your own. Some spots allow you in for free, while others charge an entrance fee of 25,000. Beautiful though!","Very photogenic location well maintained and staff will help you through to get the tickets for the entrance and for the activities as well but if you’re getting the activities purchased, you don’t have to pay extra for the entrance because it is already included. The prices are affordable I’d say and you can choose which activities you’ll have to do at the very beginning so you will be getting a tag on your hand for all the Participants. And they have a nice café and cocktail bar inside as well with the view and food. The beverages were pretty alright but the cocktails I’d say can be made into a bigger portions compared to standard cocktail sizes. It wasn’t that generous but food and beverages in general was good. They have few activities to swing and take photographs with nice Scenery and you can walk through the rice paddy fields and enjoy the nature.","A very touristic site, still I would recommend visiting it.
Keep in mind that since there are so many visitors, it makes taking beautiful pictures (which is the main attraction in my opinion when it comes to this place) quite hard, but still we managed to take some great shots.

There are also quite a few additional attractions you can pay for inside, like the swings or zipline, but we found they were redundant although the price wasn't too high in my opinion.

A quick visit could be nice, but when it started to rain we didn't have any place to hide so unfortunately we had to leave pretty quickly.","This is a perfect example of Balis' natural beauty being ruined by over commercialization. The terraces themselves are absolutely beautiful and worthy of a visit, but the surrounding restaurants, Bali swings, staff regularly cheering/shouting as part of swing pictures (like in my videos), and tons of people ruin the whole vibe. I would recommend skipping this and go to another less touristy place.","Beautiful place. Aside from the tourist area there are many restaurants along the rice fields that you can go to with amazing views. They have zip lines, giant swings, and other cool stuff for photos."

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality by the attentive staff. Their genuine smiles and willingness to accommodate made us feel right at home.

The ambiance of the cafe was inviting, with cozy seating and a pleasant atmosphere. It was evident that the staff took pride in creating a welcoming environment for their guests.

As for the food, it exceeded our expectations. Each dish was prepared with care and attention to detail, resulting in flavors that delighted our taste buds. Whether it was the savory sandwiches, the fresh salads, or the indulgent desserts, every bite was a culinary delight.","My family and I arrived early (10am) and had our choice of pool side lounges. They have a min spend of 400k per adult and 200k for children 6-15 (I think). We spent 4.5h and had a delightful time. Cool drinks, followed by lunch and cocktails. The quality of the food is incredible (and not expensive), the service personable & fast and the view amazing. Can’t recommend enough.","Epic spot, staff were super friendly and the food was lovely! An amazing view without all of the tourists. We arrived around 10:00am and it was the perfect time. We had the pool to ourselves for atleast 2 hours. Highly recommend:)","The restaurant is beautiful and in a great location with a direct view of the rice terraces. There is also a large pool and two swings. :-) We were only here for lunch and therefore cannot rate the pool.

The service was great throughout the restaurant - both at the reception upstairs and the waiters. I am currently on crutches, so it was a bit tricky with the spiral staircases in the restaurant, but it all worked out.  The staff were super helpful, nice, courteous and attentive from the very first minute. :-)
We had very tasty food, cocktails at happy hour and dessert for a fair price. Everything was more than delicious and absolutely recommendable! We were even asked about allergies.

We can wholeheartedly recommend the restaurant and will definitely come back on our next trip to Bali. :-)","The food was amazing and there was a nice relaxing area. I went earlier morning in May and it was not to busy but later on it started to get busy so I left.
Eating right in front of the rice fields was great. The place is clean with the best view in the area"

Be prepared to walk up many flights of stairs if you’re heading down to see a closer view of the rice terrace.

It was also 400K per couple for the swing which i think it was reasonably priced.","If you dine, the entrance fee will be waived. If not, prepare to pay IDR 50K for entrance.

Food is savoury but the price is a bit steep. You'll get to enjoy the rice terrace view while dining.

Staff are accommodating and can speak English.

Food takes around 10 to 20 minutes to be prepared and served.

Came here just to eat and dine. If you're after the rice terrace view, make sure to go during the wet season since that's when they will start plowing the fields and start planting.

Visited November 04, 2023","Tegallalang you can go for the swi g with or with out the dress. There are multiple swings and nests

For the view you can even sit at the restraunt order good food and enjoy or walk don't the terrace to see the rice fields.
Across the terraces you can also zip line.","Nice Bali swing.

They have a large area with multiple types of swings.

They offer organized valet parking.

They are quick and no long waiting time.

They have a cafe / restaurant overlooking the rice fields.

No crazy queues nor was it very busy. We went around late may.
There is cafe that serve some food.","This is commercialised place, good for people who want some adrenalin with the huge swing. Recommended to go earlier during the day for more beautiful views on the rice fields. There is an also very good zip lining available. Lot of photo ops available but carry water as it gets dehydrating while walking around in mild cloud covered day also.","Tickets priced at 25,000 rupiah each.
Many steep steps, tread carefully.
If you don’t want to walk around, you can wait at the cafe around here. Drink a nice refreshing coconut.","Very underwhelmed and touristy. As soon as you enter the road leading to the rice field, there will be a bunch of shops that offer free parking, and some tell you to buy tickets just to see the rice field. There’re some coffee/shops even charge a small amount to cross the ridiculous bridge (made of a stick lol) to the other side. And no one actually checks the ticket I bought earlier so don’t buy anything there. The rice field is underwhelming with locals constantly trying to get you pay for the swing, very annoying.
Come to Vietnam Northern area in September/November to see the real rice field. It’d take your breath away.",Amazing view awesome location.. one of the main attraction of Ubud area in Bali.. quite far from the city but worth every penny you spent for visiting here..

Amazing family that run the place, that are so helpful and informative. 1000% recommend over any other rice terrace in Bali!! There is a reason they have 5 stars all round","Beautiful, a classic Bali view, steep steps but ample parking and places for refreshment 🌸

✅ plenty of parking for scooters on the road, but make sure you secure them well as it’s on the edge of a sheer drop!
✅ many restaurants for refreshments
✅ ample photo opportunity spots provided
✅ the actual rice terrace walks were pretty empty, only a handful of people actually decided to go does and walk amongst them

❌ you will be hassled by children and other street sellers to buy things, which is very upsetting to deny them a sale, and uncomfortable
❌ the restaurants are expensive
❌ very exposed to sunlight, obviously. Please bring a hat and sun cream and stay hydrated!
❌ not appropriate for people with mobility issues. There are makeshift steps down in many cases, no handrails and uneven ground

Tip:
Just a little further up the road from the very busy clubs and restaurants, I found an abandoned building that had safe stairs leading down to a completely empty platform. This gave me respite from all the crowds and arguable the best view of the terraces without having to fight to the death for it!"

This spot doesn't come up on Grab maps but we ordered by putting in rice terraces then asked our driver to go to this spot instead. The dirt paths are maintained (they were still working on parts of it) but can quickly become slippery and muddy throughout the rice fields. I wore hiking boots but saw lots of people in sandals and thongs, they had a bit more trouble esp in the more steep parts - definitely not the most accessible if you have mobility issues.

We are glad that we discovered this place for ourselves, I highly recommend it to those who want to settle in the vicinity of Ubud.","Epic view from the balcony! Was pleasantly surprised for the room - everything is brand new, super comfy bed. Was expecting less for the asking price.

And again, looking to the sunrise with this view with a cup of coffee - priceless!","Awesome!

I came to this place during my visit to Ubud. Tegallalang is an Unesco heritage site. This cute Case Sawah offers you the view of it 24/7. It’s amazing. Tegallalang wakes up at 10 am …. It rests at 5pm. And that’s what makes staying here magical. You witness the hussle and bussle during the day and the absolute silence at night. You’ll hear crickets and frogs. The view from here is absolutely breathtaking. The rooms are cute and clean. The staff so friendly. Buy yourself a bottle of wine and enjoy the view!"

We’re happy that our guide recommended us to be here after the rice paddy visit which was only 5 mins away. You can still enjoy the rice paddy view from this restaurant. There’re also western foods but we recommend mixed satay and chicken curry. Watermelon juice was made from real fruit and no sugar added (when you tell them). There’s also a swing that you can make photos with free of charge. Staff are helpful and toilet is clean.,"We had lunch at Carik Terrace Warung in late March. We wanted to dine somewhere on the more traditional side (as opposed to a Day Club) with views of the Rice Terraces - this place ticked those boxes for us.

The views were uninterrupted, hopefully my pictures do it justice! Only thing that spoiled a perfect view and atmosphere was the Zipline/suspended bike that was going back and forth across the Terraces.

Food was pretty good, we ate Mee Goreng, Nasi Goreng and shared a pineapple juice. The total was under 200k. The service probably could have been a bit better but we really went for the views so were happy that.

There is a toilet onsite which was clean and well stocked.","Good restaurant with great view, but maybe not so easy to park if you come with cars.
You can go to rice fields tracking from the restaurant.","Food is delicious, price is affordable, can expect if u eat and drink ",Very nice food plus a great view of the rice terrace. Service was good apart from giving my wife chips instead of rice but this was soon rectified by giving us the rice too so no complaints. I recommend the nasi campur.

This place has fewer swings as compared to other players in the same area, but the price is reasonable and not quite crowded too.",Had the duck & it was delicious but a little pricey for what it’s worth. View was nice but you can get the same view from any of the restaurants along the way. Staff wasn’t as happy as we experienced in Uluwatu. Drinks were very good.,I didnt order main courses here so i couldnt comment on that. But i ordered the dragon mango lazzy and apple ginger juice and it taste sooo good. I also order pisang goreng keju which was also delicious. And to add to that the view from the restaurant is amazing.,"The best happy hour coctail...
The balinese food is very testy, good view, frienly staff, the best swing."
