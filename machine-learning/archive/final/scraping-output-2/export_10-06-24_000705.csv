Definitely one of the must to go places in Bali.,"It's a nice place where you can experience Luwak coffee and be welcomed with a small tour of the production stages. Its natural pool and hanging iron bridge create a beautiful atmosphere. However, my only bad criticism is; The animals in this and all similar places are locked in small cages or neutralized with sedatives for display. This use of animals in general destroyed my interest in this coffee in general and this was the last time I drank it…",I just went in to taste Lowak coffee. Staff was friendly and showed me their civets and coffee making process. The have different options for tasting their tea and coffees. You can buy their products in the shop.

However, the area can get crowded with tourists, diminishing the tranquility. Overall, a must-visit for its natural beauty, but be prepared for the crowds.","📍🌸

A rice terrace, hidden and serene, 🌾🌟
Not too touristy, a tranquil scene. 🚶‍♂️🌟

Nice to walk around, soak in the view, 🚶‍♀️🌄
Surrounded by streets full of rattan, wood, crafts anew. 🏞️🎋

📍🌸","Overall the view is nice but you get the see the rice terrace along the stretch of cafes available. Most of them are extortionists due to the price.

This place was also expensive but we paid anyway because we needed some activity to feel like we made the most out of the day.

We had to pay 50k entrance (2pax) just to go into the area. They prefer cash over card. Using card would have incurred additional 3% fees, they said

Then another 700k for the zip line across the rice terrace. It was an experience but also honestly the excitement from the zip line would probably take away the excitement of the view. The view can be appreciated peacefully.

Their safety harness is smelly and dirty. No sanitation so if that is your biggest pet peeve, then the activity is not for you. No hair net whatsoever for the helmet. It stinks even after you remove it. There is also a weight/size limit on the activities like tandem bike, superman swing etc. the Harness need to fit before you can pay for the activity. Overall, it’s very touristy. Like drivers literally bring their passengers there as one of the pit stop.

We came from tis cafe so we walked and then walked back to tis cafe to enjoy the view!","For me the best rice terraces in Tegalalang. You just have to hang on and not go to the first two very exposed places and get here. Although you can also find typical tourist attractions like swings and hanging railways, there are far fewer people here 👍"

It overlooks the valley above the rice terraces and has a delightful ambience. They also have swings and although we had already done the swing, I thought this place was nicer. It was less crowded and offered similarly beautiful views. They also have a swimming pool for those interested in taking a dip.",We had a wonderful wedding anniversary lunch here with cocktails and the food was great (duck) as was the service. Our waitress asked if we were celebrating a special occassion and was kind enough to bring out a small dessert acknowleging our anniversary. The views are amazing! We didn't use the pool but some guests did take advantage of that perk.,"The food was pretty good, nothing special.
The views are phenomenal 😍. English is jot very well spoken by the staff, so it is preferable to use a translation app. Other than that, everything was super ! Definitely would give them a second visit in the future.","A Disappointing Encounter at d’Alas Warung Amidst Beautiful Surroundings

Our excursion around the island led us to d’Alas Warung, a restaurant set against a backdrop of stunning vistas and the unique allure of giant swings. Yet, the enchanting environment was sharply contrasted by the chaos that greeted us upon arrival. The restaurant was far from bustling, yet the staff seemed overwhelmed, leading to a series of service missteps that began with being directed to a dirty table and continued with a lack of attention from the staff, reminiscent of absent-minded NPCs in a game.

After repeated efforts to gain service, we opted for simplicity in our order, hoping to avoid further complications. We chose the pizza Margherita and French fries for the children, Karins Style Chicken, and I selected the Lumpia. The pizzas were merely passable, not warranting a recommendation. The Lumpia, however, provided a solitary high point with its satisfying crispness and flavor. Regrettably, the Karins Style Chicken was a letdown; even the children rejected it, suggesting it was an overcooked relic rather than a meal.

Our drinks were a mixed bag; the margaritas, although visually appealing, failed to deliver on taste. In contrast, the orange juice and young coconut were fresh and enjoyable.

While the prices did not break the bank, the overall culinary experience left much to be desired. More than the food, it was the apparent disarray among the staff that marred our experience the most. The beautiful location of d’Alas Warung deserves a service level to match, and hopefully, this was just an off day that is not indicative of the usual standard."

Taste the sides and mix all the ones you like in with the rice. The accompanying soup was delicious! We went during midday when it was clear so there was a great view of the nearby rice terrace (although other restaurants had a better view, after rice terrace hiking, I had enough of the rice terrace anyway).",You pay more for the demonstration of dishes than food itself. The rice terrace is hidden after coconut trees. The environment is great for eating.,Found a ant in my ice tea and some plastic. Their was a bug butterfly in the kitchen and the service was really long. The restaurant is not very clean and what about the koi pound.,"Amazing place, great view, nice staff and delicious food."
