Music was gentle and the perfect volume. Service was excellent, attentive and polite. The manager in particular was very professional and a charming hostess. The food was ok. Everything was nicely presented and fresh. But the menu and the flavours are generic pan-western. Nothing was bad, but nothing was wow or stood out.","I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough! Our dining experience was truly one-of-a-kind. The food? A perfect 10 out of 10, each dish bursting with flavor and creativity. The service team is exceptional, with Mary and Sophia leading the charge. They made sure every moment of our evening was memorable, ensuring we were always looked after with care and warmth.

The ambiance of the restaurant is like stepping into a luxurious cigar lounge mixed with the allure of a sexy date night spot. It's a combination that's hard to find elsewhere.

We loved every minute of our time here and would not hesitate to travel all the way from Canada just to dine here again. Love, love, love this place!","Visited Donna restaurant at my recent visit to UBUD, Bali. The place has a warm environment and a quite diverse menu. Food was simply fantastic, super delicious and well presented. The desserts were another great surprise, very well served and delicious. Special thanks to the restaurant manager Mr. Fabio who did his best to make us feel like at home. Definitely will visit this restaurant again.","Donna Restaurant is a culinary gem nestled in the heart of Ubud City Center. From the moment you step inside, you're greeted with warmth and elegance. The ambiance is chic yet inviting, perfect for a romantic dinner or a gathering with friends.
Now, let's talk about the food. Each dish at Donna is a masterpiece, expertly crafted with the finest ingredients and bursting with flavor. From their appetizers to their desserts, every bite is a delightful journey for the taste buds. I highly recommend trying their signature T-Bone steak, Even Peter Luger in New York can‚Äôt Compare, it's a true standout.
But what truly sets Donna apart is the impeccable service. The staff goes above and beyond to ensure a memorable dining experience, catering to every need with a smile.
Whether you're a seasoned foodie or simply looking for an unforgettable dining experience, Donna Restaurant in Ubud Bali is a must-visit. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.","A great place to go with a big group! Beautiful ambience that makes you feel like you‚Äôre in a treehouse. We really enjoyed the unique cocktails and their presentation. We shared some appetizers and each got a main dish, which were pretty substantial for one person. Beef tartare and grilled barramundi are a must!"

So many loungers around a beautiful pool with a sandy beach vibe with NO minimum spend. DJ playing all day and the food is incredible.

Service was top notch and the meals were just delicious.
We had salmon poke bowl, rosti and smoothie bowl- all will order again!
Thank you","10/10 place. A very popular spot in Ubud and a must visit. The food is amazing, healthy, fresh and their smoothies are crazy thick. In a good way. Their sushi kind of tacos is also a recommendation. So far I‚Äôve tried most of the smoothie bowls, had too many Cacaos and still room for A salted Caramel Taro bomb once in a while. The wifi is above average and it‚Äôs a good place to get to know people or get company. They also collaborate with artists and showcase their art with a few months in between. Personally I love that concept. Supporting artists.
Interior is super fine to.
One of the best places in Ubud.","Maybe Good for Many People, But Unfortunately Not for Me

I am Balinese and I got recommendation to visit this place from my foreigner friends. This cafe serves mostly organic and healthy food. I ordered Agni Chicken Curry and I've never tried that kind of curry before. The taste was not so-curry, less spices, and the rice was very dry (but I realized that I'm in the organic cafe, and I think this is what you got if you combine curry and organic concept). My partner ordered Crabby Pad Thai because she loved seafood and unfortunately she got stomachache just after we arrived at home. We predicted it was because the crab wasn't so fresh, idk. Beside that, the tea was very good and we liked their concept of serving the tea. For the ambience, it was very ""Ubud"". Their concept and architecture were unique (full of bamboo). There was a DJ played music and a lot of people danced. Because of that, I think this cafe is not suitable for those who want to work from cafe. 5 stars for ambience and concept, but 2 stars for dishes. Thank you",Very cute and trendy spot. The food was really good! I ordered the seaweed tacos and my boyfriend the ‚Äò15 minute smoothie bowl‚Äô. Their kombucha is also very nice. There was live music. Overall 10/10.

French toast: absolutely delicious - and I am picky about french toasts. Sadly it does not come with fruits, so I had to add a plate on top.
Banana pancake: fluffy and well presented. They use whole-wheat flour, which I did not particularly like.
Loved the cream that comes with both of them.
Solid bacon and a good fruit plate (although the mango did not taste at all).
The drinks are good.
Good ambience and friendly and attentive staff.",We came for dinner. Elsa took care of us and she is absolutely amazing. Food and drinks were on point. Rais was delightful too. We truly enjoyed our time here and will come back again.,"Best restaurant experience I had in Ubud and I went to zest and some other recommended places. I experienced it during the day and for dinner and left very satisfied. I got the falafel wrap, aperol spritz, and espresso martini. Best espresso martini I have had in Bali. Then I ended up returning for dinner and honestly this place should be more packed. Comfy seats, great service, amazing food, delicious cocktails! I got the house salad,  fettuccine & a sangria.

Great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","We had dinner at Watercress cafe tonight and the food was absolutely delicious.

We didn‚Äôt used the pool to relax as we had some outdoor plans but it seems nice to rest! We stayed for 2 days 2 nights and the room is very big with enough space.  Breakfast was nice and we had a nice table beside the pool.

Our room was at the back so we had no problem  at night due to the on going live music at the hotel restaurant, the bar next door or the big clubs around.","The staff was very friendly and helpful, so I hate having to write a negative review and advising you to stay elsewhere. Lavish property, mostly well designed, yet crippled by terrible choices. Loud live music plays in the lobby restaurant to midnight - you can forget about sleeping or even relaxing in your room. Even when the hotel stops playing music, the bars next door keep loud music going until 1 or 2am. There is simply no quiet at this hotel. Forget about sleeping in, because the rooms don‚Äôt have proper blackout blinds.

The breakfast buffet is extremely basic (cereal, bread, fruit), with a good accompanying menu of hot items - but they only let you get one single item off that menu. It‚Äôs a very expensive hotel; they shouldn‚Äôt be counting my breakfast bagels or scoops of rice! The wifi is slow and cuts in and out, and the air conditioning struggles to keep up with Bali‚Äôs weather. It can‚Äôt maintain comfortable temperatures until late evening. You can control it - to a point - but the system is temperature-limited so you can‚Äôt just leave it running; it will turn itself off once it decides the room is cold enough, and you can‚Äôt force it to go any colder, you just have to wait until the system decides it‚Äôs warm enough in the room to come back on. At full power the room never became a comfortable temperature; I had to go into the grocery store and pharmacy to feel comfortable. So even though the staff was fantastic, I just can‚Äôt recommend the hotel because it was an expensive, large beautiful room with non stop light, noise and heat.","The location of the hotel is very strategic near the center of Ubud, where all activities go. The room is big enough and clean. There are three restaurants at the hotel that can spoil our holiday.  The breakfast was also very good.  At 4 pm we can also enjoy tea time, where we can choose coffee or tea accompanied by snacks. The breakfast is great and rich.","Had a fantastic time staying at this hotel. The room was better than expected, location is perfect - walking distance to everything. Staff are friendly and helpful and the restaurants are great - especially Pasir great food and cocktails!","We stayed here for four nights and we had a great time in Ubud as the hotel is near in some famous temples, Ubud Market, Monkey Forest, shops, and restaurants.

Service was excellent! Breakfast was delicious. Rooms were cleaned every day.

I will definitely recommend this hotel if you want to explore the center of the ‚ÄúIsland of the Gods‚Äù."

The service is great from the restaurant to the pool team.
Thank you for making our stay a memorable one. We will surely come back","I stayed at Komaneka at Bisma in February, and I was so thankful of the experience.
Not only the resort itself was absolutely amazing with its jungle-like views and fancy rooms, but also the staffs were so caring and amazing. I suffered so much from denghi fever during my stay here, and the staffs did everything they could to make my stay as comfortable as possible. I was also deeply touched on my last day at the resort when they all wrote me a card wishing me recovery, and handed me some fruits. Although I could not enjoy the resort as much as I wanted due to my illness, the warmth the staffs gave me made my stay memorable. Thank you. I will definitely recommend this place.","This was by far the best hotel I‚Äôve ever been to. We were somewhat reluctant when booking this place because the price is quite high. But it was completely and absolutely worth it - this place is heaven on earth üíöThere is no suggestion or improvement I can make as everything was simply perfect. The rooms, the breakfast, the view, the outside area, the amenities, the staff - everything exceeded our expectations in every possible way.
Small gestures like offering afternoon tea with a variety of food options, supplying after-sun lotion near the poolside bar, providing freshly baked biscuits in your room, and placing a bedtime story about Balinese culture on your bedside table are the kind of thoughtful details you can expect from the staff at Komaneka at Bisma.
If you‚Äôre indecisive about staying in this place, go for it because you‚Äôll not regret it. Reviews will never do it justice.","Serene and peaceful environment with very friendly and helpful staffs! Special mention on their attention to detail to guests - top notch and better than many well-known, big brand hotel groups. Made us feel welcomed from the very beginning and relaxed through the stay. Free yoga session offered every morning is great. Highly recommended in every way!","Very beautiful hotel, located close to the centre of Ubud, but situated on a quiet spot between rice field and lush jungle with beautiful views from both the rooms, restaurant and pool area. Very friendly staff makes your stay as comfortable as possible, providing great service from check-in till checkout. You notice the quality of this hotel in many little details. Staff really connects to their customers, remembering your name and (in our case) noticing that someone of our family was missing at breakfast (one of our kids not feeling well) and asked several times about his well-being and provided all kinds of help throughout the day to make him feel better. I haven't seen this kind of personal service in a hotel very often. Definitely would suggest a stay at Komaneka at Bisma!"

Thanks again Hendra.","Great find on our first night at Ubud- great atmosphere and drinks by the pool. Hendra, our waiter, was amazing- very funny, super attentive and naturally hospitable! Plus he makes the best cocktails. Definitely coming back","We booked a day bed at 250,000 IDR, and were so excited for the movie night. Arrived around 5pm and was directed to a day bed that was positioned at an awkward position. Requested to the crew if we can move to an empty day bed that was nearer to the screening but was told it was reserved. Hence, there is no first come first serve policy although we came early and make a rather advance booking - weeks before our trip to Ubud.

Food tasted okay, portion not huge, and relatively expensive considering we already paid for the day bed.

For the day bed there is also different type of roofing. Some of the day beds has bigger roofing while some has smaller roofing. Since we were assigned the smaller roofing, we were drenched under the moderate rain half-way through the movie.

Overall, the experience was okay, but it did not meet our expectation considering the price paid."

And let's not forget the pool! A wonderful infinity pool merging with the jungle view, it was the perfect place to relax after a day of adventures. Bisma Eight truly combines luxury with Balinese charm, and the yoga classes were a great bonus for unwinding. I can't recommend it enough!","After visiting Bisma Eight to dine at the Copper Kitchen on the rooftop last year, we returned to stay in the hotel. I love the style of this place.

Popcorn chicken with mayo: Crispy fried chicken served with wasabi mayo dipping sauce‚Äîso tasty and finger-licking good!

Truffle Parmesan fries: Hand-cut fries deep-fried in truffle oil, topped with herbs and Parmesan cheese.

For drinks, we enjoyed the happy hour offerings:

Lychee Rosa: A refreshing and tasty mix of white rum, lychee, cranberry, and lemon.

Moscow Mule: Vodka, homemade ginger beer, and lime juice made for a delicious, refreshing drink.

The venue offers various seating options and TVs showing sports (we saw some locals catching up on the footy, which made us smile). There's also a club and dance floor at the back of the bar door for evenings.

Overall, we highly recommend The Blue Door for its exceptional service, great food, and inviting atmosphere. We'll definitely be back!

Breakfast at The Blue Door in Ubud is a must-try! They were incredibly accommodating, especially since we were traveling with children. They made minor changes to our orders, omitting certain ingredients as needed and serving the kids' meals separately so we could remove any unwanted items.

The eggs were cooked to perfection, and the juices and smoothies were fresh, flavorful, and refreshing. A fantastic way to start the day! Highly recommended for families and anyone looking for a great breakfast spot in Ubud!

No high chair for bubs, but we were able to compromise a chair and cushion to prop her up to see and eat. Very cute.","Having come from England, we wanted some form of tradition to our Christmas whilst being away. We came for the 3 course set menu on Christmas Day and we absolutely loved it! All of the staff were so welcoming and friendly and the food and presentation were outstanding! The atmosphere was great with the live music! The christmas crackers were a nice touch too. We enjoyed it so much, we even came back for dinner the next day (and to watch the football). Thank you for making our Christmas :)","Stopped in for lunch and liked it so much went back for an afternoon drink that turned into dinner. Suan our waiter was absolutely brilliant, happy and helpful above and beyond. Great music and the food was excellent.","Great pub! But some disappointing menu availability.

So we came and watched a football game here, ended up enjoying the live music and food too. The drinks were good. The live music too. But we were told the menu wasnt fully available since the kitchen was too busy so we couldnt get the pizza and other mains they had, only finger food was available. However, we were seeing pizzas going to a lot of other tables. When requested again, they said the other tables had reserved, but that should not matter - if the kitchen can do pizzas, then they can do it for everyone.

Honestly the finger food was average. We got the truffle fries, wings, croquettes, corndogs, dumplings and sliders. Best was the sliders and truffle fries. Corndog and wings were disappointing.","My last evening in Bali & for this I picked this place to sat goodbye to my 1 week short trip to this beautiful island and I was not disappointed. I am glad I am leaving Bali on a good note and blue door restaurant was really great. I had 2 drinks (Vodka & Taquilla) with Grilled Chicken, Calamari, Nachos. Both drinks & Food was good and the vibes as well as the music üé∂ just made it and my overall experience even better. I spent around 2 hours over there. I wish I could have spent more but I had a morning flight to catch so I left after 2 hours. It was all in one place & I would recommend everyone to visit this place if you are in Ubud and looking for good food drinks & live music."

The reviews for this property were outstanding and helped in our decision making of where to book in Ubud. We were blown away from the outset at this amazing sanctuary - it‚Äôs a hidden gem offering total serenity and yet only metres away from the bustling streets of Ubud. The resort is beguiling and is surrounded by lush greenery. The restaurant offers a very tasty menu. I must rave over the staff.  Every single staff member we encountered  during our stay greeted us with a dazzling smile and extreme courtesy. Nothing is too much trouble for them - it‚Äôs difficult to leave a place where you feel so welcomed. We look forward to returning next year and bringing more family members along with us. Thank you for making our stay a beautiful one!,"From the moment you get off the busy street of Ubud you enter into a tranquil oasis called Komaneka at Rasa Sayang.  The front desk team was welcoming and friendly.  This hotel is in the heart of Ubud but it feels you are in a beautiful secluded jungle away from it all.  The pool area is absolutely gorgeous and a relaxing place to spend some time.  The room was very spacious with lots of different seating options.  The bed was firm and super comfortable. The decor of the room felt like Balinese meets mid century modern.  The afternoon tea offering was wonderful.  The staff at the tea time/breakfast was so kind.  The only small drawback is for those who love to exercise like me, There is no gym. When I‚Äôm back in Ubud I will definitely stay here again.","Excellent location - just in the middle of the best street for dining and shopping, but very quiet. Staff was very attentive, breakfast was good (not too many options, but everything I wanted/needed), nice swimming pool with sunny and shady areas. The rooms are clean, spacious and well appointed. Beware of monkeys which can get in if you leave balcony doors open.","Komaneka is our home away from home in Bali. My partner and I stayed previously and returned this time with our friends who were also blown away. The location is perfect, walking distance to everything, and it is clean, spacious and comfortable. The pool and air conditioning are outstanding and the breakfast and afternoon tea are delicious. What is most exceptional here are the staff- they are so helpful, nothing is too much and give a very personalised service. I was unfortunately unwell towards the end of our stay and they allowed us to rest in the room a little longer as we had a late flight and took such great care of us. They are incredible and deserve a pay rise!! We love it here and recommend it most highly. Lots of love Mr Matt and Miss Katy :)","This hotel is a hidden jewel in the busy streets of Ubud and is truly in a class of its own.
The atmosphere in the hotel is amazing, the surroundings are beautiful, the planting in the atrium gardens is incredibly beautiful and everything perfectly maintained.
The staff are smiling, welcoming, and helpful in every respect. You almost feel like you become a part of a big family from the moment you check in

Do I need to mention that the kitchen is also in a class of its own.

We stayed at the hotel for 4 days in March 2024. We can only give our best recommendations to Komaneka at Rasa Sayang.
It is absolutely certain that we will come again."

I went there for the first time last Saturday and I was blown away by the caliber of the musicians who were there that night.  I was amazed how they could pack so much musical talent on such a small stage but the 6 members of the band made it work.  On Saturday evening the band was called Legends of Blues.  I am told there is a different band every night and they are all equally talented.  I also found the food and service to be excellent.  Recommended for an entertaining night out in downtown Ubud,"Another fun night at the Buddha. Never a bad one. Excellent music, friendly staff, decent food and drink and most of all a great atmosphere. Everyone enjoys themselves here. Nobody has to be cool. Cool Tones did a great job tonight but there‚Äôs music every night. Check out their socials to see what‚Äôs on. You can‚Äôt go wrong here.","We had a wonderful time at this restaurant. The live band was excellent, and both the food and drinks were good. The ambiance added to the experience. We highly recommend visiting.","""Dining at Laughing Buddha was an absolute delight! From the moment we walked in, the top-notch service set the tone for a memorable evening. The ambiance was enhanced by the awesome live band, creating a lively and enjoyable atmosphere. As for the cuisine, the Chinese dishes were simply exceptional. Each dish burst with authentic flavors and freshness, showcasing the skill and dedication of the chefs. Standouts included the fragrant stir-fried noodles and the perfectly crispy spring rolls. Overall, Laughing Buddha offers a truly memorable dining experience, combining excellent service, fantastic music, and delicious Chinese cuisine.""","There is live music every evening between 8 and 11. If you want, you can sit at shared tables and mingle with other people. Or you can sit separately. A different group appears every day.

Card accepted","Absolutely loved Cafe Wayan! This restaurant was our favourite in Ubud and we went there 3 times in 6 days. Food was delicious, good price, fantastic setting, and superb service. We had been recommended the place by a local and we were so happy we went! Would really recommend. Thank you!","Recommended by the local guy, 3 of us came in last minute around 10.15pm for dinner. Was told kitchen was closing at 10.30pm and we could dine until 11pm.
But when placing order, I felt some tension and stress that we were hurried and preferably order something simple and easy to cook. I also gave up the intention of having a bottle of wine so I went for just plain water instead. While eating our meal the guy told us that we could stay till as late as we could. Only if he told us earlier I would have ordered the bottle of wine. That‚Äôs no big deal but it‚Äôs communication and service that can be improved on.
The dishes turned out very delicious and on high quality. The settings charming and inviting.
We had the Beef Rendang which was one of the best we have tasted in Bali, many other places were let-downs, and it‚Äôs not as sweet as Malaysian or Singaporean style, it is on the savoury side. (Not like someone mentioned on previous review!) The Seafood Nasi Goreng was perfectly cooked with generous amount of seafood pieces, well balanced taste and had wok flavour. All served with acar and sambal terasi.
Prices are slightly higher but well worth it.
Definitely will return and recommend this place.
Will come early next time.","This is a long standing and very good wurang style restaurant along Jl. Monkey Forest in central Ubud. We had a couple great meals here during our last visit to Ubud over a decade ago and was glad to find them still open and faithfully serving excellent Balinese and Indonesian dishes in their charming garden setting area.

Opening hours are 10am to 11pm. They have many tables so walk-in is usually not a problem but if you want to ensure specific romantic seating in the garden, best to reserve in advance.

We had two meals here again during our recent visit to Ubud. They were both great. One meal was a more casual lunch where we enjoyed the Beef Randang, a generous serving of nicely stewed beef, a bit on the sweet side compared to the hotter and spicier versions you might have tried elsewhere in Indonesia or Malaysia. The Nasi Campur (vegetarian style) was better than we expected and tasted very good as well, a nice combination of veg ingredients, sambal and rice. Very flavourful and worth reordering.

Most impressive however was a separate dinner at Cafe Wayan where we tried their Smoked Duck for 2 - a signature heritage dish which is best to call in advance and preorder. This was a huge and sensational serving, think succulent dark duck packed with local spices and wrapped in betelnut leaf before being slowly smoked to perfection. Aroma was amazing, flavours intense and absolutely delicious, probably the best individual food item we have tried so far this year.  Starter of chicken soup, sides and satay were also very good. This was a feast of great food, leaving us with really full bellies and big smiles on our face.

Will eagerly return to Ubud the next time we are in Bali and specifically reserve table in back to again enjoy the Smoked Duck in the intimate garden setting at Cafe Wayan. This was just a fabulous meal.",An older establishment serving traditional Balinese cuisine. The patio is very tropical and beautiful. The service was excellent. The food was descent but surprisingly bland. Even the sambal was lacking in flavor. The decor and restrooms needed some updating. Overall a pleasant experience at this long time Balinese establishment.

The pertiwi spa went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.,"I was wondering whether to leave this review, because the staff is lovely and really tried, and a friend recommended the hotel to me. So maybe I just had bad luck. But I‚Äôm sharing because I think it‚Äôs important.

Okay, for the positives, the hotel is charming, has lots of greenery, two pools. You can really feel connected to nature. It‚Äôs beautiful.

But moving on. First, the hotel is under renovation. I had construction right opposite me, so I was woken up by noise in the morning, and at the main pool, where it was absolutely impossible to relax, because the renovating guys were playing loud music in addition to the construction noises.

Furthermore, although the rooms themselves are large, airy, nicely decorated, especially since I got an upgrade at check-in. Well equipped, hard to fault. But! The first room I stayed in I had to leave in the middle of the night because the whole floor was covered in ants, and there was probably a bird living under the roof, so I heard it as if it was in the room itself.
In the next room, there were almost no ants, but instead there were other large bugs in the bathroom. I killed them myself or asked the staff to do it. To get rid of them, the staff sprayed the bathroom and room with a strong chemical, which made it completely impossible for me to sleep, the smell was so suffocating. So despite trying, I decided to move out early. The staff was nice enough to edit my reservation.
After moving out, I only then realized how all my clothes smelled of those chemicals and I had to send everything to the laundry.
Furthermore - the food. Very modest and mediocre. The fruit was unripe, the bread was all in flies and gnats. Pancakes and Balinese coffee saved me.
So honestly - I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel and I moved to another with relief.","Being our first stop over in Bali, we weren't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised by the location. It isn't too far from Central Ubud. There is a convenience store very close by. Staff were absolutely lovely. Always smiling and pleasant. Housekeeping did an amazing job. Rooms were always clean.
The grounds are beautifully laid out. Gardens, all really well looked after. Has 2 swimming pools, one overlooking the forest. It is a very tranquil setting, indeed.
Rooms could do with some updating, but I believe they are doing that as I write this.
Breakfast was really nice.
We really enjoyed our stay here."

The room was today, the pool was clean, and the facilities were tidy. So far the hostel has been quiet, but a roomie told me there was a massive party when they arrived which went until 3am. Not necessarily a bad thing, just something to be aware of.
The hostel is located well and a short distance from a lot of sights.
I recommend this hostel.","Stayed here for 4 nights while exploring Ubud and surrounding areas. The location is excellent, the rooms are okay and the bathrooms are of decent size. The toilet in our dorm was blocked from the moment I checked in so it was essentially unusable and had to go to the breakfast area toilets to use those.
The beds have their own sockets and light and they come with curtains for more privacy. The rooms/beds themselves are very noise prone. My mattress was so old that the hole in the middle of the mattress you felt the wood through that the mattress is placed upon.

They have options for using towels and changing them daily if you want and the pool is a nice area to hang out at. Rooms have good functioning air conditioning and lockers for each bed.
Overall a good experience, but they definitely have some things to improve. 4 stars instead of 3 because of the location and service of staff.","This place isn‚Äôt great but isn‚Äôt bad, nice pool and chill area for the price. You get a banana pancake and tea/coffee included (average) for breakfast, my room was 6 man, cramped and tiny, very dark in there, no light in your bed, and most of all, the beds were unbelievably squeaky and shaky. Basically if you want comfort I suggest a private room or somewhere else!","The hostel was nice, really good pool and clean but the WiFi was honestly so bad and there‚Äôs like 8 of them but they barley work. Should really look at getting the wifi sorted and also should put shelves and lamps in each bed.","Everything was great! I stayed in the private room facing the pool and it was amazing! You have lots of space and spacious bathroom. I also stayed in a 6 bed dorm 2 nights and was fine, not much room for backpack and personal stuff. Breakfast is good and you can get extra fruit for 10k. It is in the center, you can walk to many restaurants and main streets. The staff was nice.

The coffee (latte, double shot, daily milk) was fantastic.","Recently stayed in Ubud for a few days and visited several coffee shops including Ubud Coffee Roastery along Jalan Goutama Selatan.

Had mixed feelings about this place. Enjoyed the nice setup, comfortable environs and friendly service but didn't like the coffee served at all.

Seems like a fairly standard operation and coffee preparation. Unfortunately, espresso may have been over-roasted. It was really sour with a bad burnt taste, just hard to drink straight without quite a bit of sugar. Piccolo was more drinkable but still not a very good coffee drink.

Maybe just a bad day to visit Ubud Coffee Roastery, we just didn't have the same luck as previous visitors.","One of the better filter coffees I've had in Ubud. I ordered the Java Ijen - Aerobic Natural, and it was an enjoyable cup. My partner opted for a cortado with oat milk milk and enjoyed it as it was made well, however the actual coffee used didn't have much going on. No choice of beans was offered for espresso based drinks. We both ordered a donut each and they were pretty good! It's a nice space with a good amount of seating. One area is open air and the other is inside with air-conditioning. When I order a v60/hand poured coffee, I like to have it served with a glass of water and some information about the coffee I've selected, but this unfortunately didn't happen here. The baristas and staff were all happy and friendly, but no one chatted to us about the coffee, which I would have liked considering this place is a coffee roaster. Overall, a decent place and I would return to explore more of the filter menu.","Excellent coffee - tasty and flavorful - just what you would expect from a specialty coffee shop. They serve 100% Indonesian arabica - like in most places.

I had the Americano with oatmilk (40K) and it was so good.

They have two seating areas - indoor with air con (my favorite) and outdoor terrace.

Went in the afternoon at 2.30pm and they must have run out of snacks or treats. Fine for me as I just wanted coffee.

If you are a coffee-holic or value great coffee, you‚Äôll love it.

Ps. Check out the very original door handle.

We had a fantastic experience!
We had the long menu, it says 7 courses but we counted 14 delicious dishes.
The recipes are original, meticulously crafted, using fresh, seasonal and local ingredients. We were happy to discover new flavors!
Vegans and non vegans loved the flavors and textures. What a treat and a feast for the eyes as well!
We were impressed by the mocktails, as well as the whole tea experience, which is worth a try.
Service was attentive without being over the top, friendly and professional.
Definitely a must try if you‚Äôre in Ubud.","When a dish is well-executed, it evokes emotion. Vegetarian cuisine is particularly challenging because it requires a great deal of creativity to compensate for the absence of animal products in sauces (the DNA of a dish): a true challenge. Tonight, accompanied by our 8-year-old daughter, we were delighted. Each dish we tasted evoked emotion. The presentation of the plates was meticulous, and each dish (with very little wait between courses) was extremely well-crafted and thoughtful. The beverages paired with each dish were also excellently chosen and added something special to each course. There's a lot of sensitivity that emanates from this cuisine. I love meat and fish, but tonight, I didn't miss them at all. Of course, all of this comes at a price, but considering the effort and research behind each dish, it seems entirely justified to me. Bravo, we will definitely be back!","What a beautiful restaurant! Hidden away in the Ubud city we found it by walking past and it was already shut for the day so we came back the next day!

It‚Äôs a plant based degustation and I was so amazed by how delicate and detailed all the dishes were made.

Every dish was amazing and I wish if I had a restaurant like this in my country!

Kids will like with the free drinks and fruits that included in the room rate,"I really enjoyed my stay at Adiwana Monkey Forest. It was among one of the smallest hotels we stayed at in Bali, but Adiwana made up for that with great service and lots of Bali charm.

Some highlights for me were the pool at night, swirling around under the trees, and the daily activities, demonstrations, etc. offered by the Adiwana staff. During my stay, I was able to make and learn more about the Balinese offerings as well as help make and then eat some green Balinese Pancakes. These demos weren't highlighted outside of the smallest little notice on the bar, so ask the staff if you're interested.

A slight discomfort was the shower in the room. It didn't have enough clearance for water, so it did seep through the door and into the rest of the room. Upon noticing, we were able to avoid further flooding by turning the water off and on. Secondly, breakfast needed to be ordered the night before (who knows what one is craving the next day?!).

All in all, Adiwana offered us a really nice stay! Would recommend!","Had a fantastic stay here. The hotel is beautiful, the staff incredibly warm and welcoming and the room was spotless and very comfortable. Really great location to walk around Ubud too. Great value.","Amazing property (while being small) at a very good location. Very clean and pleasant.
Very good levels of hospitality. Special shout out to Ms Rathna for a very warm welcome and making our stay pleasurable. Thank you Mr Putr & team for great cocktails and mocktails. Amazing breakfast by chef and team. To top it up with great juices and coffee by Ms Made.
The front office executive Mr Putu needs a serious refresher/ training in hotel management or hospitality. For every question/ request, Mr Putu will always start with no as an answer (Very unlikely of all other staff being present there and helping always with a warm smile).
Overall, highly recommend this property.","The staff is very friendly and sincere. We had a very warm welcome ceremony during the checkin. The location is very close monkey forest and is right in the city center, at the same time, keeping its serenity. The room was equipped with everything needed. Comfy bed, over expectations service, we loved it totally .. will surely come again when in Ubud."
