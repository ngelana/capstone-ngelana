Must visit
The taste is ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The price is quite cheap
Super worth it!
Been here twice and will visit again and again!
Minus is only the place to eat is outdoor only so it's quite hot at afternoon and the parking lot is small 🙏","Love it, the texture of the noodles its nice i like it, mie yamin good, bakmie ayam good, mix bakso and pangsit kuah was good, kwetiaw was good.

The broth only lil bit to tasteless, i think if they put more salt and lil bit of sesame oil will be more good.
Price its so affordable.
Portion of the noodles good.

They have a new proper place now, in front of the mart.

They have 2 times to served 10am-2pm and 4pm-6pm ( if still available)
And try to come early so the acar timun and acar cabe rawit hijau still there.

But overall for the price and taste good noodles bar in Denpasar, this gonna be my favorite so far.","not worth the wait. service was slow, with a lot of orders and queue, they need to be fast enough to serve those many orders. food just ok, too salty and too sweet for me personally. I like Mie Bandung more than this bakmi. price is cheap, that's the only good thing about this place.",Ok,Sellers too slow. Taste just okay

We had 2 meals; one is rice with chicken, beef lungs, perkedel, the other is rice with beef lungs, beef skin. We also ordered iced tea and orange.

The food was totally not worth the price tag of IDR 125K. Not to mention the portion was barely filling. I've had much better nasi padang for cheaper.

Will never come back here even if it's the last palce to eat on earth.","Here, you can buy a portion only for food and choose what you like. Affordable price & delicious especially the Rendang","I came 21.38 during ramadhan,expecting to have a big meal after fasting. But only received half portion of rice, so are my wife and kids. When i asked for some more rice,he said it is out, habis. So i only had 1/2 portion. Then when we need to pay in the end, all meals were charged as full portion. Such a rip off warung padang. I know its pricy to eat there but i just didnt expect them to charge unequally. Surely will never come back,thanks for lessons..","Love the food, people are so nice, mashallah 🙏🙏🙏"
