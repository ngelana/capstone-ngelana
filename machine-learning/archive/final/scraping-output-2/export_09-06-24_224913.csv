We are in the middle of the ricefield!
The room is comfortable, the style is great, and the view is just Bali that i know long time before ‚ò∫Ô∏è
The team is young and very ‚Äúguest oriented‚Äù  big thumb üëç
Breakfast was amazing, there are buffet of nasi&bami goreng, toast, and fresh fruit, coffee and tea on the table! And you can choose also 1 eggdish,  fresh juice ( real fresh and lots of fruit inside it üòç)   FOR this price level, this is beyond expectation. I don‚Äôt expect it before, because alot of older reviews gave low point for the breakfast. So, the owner has done something great and take the feedback seriously üëçüëç","Upon arrival a delicious welcome drink was handed to us by most gracious hosts.  They provided board games available to take to your room.  The grounds were beautiful surrounded by rice patties.  Each thoughtfully designed bungalow was a villa in itself, carved Balinese doors, lovely patio with comfortable furniture with multi-million dollar views.  Immaculately clean and cleaned daily.  The pool was refreshing and perfect temp. and super clean. The affordable Massages were also from highly trained therapists. .  From the owners to the entire staff, everyone was gracious and happy.  Food was awesome and the general high vibes carries out with detailed assistance in everything you might need to have a wonderful experience.  If you want the Bali you have been looking for, this is it!  I have  immensely enjoyed 2 stays and plan to return.",If you are wanting a pure experience of beautiful Bali in your dreams this is it. From the owners down to every staff member all needs were thoughtfully taken care of. Food was wonderful and very reasonably priced. Massage experience was PERFECT. Pool temp was perfect and clean Whole place was enchanting at night with magical lighting ambiance Views from patio gorgeous surrounded by rice paddies and mountain views and perfect sunsets. Voila!,"Surely the best place we have been during our stay in Bali.

The welcome is absolutely nice and heartwarming. The people there take a very good care of your, doing their best to fulfill your needs and demands.

The place itself is a small and cute cocoon open to the rice fields and the little village of Banyuatis. You can see kids playing around, talk to grandmothers weaving hats, have a walk around... The restaurant is very good, and if you thrive for western food, they have some good choices to quench your thirst!

You get a large choice of activities that goes from hiking around the village to snorkeling near Java or discovering the amazing waterfalls of Munduk. You can explain what you want to do and they will handle everything for you ! It is also possible to rent a scooter (cheaper than specialized shops).

Anyway, you can book a room blindfolded, there is no way you'll be disappointed!",It was the best accommodation I stayed in Bali. Wonderful scenery and friendly staff. Both the pouring stars and the quiet and beautiful village were the best. I highly recommend the spa that you can get outdoors in a private location. I'll definitely visit again.
