Food is very very good. Staff is very professional and attentive.
Perfect place for vacation and enjoy the beauty of the nature.","Amazing resort - from the luxurious suites to the great food to the variety of activities and the impeccable service - five stars all around. We loved having  Dewa, our butler, who took care of our every need. He was so thoughtful and responsive, always with a big smile.","the best hotel we‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of staying at. top notch staff and excellent food. the property itself is truly magical, earning that reserve name. villas were also one of the largest we‚Äôve ever stayed in, we could stay there for days without ever wanting to leave!","Causing troubles for me paying this time. I spent two entire days with booking spa treatments for us five people. First, this is the most expensive spa in Ubud we could have, 56 millions rupiah. But my family felt very cold during the spa but because they don‚Äôt speak English so the staff didn‚Äôt understand their needs. Second, I spent at least half a day on paying the deposit (I used one Australian bank card one British bank card however both failed, at last I did international bank transfer). Two bank cards were blocked due to many times trying. Bank transfer succeeded. The problem should be the payment link but they didn‚Äôt realized. It never happened to me before. The worst thing was before we leaving the reception, the staff asked me to pay again. International bank transfer takes time, but they are just so aggressive to see the money in account immediately, no matter how much troubles for the customers. It took us an hour for the payment, which made us anxious about our night flight. Managers didn‚Äôt want to help the staffs nor the guests. Big management crisis. Generally, I felt they have no trust on their customers, and they don‚Äôt care about customers‚Äô experience. The only thing they care about is making money. They waste our time to train their staffs (most of them can‚Äôt speak English well, nor skillfully swiping a card). Obviously they cut the recruit cost to make money however the cost of the guests raises up. The experience is terrible compared to nine years ago I stayed there last time. Don‚Äôt want to waste more time on review hopefully it provided real opinions.","Cannot say better things about this amazing luxury hotel! Location of Ubud along saying river help me to connect with nature while enjoy the luxury service the hotel has to offer.

The service is exceptional,attentive  truly experience of Balinese hospitality. From our butler to any server in any restaurant, any person we come across In the hotel knows our name. The excursion arranged by hotel is one of a kind and safe and personal. We have build so many memories on our excursion as a family.

I Want to say a personal thank you to our butler Marka. He went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable, he always think ahead to book us restaurant, buggy service etc. cannot recommend enough!"

Food was delicious as well, either breakfast, lunch, or dinner it‚Äôs all good.
Definitely will be back when visit Ubud.",A small coffee and a mixed juice priced at 300k reflects a complete lack of sensibility. Daylight robbery. No wonder it was empty.,"One of the first Aman facing the beautiful valley with beautiful and spacious rooms, some of them have private pools. The gym is well equipped.

The villa itself was lovely with lush decor and furnishings. The pool area was relaxing although the pool was a bit chilly. I love the whole outdoor bathroom facilities as it adds to the experience however as it was raining quite a bit when we were there, the bathroom floor was always covered in water and not just a little bit but a lot. Maybe matting or something similar would be a suggestion so as your not always paddling around in water going to the toilet and trying not to slip over. But in saying this it didn't make the stay a bad one. The location isn't close to the main street of Ubud but they offer a free shuttle service which takes about 10 to 15 minutes.

Good food, though expensive. Staff are phenomenal. The inner courtyard for dinner is fantastic, gorgeous and intimate with live music.

Wonderful experience with ensured good time, intermediate/beginners level can try.

Avoid the rainy season if trying for the 1st time as rapids will be too strong to handle (on the basis of locals in bali)

Ps : It was my 1st time rafting. Also we had to go down almost 400 steps to reach the river (starting points)","Totally loved the whole experience. Very well managed, this is a much loved activity of Ubud, Bali. Do not miss if you get a chance. The river is perfect with not so rush and the guides who take care of the raft are also well trained. The jungles of Bali will amaze you and make this unforgettable.","Great experience! Only downside is the long steps going down to the river. Not recommended if you have any movement disabilities.

This accommodation is not cheap and the location is so bad that you have to take their golf cart to get there.
I can accept these, but the first person ran out of hot water halfway through the shower. He told the counter that we had to wait for 20 minutes.

The funny is when we already waited about 40 minutes, the water was still cold, this is the worst place I have ever stayed in while traveling.

And the night security brings us to another room to take a shower, you know what? Still cold water

Really ridiculous!
So I pay the 250 USD per night then I take a shower with cold water?

The place we stayed a few days ago was half the price but this has never happened to us before.

This villa destroyed my vacation, I am coming to Bali for relaxing not looking for trouble.","First off let me start by saying Samkhya Villas is truly a hidden gem.

Summary:
+ the hospitality is on a whole other level compared to the hotels we've visited around the world
+ breakfast and any food orders are being delivered directly to your room with stunning views
+ if you can't make it for breakfast due to an early day trip, they will prepare a lunch box for you
+ their food and Spa is on a high competitive level
+ their smiles and willingness to help you from the receptionist to the driver is exceptional
+ they are so responsive on WhatsApp
+ since their location is not accessible via car, they offer their own electric small vehicle to transport you to the main road

- the wifi is quite poor, we were in room 9. Not sure how the other rooms were
- hot water was not always sufficient. It kind of stopped after a while
- on the roof of the bathroom, we could hear stuffs falling off the tree, which would wake us up a few times during the night (i guess that comes with being in the jungle?)

All in all i cannot stress and enough that everyone was EXTREMELY friendly. Reception, driver, cooks, waiters, spa staff, gardeners. Everyone.
I hope they can review our constructive critic and make their hotel better than it already is. Thanks for having us :)","My husband and I had a very very very pleasant stay in these villas. The rooms were nice, the airconditioning was working great, the bathrooms were clean and tidy every day. The swimming pool belonging to our villa was very nice. The food in the hotel‚Äôs restaurant was great!!!!! But the best of all is the friendliness of the staff. Honestly all of them were SO nice and helpful and kind and smiling every day. Breakfast in our room every day was not a problem and any wish we had we could text them and it could be done for us. Communication was very pleasant on WhatsApp. We had a really nice experience here üß°","We have stayed in other villas in Ubud and the experience at Samkhya Villas was quite poor. We went by the reviews and they are quite misleading. Please do your research well to avoid having a forgettable stay here.

For the price charged, the villa misses some basic features - no safe in the room, TV wasnt working, WiFi was very patchy, no scheduled room service for turn down etc.

The villa itself is designed badly - the shower & toilet are completely open and with the lack of pest control, you run into ants, mosquitoes, bugs, lizards and a whole variety of small pests that make taking a shower a minor adventure. Our bed had ants on them and in the day, we had chameleons popping up near the outdoor pool area. The outdoor area facing the pool doesnt even have a fan and the room has a small AC. In the day, when it gets really hot end up staying in the rooms and that defeats the entire purpose of a private pool villa.

To get to and from the villa to the main road, you need to take a buggy. There are not many options in a walking range around the villa. We got a villa facing the rice fields and while the view is pleasant in the evening, you are woken up to the noise of farming activity and bikes on the road from very early in the morning.

The only bright spot is the service. The staff was outstanding and were available at all times. The food we ordered was of very high quality as well. They really need a better infrastructure to support this quality of service.",Really love the Ambience! It is easier if you come with a driver or motorbike bcs they have separate parking lot and they will pick you up Buggy Car and it is 24/7 so you dont have to worry. Service was good. The room was very nice and clean though they only have 1 Bin and its on the bathroom which was a bit of a struggle for us to throw things away. Food was okay and their cocktails are very good too! Overall it is such a bice experience

kudos to the team, they are really warm and helpful! ‚ù§Ô∏è",The absolute best restaurant experience I have had in my life. The atmosphere is very elegant and romantic. The service and attention to detail was all thorough and well thought out. The food was amazing and there was a vegan/vegetarian menu. Each dish and beverage was very well thought out and our items were all perfectly executed. We came on Christmas for dinner and it was a Christmas that I will never forget.,"We came here with family for dinner and the service and atmosphere were amazing. Our tables had great views and the service was attentive and prompt.

The food is where this restaurant fails. For the price, the quality of food falls far short of expectation. Local warungs offer better food for almost 10% the price.

You come here for the restaurant not the food.",Beautiful visit here for lunch. Definitely large portions. We had a nice view of the river rapids. We would recommend if you're in the area. Prices are typical for 5 star hotel. Excellent flavors.,Wonderful breakfast for my dad's 80 birthday trip to bali. I really appreciate all the staff in restaurant. He laughed so much. And all of us have great memories from you all. Thanks again.

It's really nice to see a fully gluten free place making it inclusive to so many who struggle with gluten although I don't personally, fresh food, no seed oils, friendly staff and owner.

I am mainly vegan and ate the spinach wraps and summer rolls and all was very good! I would love to eat it right now again haha. The service is friendly and heartwarming. It‚Äôs a place where u can easily chat with the owners and strangers. Unity says it already. I guess u also will meet the boss, that‚Äôs a cat and Midnight, the cutest black dog ever.

They have a beautiful dog on site and cute cats you can pat.
Highly recommend. Wonderful service and great wellness center next door.","What a hidden gem! Beautiful place with a chill vibe. Coincidentally met the owner which was super awesome and cool. We spoke about meditation and life, and that already started our Bali trip on the right note. Please order their banana peanut butter smoothie. Crazy delicious! Will definitely be back for their juice and food!!!",The scrambled egg croissant was 10/10. So creamy and yummy. The food was sooooo good. It was very busy and the food came quickly which I was surprised about. Coffee is soft and lovely.

The guide who took me through all the points . I recommend it to try . Just remember you need to pay for camera waterproof bag if you need to opt for it.","THIS ATV TOUR WAS AMAAAZING! I cannot recommend it enough. Our driver Wayan was so amazing and facilitated the perfect Atv experience for us. I cannot stress how amazing this was as I‚Äôve never seen beauty on this earth quite like the scenes I saw on the Atv. I have done quad biking before so I had very low expectations but this was the best activity I did in Bali just because you get to ride through caves and waterfalls and jungles and rice fields.

The staff are extremely friendly, the services or the shoes and hats and showers and toilets are super clean and so well managed. The VIEWS ARE BREATHTAKING YOU HAVE TO DO THIS. The complimentary egg sandwich lunch was very scrumptious too.

I would say it is a bit more scary than I expected with some steep inclines and declines and I definitely did scream but it was a great thrill. Also do ensure when you‚Äôre going up and downhill you stay close to the other Atv bikes as this really makes it easier , they don‚Äôt really stress that enough and I was scared of hitting other atvs due to potential costs but do check with your guides and for uphill and downhill areas you should stay close together and the atvs can bump into each other and they are fine to do so (but double check this)

You have to do this!!! Book with Wayan he‚Äôs so lazing and friendly and professional.","What an absolute blast! We had so much fun. This is a must do activity when you are in Bali.

Would recommend booking otherwise walk up price is twice as much.","This is the surreal experience. The best activity to do in Ubud, Bali. You will enjoy each and every moment while riding the bike. Please if you're not a good rider on the bike please avoid riding this Atv. You can choose a Tandem Atv which means you can sit pillion with your friend who knows how to ride. The Important part is that it is dangerous and you need to be very careful while riding the Atv. This is the 1 hr 30 mins session you go to various places like Mud, river, cave, Waterfall Etc. you must take this experience once. Tandem Atv will cost you around Rp. 500000/- (idr) which is roughly around Rs. 2600 (INR).","Did rafting. Amazing experience. The guide was exceptional, which made rafting more fun. Lunch was delicious as well. I would highly recommend!"

The pork was so juicy and succulent, and was heavenly paired with the broth and chilli sauce. The pork skin was so crispy and fragrant as well. The dish also included vegetables and fish(?) satay which makes it such a hearty meal! Not to mention how affordable this was!

Highly recommend to all visiting Ubud!",Rated by locals as the best babi guling in the area. Friendly ibu,"Simply amazing. Friendly service.
Fresh Babi gluing and very tasty.
Highly recommend","One of the best babi guling restaurants in Ubud. Highly recommended!

They served with the best sambal (chopped chili), well marinated juicy pork, rich broth, and crispy skin. I love to mix the sambal and lawar (veg) with the rice and eat them altogether; very flavourful.","Nice babi going shop. Soup is quite thick. Spiciness 4.5/5 for me. Seems big volume with much vegetables.
Fried intestines are so fresh and crispy!
Jeruk panas (hot orange juice) is my favorite drink."

The only downside that it is little far from Ubud market. If we were near to Ubud it would have been a Five stars.
Overall, a great place to spend some time in calm place like this. :)",Had one of our best stays here. Sparkling clean rooms and a lovely breakfast to start the day. The location is just 5 mins off Ubud center so its quiet and easily accessible.,"place is nice, only thing we didn't like is they didn't change towels for entire stay of ours. toilet was clogged flush was not working great. view was good, beds very comfy.","Looks nice but actually have a bad smell in the kitchen and toilet, the housekeeper was laying on the couch, watching TV at night. It already leaking on sailing and walls, looks so bad eventhough it has Grohe and TOTO. In the morning the electric was down nobody told me the information we couldn't do use closet.
