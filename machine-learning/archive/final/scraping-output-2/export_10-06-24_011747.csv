You can rent your scooter there, they sell beers, have a ping pong table, a nice pool and a big shared open living space.
We love Pecatu guest house, and all the memories we made there!!","This hostel is a nightmare!
The shared rooms and the entire hostel are extremely dirty!! It shouldn't be open to receive tourists!

Very dirty! Very old! Mattresses without comment... trash in the yard everywhere, and the common room is no better... it was the worst hostel I've been to!","Here to clarify all those bad reviews lol because they made me hesitate so long on wether I was booking there or not. To sum it up, you get what you pay for & if you expect standing, like anywhere in the world, pay the price for it. On my end, staff was really helpful on visa extension & tips for trips to nearby islands. Lots of people coming & going so you definitely meet cool people along the way. Live music nights are such a vibe, locals are so talented!!!! Big up to all the staff! I'll see you soon if I pass by Ulu again","Place looks like a crack den, nothing like the pics online. Dirty bathrooms and bunks. Staff dont even say hello, goodbye or thank you, regret giving them money. Asked for a bottom bunk too as i have a knee injury and they couldnt care less, they already got my money. Never again","Best vibes in Uluwatu. If you wanna stay in an hostel, this is the choice.

The downside was seeing the Lewaks in cages. Single Lewaks were placed in concrete cages, and they could be seen pacing up and down (symptoms of zoosis). This is not a place for people concerned with animal welfare or animal rights.

The have a great selection of food, also with many delicious vegetarian and vegan option. The prices are good and cheap as well, the plate on the picture was 25k.

The seating area in the back is also really comfortable and not so noisy because it is a little bit sealed off from the street.

The service is also very nice.","Very nice local warung with many places to sit. They sell quite a large variety of foods, ranging from nasi campur to smoothie bowls and coffee. Honestly, the reason I keep coming back here are their smoothie bowls, especially the MangoNana.",Good dishes and good value for money. The atmosphere of this warung is very local and authentic. We loved having dinner hier after attending kecak dance and fire show  ( that I recommend btw),Cutest local place with a lovely chill spot in the back away from the road. Very friendly family with delicious food and smoothies. Very good prices as well! Vegetarian friendly options. Food is fresh and served with a smile :),Really nice Place with large choice of food for your Nasi Campur ! Really nice family and this restaurant have place on the back really quiet in compare to the front street. Good price also for Uluwatu.

Our driver recommended.
To taste the Luwak coffee you need to pay.
There is also a small shop if you like particular types.","Staff shares information of how coffee is made. Afterwhich will provide free 15 cups of various coffee and tea for tasting. If you would like to taste luwak coffee, it's priced at 50k and served with cassava chips","Probably one of the most unique coffee and tea establishments that I have ever visited!
They specialize in Luwak coffee, that is ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù initially by a species of mongoose called a Luwak.
They eat the ripe coffee beans, because they like the red pulpy coating, then poop out the ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù and intact coffee bean later on (usually within a day or so).
The beans are then cleaned and roasted, and ground into a fine powder by hand that makes an excellent coffee with a strong and unique flavor profile.
We had 15 samples of teas and coffees that they sell at no charge, but had to pay about $2 US for a cup of Luwak coffee to try.
I ended up buying a small bag of Luwak coffee (100 grams) for about $14 US.
Expensive, but it is so unique I had to buy some to take home!
We also enjoyed many of their teas and their Bali cacao.
Plan to stop in for some time to relax in their garden, do some tastings, and browse through their shop.","Our driver showed us this place after the excursion. We tasted various coffee and tea variations. It was nice but nothing special. We bought cocoa, but when I converted the price, I realized it was too expensive. I don't understand why it's called a 'plantation.' It looks more like an ordinary caf√© with a terrace and poor animals in cells.","I stopped by here to view the coffee plantation. This is so cool. They give several types of tea and coffee to try out for free. I am not into caffeine, so just tried non-caffeinated teas. I really liked the mangosteen. For those of you who want to try the special Balinese Luwak coffee which comes from the poop of Luwak, you have to pay for it (I am not into it though)."

I discovered that the lower rating was due to a non-representative evaluation! Please report it if you read this, as it concerns a delivery issue, not the restaurant experience itself. The food is very nice, and the quality-to-price ratio is amazing! A 5-star experience!","Real authentic Thai food! ü§§ Absolutely delicious!! HIGHLY recommend the Tom Kha Gai soup and the Pad See Ew noodles. If you like Thai food, this restaurant will definitely not disappoint üëå","The food is authentic, just as if one were in Thailand. I would highly recommend their spring rolls.","This place has really good Thai food at a great price. Entrees range from 50-80k, all super delicious. Curry is thick and delicious.

Literally the price changed from 50K to 40K for us after I asked our driver to talk to the owner. That's bad service. Am not going back.",This is the place i usually go for a plate of nasi be guling when i'm in pecatu area in the past 2-3 years. Good taste and great sambal. Own and run by the whole family.,"There are no price in the menu, that means if you're tourist the price for you is high enough. For the usual dish in this place with chip interior and bad service I paid like for such dish in good cafe with great interior and excellent service. I don't advise this place"
