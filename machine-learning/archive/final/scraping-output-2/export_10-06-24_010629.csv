They gave recommendations and answered our queries patiently. The pork satay is recommended and so is the mac n cheese. Mango cocktail was humongous to be shared with 4 people too! The atmosphere was comfortable as well. Definitely good place to visit for a meal!,"My second time here, and it‚Äôs easily one of the best pork ribs you will ever find in Bali!

Their pork ribs are super tender! When u lift the meat, the bone will literally fall off on its own. However I was hoping for them to be more generous with their BBQ sauce that was coating the meat.

Their mac and cheese was also decent, although the portion is relatively small.

Interesting, the star of this meal was not the ribs, but the nachos instead! This is the first time where the ratio of nachos to pulled pork is 1:2! They should change their name to pulled pork with nachos! üòÇ Pulled pork was delightful, and the cheese and sauce and nachos made every single bite heavenly! Must order if you ever visit this place!

Oh and please do yourself a favor and do not order their deep fried duck (bebek). Super dry, bland and expensive.

Ribs: Rp198k
Can‚Äôt recall the pricing for the rest..",Came here on a weekday night. We waited only 10 minutes for a group of 10 even though it seemed full from the outside. The service was fast yet they still managed to prepare such a delicious dish. The pork ribs are a must try. It is so tender and slides off the bone easily. The pork satay is super flavourful as well. The crispy pork skin was so crunchy and the fats literally melt in your mouth. Must visit place if you live around Seminyak. I will definitely come back again if I visit Bali in the future. This is seriously one of the best BBQ pork I've ever eaten.,"Absolutely loved this place! My husband and I came here two days in a row, first day we had the pork satay, truffle fries and pork tacos each dish was delicious! The following day we had the ribs, and Mac and cheese both were excellent! Might have been the best Mac and cheese we‚Äôve ever had! This place is always very busy but they do a good job getting people in and out. We waited about 40 minutes for a table but we‚Äôre happy to be able to enjoy a beer while we waited which was a bonus! Once we sat and ordered our food was in front of us in less then 10 minutes! 11/10 would recommend to anyone!","This is really close to a 5 for me. It's super busy there and that's because they know what they're doing and they do it well.

Nevertheless I found the dishes I ordered either hit or miss. The dishes I ordered mains are great, pork spare ribs were totally worth it and the chicken pop/bites were a generous portion, well worth the price. If I were here with 1 or 2 others, I might suggest ordering one or both as appetizers to share.

I felt the sides were a let down. I had the garlic bread, the coleslaw and the BBQ corn (which didn't taste very BBQ'd). They were all quite mediocre. It's a shame the fries and wedges come with truffle seasoning, which I hate.

I would come again to try a few other things but hope they improve their sides offering.

Also it's not the cheapest. I paid over 500k for my food and 2 bottles of Bintang."

Freshly baked croissants in the morning, great coffee selection, beautiful. I got the almond croissant and shakerato.
The almond croissant was a mix of flaky and moist, lovely. The sweetness was just right, and they're generous with the almonds, both the slices and the paste inside.
They also serve brunch menus and sandwiches.
Service is very friendly.","This establishment is renowned as the premier destination for sourdough enthusiasts in Badung, consistently attracting a bustling crowd. Its popularity is a testament to the quality of its offerings. This observation prompts reflection on the intrinsic value of excellence and the allure of sought-after destinations. In the perpetual influx of patrons, we find a reminder of the universal pursuit of quality and distinction. It serves as a testament to the enduring appeal of excellence and the power of reputation in shaping our choices and experiences. Through this culinary phenomenon, we are reminded of the profound impact that dedication to craft and commitment to quality can have on capturing the hearts and minds of individuals. It underscores the importance of striving for excellence in all endeavors and the transformative power it holds in shaping our perceptions and experiences.","Really love every single detail of this place, starting from the food, we ordered Eggs Benedict and Hazelnut Croissant (best seller). Everything was perfect! The staffs there always keep an eye on all customers, they didn‚Äôt neglect the people outdoor and the food came out 5-10 minutes after we order which was really fast. Good vibes only.","Nestled on the bustling Mertanadi Street, Braud Cafe is a small but vibrant spot that promises a delightful breakfast experience. Despite its busy atmosphere, the service is remarkably efficient and friendly.

For breakfast, I opted for their bread and butter paired with a cappuccino. The serving included 5-6 slices of their freshly baked bread accompanied by a homemade garlic cream butter that was absolutely divine. The bread was fresh and perfectly toasted, providing a crisp exterior with a soft, moist interior that made each bite a pleasure.

Impressed by the quality, I couldn't resist taking home two of their sourdough country loaves. The loaves were exceptional‚Äîsuper moist on the inside with a perfectly crisp crust. The sourdough's tangy flavor and hearty texture were so enjoyable that I could easily see myself eating it all day.

As a finishing touch, I tried their buttery croissant, which was the perfect blend of flaky and rich. The croissant‚Äôs delicate layers and buttery goodness were a testament to Braud Cafe‚Äôs expertise in baking. It was a delightful addition that rounded off my visit perfectly.

Braud Cafe not only offers great food but also an inviting ambiance and top-notch service. Whether you‚Äôre grabbing a quick breakfast or taking some artisanal bread home, this cafe is a must-visit for bread enthusiasts and coffee lovers alike.","This is my favourite place in Kerobokan, I come here 1/2 a week and these guys are killing itüôè

The brand, the vibe, the staff and the food are always over expectations, you may see a line outside and a waiting list in or early mornings.
They make one of the best egg benedicts I ever tried and sweet juices are very good too.
I usually take:
1 anti aging, 1 cold pressed orange juice, 1 egg benedict with smoked salmon, 1 coffee and 1 chocolatine.

You would be surprised but even their playlist is very cool, they have a channel on Spotify where they share it.

I was recently informed that they have another branch of this in Jakarta and they are planning to open another one soon In Uluwatu.

Keep it up guys, you rock!"

The room was rather nice and simple; however during my visit there, the room has little to no noise retention so sometimes, we can hear noise, coming outside the windows.

What dissapoints me the most though, is the fact that we weren't able to freely control the temperature (or anything else) of the air conditioner, so the only way to adjust the room temperature is through asking the managers about it... It would be nice if hotel managers would allow visitors to adjust the room temperature freely.

Other than that, I believe that the location is rather strategic and we enjoyed our stay in this hotel...","location is strategic, there are many options of food just by walking near the hotel.

Service is top notch. staffs are friendly. I bring a car, the parking area is small but free valet service is available. on top of that, our car is being cleaned when returned. thank you so muchüò≠üò≠

however, room-wise, you can find a better room within the same range price. the room is too minimalist, especially the toilet. the electric plugs inside the room outside the toilet is too few only 2, one beside bed and the other one is on the table for water kettle. loved the sofa beside the window tho.

Also, one thing I‚Äôm disappointed at is the jacuzzi is on maintenance when I‚Äôm there, which is one crucial thing when choosing this hotel.","Stay for 1 night, the room is minimalist and quite nice, extra points for clean and spotless bed sheet (stay at another hotel night before and totally disgusted by their dirty bed sheet, so this one is a pretty nice change for me). The downsides are bidet not working (their repairman staff come and fix it at once), air conditioner is not cool enough (the same repairman staff come again and fix it at once, thank you üôèüèª) and their car parking area isn't too big and we need to use their hotel valet services since they're full booked during my stay (it's part of the hotel service and there's no extra charge, but we still need to wait since the car parked at another location from the hotel). Appreciated reception staff and repairman staff work ethic and hospitality.","Great place to stay, rooms are standard sized but designed really well. The shower and toilets are modern, definitely great.
For the price, I'd say this is one of the best hotels to stay if you're going around Seminyak and Canggu.","i stayed here for 2 nights with 7months baby.
The room not really big for me. just standart. you can find another hotel, better than this with the same range i think.
But the most important things when u go with baby is, the bath room, they have shower, and it can be hold by your hand.

All staff are friendly and really helpful.
We were so glad to met them"

The Foodies and Beverages, food quality are quite good and also make an impressive feedback from my friends they are really like it how the foodies are serve om the table, but tge server need to know more about the product knowledge especially for the pairings. The looks and aesthetic from the beverage and food are very nice and instagramable, nothing much to complain about.

The ambience, nuances, atmosphere and vibes, are not really that good cz the music are a bit mismatched from the vibes and design of the building itself, the people around are enjoying it and me too, but again we are enjoying the vibe of a dinner, so doesn't really into the music. The table placing are nice and good still got lot of spaces while you're walking around and the area also easy to find but not much of a car parking area

The staff are friendly and nice with a great service value that they're applying to the guests and ask for feedback.

Really love the Dirty Hot Chocolate, it's so comforting & I love how you can choose the % of cacao. I got the 75% one and it's perfect for a dark chocolate lover like me. The cheese cake is so good too, and so is the madeline. The Chocolate cake isn't my cup of tea but my friend love it. Frozen hot chocolate is lovely too, and I love the mocachino, but my no 1 is still the dirty hot chocolate.

The place is spacious, clean, quiet (most times), with air conditioned and outdoor area. Great wifi too.

There's a make your own chocolate area & a small chocolate making exhibition, so perfect for kids or adults who are interested in activities like that.

The chocolate bars are lovely too. The chilli one tastes quite yummy, surprisingly. Coffee flavoured one is so good too.

We paid around 300k each and it was worth every rupiah.
Before I go any further id like to say that I‚Äôm the type of person that enjoys good honest food.

They have a bus that will shuttle you back to your residence if staying in seminyak, Only negative input I have is that the shuttle driver picks and chooses who he wants to drop off.

The staff are incredibly helpful and attentive - reception is open 24hours, I flew out in the early morning and so they gave me a little breakfast box I could eat on the go! Housekeeping even clean up the fallen leaves in the garden daily and will come by late afternoon/early evening to light a mozzie coil so you can sit comfortably outside.

Location is also great, there's a couple of coffee shops and a number of restaurants anywhere between a 3 and 15 minute walk away, in particular Merah Putih and Sangsaka. Not to mention the gorgeous Bodyworks Day Spa is just a 10 minute walk away.","This is a four-room villa that can be shared by families. It has a spacious swimming pool and one room with an indoor bathroom and another room with an outdoor bathroom on the first floor, plus a large, air-conditioned common room with a dining table and a kitchen that is unsuitable for cooking due to lack of air conditioning and poor gas stove. The second floor has two rooms with outdoor bathrooms.
The villa was old and broke down a lot, and there were many bugs and mosquitoes due to the rainy season. Once again, I would like to thank the careful staff who put on mosquito repellents and took care of them every day for my family who were worried about mosquitoes.
The villa staff was very friendly and always active in helping my family. They always used the villa's car to drive me to the Sminyak area, and they always picked me up and took me to the door with a buggy.
This villa is located close to Sminyak's restaurants, so it's easy to move around and it's usually quiet. However, you should note that for a few days, you can hear the music of a nearby club and there is a construction noise because the villa next door is under repair.
The TV in the rooms except for the common living room is not very good. My family and I watched TV together and didn't have much inconvenience because we didn't watch TV in our own rooms. And the fridge in the kitchen was very big enough to hold food and drinks, but it was too hot and there were a lot of bugs in the kitchen because there was no air conditioning, and only one of the four gas stoves could be operated
The bathtub in the room was not clean, so we never used it, and we used the pool in our accommodation every day, so a shower was enough. The pool was clean and spacious, so it was so nice to play in the water together with my family.
Breakfast was excellent. At first, we ate comfortably in the living room in our villa, but the food was so cold that we especially wanted to enjoy a warm coffee, so we went to the restaurant for the last two days and enjoyed breakfast
This villa is old and needs to be improved, but it's not inconvenient, and the excellent breakfast, overall beautiful villa, spacious swimming pool, and friendly staff make up for the shortfall. I will definitely go to Villa air bali again if the broken things are fixed and repaired, and I appreciate the service I received from staying in the villa for a week was superb.","Cannot say enough wonderful things about this place - the service was absolutely superb as all of the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. The resort itself is not very big which was nice bc it felt very safe and intimate. They do cleaning service twice a day so our villa was always quite clean and neat. We tried the massage and spa services and enjoyed them thoroughly. The restaurant was good too although not the best food we had in Bali.

Do not even think about it. Booked for a week & didn‚Äôt stay a night.

The rooms stink of damp & the cleaning standards are non existent. Manager is a rude beitch & didn‚Äôt accept that the standards were poor.

The photos tell the real story of their standards. Even the cupboard in the room was full of trash. Just appalling.","This is by far the worst ‚Äúhotel‚Äù in Bali, the kitchen is just decoration, the pool  does not exist! They will always say they are in maintenance and the staff is super rude.

Traveling with a baby, I was concerned about the baby's health. The room was not properly cleaned and overall, it wasn't clean. We experienced harassment from the staff, like putting a questionable bathmat in the baby crib, which led us to change hotels. There were both good and terrible staff members, but in any case, it was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. They didn't refund us for the remaining days after we changed hotels, and it was the travel agency that provided us with compensation. I will never stay there again.","Bad experience. Never book room there. ac was not working properly, no gas for cooking available, sound was coming from machinery somewhere above the room. Reception remains empty most of the time. No restaurant or kitchen for guest to order. Gates remain open in the night, so safety could be an issue.

Also, do ask locker number to put ur cash into it, n change it. We had a feeling that our cash was missing. The room service team has access to ur rooms so beware with ur stuff."

The sleeping area was nice and had been scented. My room was nice and cold, and dark enough at night.
My stay ended early due to some inconsiderate roommates which was a bummer, but that's hostel life.

The superior is very roomy and the balcony is a nice addition to relax. The pool is big and always clean. There are cafes and restaurants withing walking distance, a local bar is located nearby, it can get loud but once you are inside the hotel, I could barely hear it.

Super easy to get around with scooter rides definitely recommend very good price, they also gave small bottles of water every day.","Beautiful clean rooms, friendly and helpful staff, good location. Cold air conditioning and super comfortable beds! Only reason I‚Äôm giving it a 4/5 stars is the roosters are very noisy right outside our room. Other than that it‚Äôs a lovely place to stay!","Stayed here for 2 nights and had a lovely time with the rooms and services

If you‚Äôre a light sleeper then this place might not be for you as there will be music coming from a nearby bar/club and sounds of a hundred roosters in the early morning.
Sounds can also be heard from room to room

But luckily i can doze off quite easily so no issue for me here.

Location wise, it is great and nearby most interesting places. Rooms are kept clean and odour free. Would recommend if you are NOT a light sleeper üëçüèº"

We ate at the tepanyaki bar and marvelled at the skill of the chef.
The seafood and meat are cooked to perfection, accompanied by a variety of vegetables and sauces.
Special mention for the green tea and black sesame ice cream :)
Some might view the price on the high side but it's well worth it compared to what you would pay in Europe.
The owner, Ray, makes a point of saying hello to customers, which is nice.
All in all, we loved it!","Highly recommended!
My favorite restaurant so far in Bali
Amazing food, great service and nice ambient. Thanks for the great night, we will soon come back again.","We booked for Teppanyaki, with a Gluten Free participant., those with GF Partners will understand the complexities of finding venues that provide suitable variety.

From the confirmation of booking to being seated GF was acknowledged and substitutes provided.

Everyone has their own way of starting a meal, mates love a Cold Beer (I was assured they had these) ours is with cocktails.
- 1 spicy drink not on the menu, and modified a second to make it spicy was not a trouble at all..... both sensational.

Then which set menu?

Bram our chef said we were the first in his 6+ plus years to substitute a dish for Lobster ü¶û, but we just weren't feeling Barramundi, and we didnt fell.like 6 mains, so it didn't hurt to ask...
- naturally it adds to the cost but it was certainly more than fair.

Bram is very skilled at his profession, there were a few things, I am optimistic of replicating on my BBQ.

We still had left overs, and they tasted as good in the morning, left over Lobster and Champagne is a great way to start the day when on Holidays.

Ray thanks for taking the punt on opening a great venue, everything was Fantastic. I need to bring more people to give those T-Bones and especially those Tomahawks a run.

We hope to see you in late June.

The ramen are good with decent noodles and sides. Perfect for giving your stomach a fatty soupy base before spending the night partying.

There‚Äôs a parking lot next to this place in an abandoned building. Staff was nice, place was relatively clean too. It has retro arcade game machines and a secret bar upstairs.","Visited 10may 24.

Went at 11am.
Was only one.
Lol.
Food good and hearty enough.
Portion was good.
Service was great - I was THE ONLY ONE.
But to fair, the servers were smiles all over.

I guess it's good Afterall... Others commented the same anyway.

Pay a visit!","Mad Ronin in Bali offers a memorable ramen experience that's hard to beat. With a carefully curated menu, each bowl of ramen is a testament to authentic flavors and quality ingredients. The ambiance is cozy and inviting, perfect for casual dining. Service is friendly, adding to the overall positive experience. While the wait times can occasionally stretch longer than expected, the delicious end result justifies the patience required. A definite go-to for ramen lovers in Bali, Mad Ronin falls just short of perfection but remains a solid choice for a flavorful meal.","Got the Tonkotsu Black Garlic Ramen for about Rp 85,000 which is half the price of what people would typically get in our home country, as well as the chicken karaage and the tamagoyaki.

The ramen was really just mid, as much as it looked good it did not taste good. Texture was strange, and was really too savoury at the end. Tasted a lot of MSG and texture was not of ramen soup base. Chicken karaage was ok, but the tamagoyaki was definitely lacking - was cold and not that sweet. Not a satisfactory dinner at all.

The atmosphere of the ramen place in general was just not it - the server turned off the lights halfway of an empty corner, while we totally understand it is to save costs, the corner was actually right before we were situated at so lighting became even more dim than it was already.

What ruined the impression of the restaurant further was that we were not allowed to drink our own plain water in our own bottles. I understand that some restaurants put out this practice to encourage customers to buy the beverages from them, but ramen is a very savoury dish and to 'ban' people from drinking just their own water is not very tasteful of the outlet.

The only saving graces are the photobooths to take pictures and mini arcade, but note that the photobooths require e-payment so do check if you have the relevant card/digital wallet to pay for it.","Bomb ramen and aesthetic place.

They didn't have many menus, but they didn't disappoint at all.

We ordered the tonkatsu classic and the black garlic, but I very much prefer the classic because the other one was too salty for my liking. The grilled pork gyoza is also good.

Notes for ordering here:
They will give you a slip of paper of the menu to fill out when you sit down.  They will come to your table once you are done filling it.
Also, they didn't have QRIS payment, only card and cash."
