First time walking on cooled down lava for me. Unlucky for us it was too cloudy on that day and we didn't get to see the sunrise.

Beware that the route is super steep and slippery due to sand.","Amazing view and sunrise. Quite the walk up and down, did it in my crocs","It was fun, especially when you arrived at the peak of the mountain Batur, but get ready for the crowd of the tourists that may obstruct the view & the fly that flying around you",Not a trek for the physically-unprepared.,Amazing view
