Just a few minutes walk from the pet market. Room is decent clean and clean bedsheets. In general hotel could have been bit more tide specially spider web on the walls but  as compared to the price no complain about that at all. There's lots of space outside the room to seat and in the balcony on every floor which was wonderful. Although there was no sink in the bathroom that was bit disappointment but still with the price I didn't complain and yes WiFi wasn't good.

Make sure you check the bathroom wether flush is working or not second time when we stayed there. Room was big but bathroom was really bad.","I made a reservation for two people for one night through the booking app.
I sent message let they know that I would be late as my flight would be late..

Upon arriving at the hotel at about 04:00 am they inform me that the hotel it was completely full and that the room he had for me had been reserved, to which I replied that I could do it at 04:00 in the morning in a city I don't know, and which hotel would receive me at that time.

The only option they gave me after asking was to sleep in reception until the next morning.

Being 08:30 am still no one comes to tell us what happened, not even an apology.

If you want to feel demoted as a person this place is perfect for you.

Greetings to the owner and remember that everything is returned.","Room prices are made on the spot by looking at your face. Dough the printed sheet at the counter indicates a different price but then the staff pretends that they dont know english.

Well, they can charge any amount but keep it the same for everyone, besides this major point the place is nice has reliable internet connectivity and is within a peaceful environment including silent area.","I wasnt about letting a bad review as i didn't expected too much from a OYO hotel .but now i can say this was my worst experience here.

the price wasn't especially cheap  (285k / night ) considering all the cons: the room and commun areas were really dirty and old ,no wifi , no bedsheets on the bed(?), no towels,  stains and mold everywhere , sanitary is really limited . Aircon remote is kept by the staff so it's not possible to use it, there is a fan on the ceiling but it is old and dangerous so better not use it, that's ok if you are used to hot temperatures but the dust in the room makes it unbreathable

above all, the staff is not even  kind or helpful. My husband got hospitalized, so i was alone to deal with the luggages on 3 floors, staff just watched me struggling and when i asked for help ,said  'no' and kept doing nothing ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I certainly not go back there or recommend anyone to go . if you are short on options , there is probably better and cheaper in that same area.","It‚Äôs a bit of a scam, for a hotel, but could be fine if you are travelling as backpacker ( no water in the bathroom, no blanket, poor cleaning ) but very cheap
You have to know that they will charge an extra fee of 50000 explaining that Booking doesn‚Äôt let them change the fees
Apart from that it is well placed in the city, and very quiet"

Staff are knowledgeable local guides, and very caring.","I found another hidden gem for working cafe. The ambience is so perfect for work, great light and table setting. The food and beverage are quite affordable. I recommend their meat lover pizza, 55k for a chewy and tasty pizza is worth it. They have enough space for car and motorcycle.","This is my 2nd time this week coming to this cafe.
I'm so addicted to their Crispy Pork Belly and Mashed Potato!
They're wonderful!
Mind you, it's very hard to find a good crispy pork belly and mashed, and I'm soooo happy that it's just near my house!

But sadly the mashed isn't available to be ordered separately, you have to order the steak that come with mashed :'

Well, I've no other option then. I ended up ordering 2 main dish (Wiku Crispy Pork Belly, and Chicken Steak) haha.. :'D
Can't finish it, but have to.

Anyone from Wiku please hear me out :')
Let the mashed be on the menu too"

- Matcha (‚≠êÔ∏è8/10) is a bit light with too much milk.
- Chocolate brownies (‚≠êÔ∏è9/10) are melted and hot, served with additional vanilla ice cream (+10k).
- The food and drinks are affordable, excluding tax.
- The menu mostly consists of Indonesian food, including spaghetti, desserts, and cakes displayed.
