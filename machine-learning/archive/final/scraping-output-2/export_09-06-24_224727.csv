Other than that, there is very little to do here. Do take note that you have to pay for a ticket for your photo to be taken by the on-site photographers. The payment is small but the wait can take up to 45 minutes depending on the crowd. Heading into the gates will bring you to a 5 star golf resort after a short drive.","Nice place for taking a photo. Depending on the time of day, it can be busy, meaning it will take a long time before it is your turn. There are no toilets available. If you are short on time, the staff who arranges everything can help you to skip the line and take your photo earlier. Just a matter of asking them nicely.",Go there in the morning because it gets crowded. I‚Äôve waited 1hour for 20 people before me to take some photos. You pay an entrance fee and you also pay in cash for the photos if you want to take some with the gate. There is no place buy refreshments so keep that in mind to bring water with you while you wait. Nice photos result if you‚Äôre willing to wait.,"Waste of Time.

This is just a Gate of Handara Golf and Resort.

Vehicles are regularly passing.

You have to wait like a whole day if you don't reach by 9-10 am.

You can Happily skip this without any regrets.","Wonder how this spot even got listed on the first place amidst popular bali locations. It's a private golf property whose entrance resembles the popular gateway of heaven, and hence folks line up to get their photos clicked. It has a parking fee, and an entrance fee, just for this photo spot. And the guard whistles to drive you away if you try to click a photo without entering. Can be totally skipped, just like the Lempuyang temple if you are not just looking for a photo."

The staff is so humble, taste of strawberry is sweet and price is affordable. Recommended","The second time me and my partner were here. I think among all strawberry picking, so far this is the best farm. My partner is bule so maybe thats why I pay 15k per person entrance and you pay 5000 per one ounce of strawberry. We get bunch 1.3kg only for 60k. Cheapy!! They give you free fresh strawberry juice too. Better come here morning before everyone gets in.","Good place, good price, good people! They told us honestly that they don't have much strawberry ready to be picked, so we may decide in advance whether to stop by or not..
They also sell strawberry juice, which is super fresh and tasty even with just a bit addition of sugar"

The place looks gloomy and dark. It has an outdoor and indoor seating areas. There is a rest room, too, conveniently located on the outer seating area. Eventhough from the entrance, the place looks small and dark, but it has a bright and spacious outdoor area.  One can just walk around and enjoy the space there. As it was hot and sunny, we decided to sit in the indoor area to enjoy the fan inside.
We ordered the Nasi Ayam Lalapan and Nasi Goreng ikan masin. As usual the white rice is seperately charged. The food are not tasty or appetising. It is just okay.
There is nothing special here. The staff are friendly and accomodating. It was a quick lunch as we had other places to visit.","We always have lunch here until Covid arrived and shut many restaraunts down. Ten Ten Bamboe is now open again. Good quality traditional food and limited Western food available and of course the same friendly staff. Pricing is fair and service excellent. Please give them a go. We always do & never disappointed.
Delicious strawberries avail as well to take home.","The worst meal I ever had in Bali. They charged a rip-off price for everything, especially 240k + 15% tax and service fee for the crispy duck meal and 90k + 15% for 7 small pieces of calamari. The place was dirty and full of flies. I would nominate this place as a tourist scam recommended by the driver (GALUNG Trans)."

What made the experience even more special was meeting the kind owner and his beautiful family. They were incredibly hospitable and went out of their way to make sure we had a wonderful dining experience. It's clear that they take great pride in their restaurant and are dedicated to providing their customers with the best possible service.

The ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and inviting, with a rustic feel that adds to the overall charm. The staff were friendly and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal.

Overall, I had a fantastic experience at Waroeng Glory Pizza Bedugul and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for delicious food and great service.","We were tired and hungry, we chose this place based on good reviews, but were disappointed. The portions are very small, even my child didn‚Äôt get enough.

They take a long time to cook and when my son and I had already eaten, my husband waited another 15 minutes for his dish. The food was certainly delicious, but for this price it was not enough; we did not expect that 1 portion of spaghetti was about half the size of a normal portion.

I don't recommend this place",Amazing pizza for great price. We bought a medium take away pizza for two people. The owner was so kind and he speaks really good english. This place is a must if you‚Äôre in the zone and want pizza. I would repeat without doubt!!,"We found exactly what we were craving here. It‚Äôs not what you would find in Italy, but it‚Äôs good for the area.
The vegetarian one has a lot of corn, maybe ask for less if you‚Äôre not a fan."

Additionally we were quite surprised with the food, unexpectedly it was quite good, considering the price is not expensive. Will visit again next time.

We ordered the Bebek Goreng (their speciality), and the sauce was really nice, but it was quite spicy, if you don't like spicy you probably want to try the other menu","Excellent place to eat when you are visiting Handara gate.
