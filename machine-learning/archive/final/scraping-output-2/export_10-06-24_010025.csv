One of the best accommodations near Canggu area. The place is clean, new, with everything that you need. Great swimming pool and view on rice terraces. Located in a quite area, you can easily get from here to canggu/seseh. The host couple is very friendly, ready to help you with everything, so you can feel like at home here. Highly recommend","The place was perfect for us. Our stay at Henrynatha guesthouse was excellent. The place is new, clean, and well-maintained. Facilities work perfectly, and the boutique-style decor, along with rooftop access, was a pleasant surprise. It's conveniently located, with Seseh beach nearby and Changgu just a 15-minute drive away. The couple who runs the place is friendly, accommodating, and treated us like family. Great place to escape to if you’re wanting more quietude and pristine vistas without sacrificing convenience and access to what Changgu has to offer. Highly recommended for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.","comfortable place to stay, special for the upper rooms, we can see the sunrise in the morning, we also get a view of green rice fields, the facilities are also good, there is a swimming pool too, only 5 minutes to Tanah Lot Temple, I really recommend this place to stay","A comfortable place to stay, the rooms are spacious and clean.
