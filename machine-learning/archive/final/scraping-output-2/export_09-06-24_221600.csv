The Ikan Bakar(grilled fish) and Ayam Bakar( frilled chicken) went really well with the rice and onion Chilli.
We ordered fried prawn w/o flour - Asam Manis pedas sauce. They served fried krill and it was the best dish.","Good food in a good place. I love how the fish are fresh (you can see the fish before they grill it) and the food came in big portions. I shared my order with my friend. For the taste, they can add more spices to them but it's still good.

Sadly, the food preparation was too long (took 1 hour for it to come out when the restaurant is empty) so I didn't recommend it if you want to take a quick bite.

They have a spacious parking lot.","They serve good grilled fish. We tried Paket 2 for 70k which has a lot of dishes (fish, sate lilit, pepes, plecing kangkung, and sambal matah). Every single thing was good, and it can be shared with 2 people. However, the fans were broken and it was super hot, so we decided to eat the food at our hotel instead.","The warung has nice ambience and has spacious garden with gravels. The food is comparatively good, but the preparation is so so long. I have waited for almost an hour to get grilled fish with fish soup, satay, and pepes. The staff must smile and welcoming guests more.","Come to this place because of good reviews and it totally not disappoint. The grilled fish is really good. Spent 200k for 5 people, definitely will come back if i ever go to Buleleng again."

Its a moment we will forever remember from our road trip around Bali ☺️
Rooms are very cosy, clean and comfortable, with very friendly hosts open for conversation!  Honest recommendation for all fellow travelers! ♥️",My partner and I had a lovely time at Les Cantik Homestay! The owners Made and Ketut did everything to make us comfortable and introduced us to the local culture. Ketut made a special local drink for us with roasted coconut and a special herb jelly and Made showed me how to prepare the offerings for the daily prayer. The local beach is really close and great for snorkelling with many coral and fish species. Just next door is a cheap warung that offers great food! Recommend to anyone that wants to get to know the locals and have a pleasant time :) thank you for inviting us into your home,"The owner, room and everything was fine.. perfect homestay",Nice place n familiar owner,The palce feel like home with rural experience
