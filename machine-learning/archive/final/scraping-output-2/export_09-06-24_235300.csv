Don't miss out on brownie if you like sweets:) My friend and I stopped by for a quick coffee, because it looked so cozy when we were passing by with a scooter. I also ordered noodles (looked simple, but surprisingly - very tasty), my friend said that a dessert with jelly and watermelon was refreshing. When I was about to leave, Sketchy (a girl managing a cafe) gave me two cakes made by her mother. Both cakes were so good, especially brownie. They had all fridge of different cakes, it was such a cool thing to see in a non-touristy place. Great atmosphere and also a couple working there spoke english very well.",Really good ! We visit Bali and eat here very well,,,
