The villa is amazing great seating areas and ease of access is good too. Such as ordering food from nearby restaurants or organizing tours or transportation.

If you plan to stay know the following...
-Take the transport provided by villa 650k from airport, great service and assistance.
- if you eat a lot bring extra food for your first day
- make your shopping list for food. Staff will do shopping for you and you must pay in advance.
- bring batteries. There were very little amount of batteries for in house remotes we had some which we used for the fan.
- if you like alcohol (spirits) bring duty free. Local price was quite expensive but beer and wine at a good price.
- request a ""how to tour"" from the manager. How to use the pool lighting, fans, stereo, tv, etc. We only saw the manager for 5min on day one so get as much info as you can. He lives about 1hr away.
- there is ocean beautiful ocean views but beach front area is quite dirty. We found a clean beach area in nearby Lovina.

This villa has the potential to be a luxury accommodation it only lacks polish. (Consistent lighting, finer linens, beach front maintenance, batteries)",Great house with pool and acces to the Beach. Comes with extremely helpfull staff. Top location!,"A private villa in hidden place near lovina,,the beach was clean, the atmosphere was good and realy calm,",,

The kitchen side is well equipped too. Good bathroom with a separate shower from the rest. We enjoyed the washing machine. Very close to the beach with a quiet sea to swim. The pool was fun to have a plonge.
We only had a power shortage in the night due to the expiration of kwh credit. So no more AC. We woke up early and could use our bicycle lights‚Ä¶ if we knew it we would have added credit before the night. Maybe some candles and matches would be useful.
Quite a nice stay overall.","I dont like this place because this place makes me DONT WANT TO LEAVE üò≠üò≠..its sooooo comfortable Homeyy and very Clean ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞when i meant clean , it is very very very clean ...place is quiet , located at the rice fileds area ,

Please be aware that if you book this place and get into unforseen circumstances to cancel your trip, 50% deposit or the full amount will be gone - there is no corporation!

My family booked this place for a family reunion 4 months prior the trip without our knowledge. Due to pregnancy that was revealed shortly after booking it was clear that we wouldn‚Äôt risk the trip 6 months pregnant and had to change itinerary.

Despite these unforeseen circumstances more than 3 months prior to the trip there was no corporation. They took 50% of our deposit (+$1,600).

Running a shortstay business ourselves we understand a no refund policy but seeing no flexibility with over 3 months notice is totally unacceptable in my view.

We would have loved to take the full trip at Villa Saffraan at a later stage in form of a credit but will definitely not do so anymore.

Highly disappointing customer service!","Where can I even begin‚Ä¶..
firstly, the reason I come back here is the staff!!!! They are the kindest, most helpful, friendly and truest remarkable people! The owner is very nice and always accommodating, he wants to make sure your stay is amazing!

The first time you visit, you wonder where you are headed! The path to lovina can sometimes take 3-3.5 hours from the airport but my god it‚Äôs worth it! The driver Putu is a lovely man, and always happy to help you. You can stop at places along the way ( I recommend the coffee plantation, chocolate factory & the temples and rice fields on the way). The area of lovina is just bustling with friendly and genuine people: the views are amazing and you are right in front of the beach at the Villa. The house itself is lovely and the pool is fantastic! The pool has an attached shallow area which is perfect for young kids.

There are many fun things to do including the water park! And snorkelling with the dolphins! It‚Äôs worth doing a day trip to Menjangan island too! üòé

Suci and Ida are there every morning to make you a lovely breakfast and are always willing to make anything you ask.! If they don‚Äôt have it, they will get it. For a tiny fee and the price of the food they will have amazing meals for you! Much cheaper than eating out every night! It was convenient for me as I could put my kids to bed after and not worry they would get tired. It was my dads birthday here and suci made it easy for us to get a cake! üòÅ

There is a gardener every morning to make sure the pool and grounds are nice and clean, he is very quiet and respectful but a lovely man.

There is a security guard named komang who became my children‚Äôs best friend! He took them to play at the beach every day at 6pm and would find crabs for them haha he is useful to have incase of an emergency or sickness! My daughter got sick at 10pm and within 20 minutes he had a doctor there for her üòÑ

Overall, don‚Äôt think about it, just book it!! üòç",Gorgeous villa. We arrived in the beginning of mango season. This is amazing because there is a huge mango tree in the front yard. The issue is this attracts flies. They were overwhelming until you get in the pool. Would definitely stay again. The staff is absolutely an A+,"Best choice ,when you like to visit around north bali and stay for a few days. Perfect place,service,breakfest and offcourse view souronding
Thanks üôèüôèüôè",Nice place. Friendly staff good service. Very recomended for your holiday in north of bali. Awesome place...........
