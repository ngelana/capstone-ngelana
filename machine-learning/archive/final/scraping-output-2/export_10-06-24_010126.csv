Had my doubts on the freshness given how short it took to get from kitchen to table, but as someone with a frozen shellfish allergy, I could tell it was fresh since I had no reactions after eating their grilled shrimp.

Though I imagine I wasn't dining during their peak times, I would still recommend this place for anyone wanting a decent Jimbaran seafood dinner, without having to travel all the way to South Kuta. Also happy that they serve Set Meals for individual diners, which was very convenient.

Great service, friendly and attentive wait staff, and plenty of parking for both cars and scooters.",One of the best seafood warungs in the. Area! We‚Äôre going back today for the 2th time
