But, the staff there were absolutely amazing, especially Angga who will go out of his way to help you and is extremely hard working and accommodating. As for the rooms, if you want to feel at one with nature, then go ahead. We are two girls scared of bugs however the rooms were clean and there are nets which make you feel safe from the bugs!! Recommend this for anyone wanting a relaxing get away and who has an open mind!!","Our stay here was perfect! If you‚Äôre looking for a getaway to the jungles of ubud you‚Äôve come to the right place! From the view of the jungle, the gorgeous swimming pool, the large bathtub (we did a flower bath which was incredible), the comfortable bed, and lovely staff, DD Ubud had everything. Definitely recommend for a relaxing getaway!",What a special place to be. This place is a definite must if you are coming up to Ubud why not go a stretch further and stay away from the hustle and bustle in a gorgeous luxurious villa right in the jungle. There is a stunning pool that overlooks the valley and the staff are so friendly and helpful. We rented a scooter from them and had the ability to come and go as we pleased. They bring all your food to your villa if you don't want to eat at their little restaurant. We loved it and extended our stay to rest and relax amongst the sounds of the jungle.,"Most beautiful place ever!!! So serene, clean rooms, comfortable beds, lovely and friendly staff. Always willing to help and service next to none. The staff had good recommendations of places nearby to visit and you can also hire a scooter from the villas. Literally in the jungle. The noises at night are so soothing.

The only thing I would say needs improvement is the restaurant. They need a few more fresh foods on the menu. I ordered a fresh salad and it came lathered in some sort of mayo. Some of the foods were way too salty. If they sort the kitchen out this place would be more than perfect! I didn't complain about the food and sure if I did they would have delivered something different.

Xx thanks for the amazing stay","We were just thinking about our encounter at the DD Jungle Villa back in 2017. The team was BEYOND friendly. It was my friends birthday and they arranged flowers, a cake and the crew surprised her with a birthday song. We still like to think about our stay at the lovely villa with the AMAZING team there. Thank you so much for the amazing experience!"
