We arrived early in the morning so we enjoyed the pool before a lot of people came. Food was generous and very delicious. Music was a perfect match to the beautiful outdoor view. We visited Cretya twice but will be more than happy to visit again, definitely worth it !","The place is beautiful, and there is a lot to do here. A lot of places for you take your pictures in. We also used the couples swing, which was a wonderful experience!!. This place is a must visit if you are ever in the Ubud area.
The staff here are also wonderfully polite, and will take good care of you. Thank you, Merry and the other wait staff for a wonderful experience!! We sure will visit again!","Incredible place! The architecture is gorgeous! If you get there early it's only 50k entrance and you can sit poolside on chairs and coffee tables or in the shared round seated area by the pool. The pool and changing rooms are free to use once you're there. There are nicer day beds that come with a minimum spend depending on location from 1,500,000 to 3,500,000 approx. This place would be amazing when a dj is playing. Definitely visit the terraces next door while you're there, it's included in the entrance fee. You can take your own pictures but you pay for the activities and dress hire. Worth doing in my opinion, it's hard to beat such a beautiful place!","Great vibe and cocktails, perfect place to chill for a few hours then go on a lovely walk around the grounds. I did the super extreme swing, a lot of fun with great shots taken by the photographer. The two guys who strapped me to the swing could've been a little friendlier but all the other staff members were a joy! Highly recommended visiting, but get here early!","A unique experience!!! The pool (3 different levels)  has an incredible view to the rice terrace!!! The service is excellent and the food tasteful!!! Literally, an amazing place to spend your day!!! As far the price there is an entry fee (50000k if I am not mistaken) after that you pay only your order."

My spouse enjoyed herself immensely on the swing, and the hospitality was excellent. We were sadly a little late, so we missed the best light-twilight photo opportunity. That was more than made up for, though, by the breathtaking vistas of the rice fields. If you're a nature lover looking for a peaceful getaway, this place is ideal.",AMAZING Place. Loved the pictures. Take as many as you like. Swings are great too. Fun swing rides with dresses to rent if needed. It rained a little- no so safe to walk around once it’s wet. Pick a sunny day for your visit 😃,This place is mind-blowing. What an amazing business model. This place is entirely made for ppl to come and click pictures. Everything is beautiful. The pools were my favourite part of the entire experience. The staff is sweet and the food is good. It was one of the best burgers i had. Highly recommend. Very well curated experience.,"This place is breathtaking! Be prepared with bathing suits and towels since they also have a pool area. It can be pricey though but there’s no other place in the world like this one. A lot of people come here but still, highly recommend you spend your day here. Motorbike parking it’s very close to it, you need to get entrance ticket and then get your belongings checked (backpack for example), no liquids or food allowed inside. For the ladies who want to take photos in the swings, you have to purchase tickets inside depending on the swing since they have many. Also be prepared since it can rain at any moment, it rained a lot today for like 2 hours.","It's a beautiful beautiful place that makes you realise how less you've seen once you see this. You can easily spend your whole day here eating, in the pool, roaming around picturesque landscape of rice fields. It's 🤌. I'd recommend you have Chicken Ramen here (and make sure that you don't let the fishcake fall in the broth, it makes the taste weird)"

Very nice spot with great atmosphere. Amazing sceneries and good facilities. Staff are very nice and friendly. Foods are good and reasonable price. No entry fee but there is a reasonable minimum expense. The only downside is that the locals would not let grab or go-jet to pick you up and the local taxi price is ridiculous, make sure to negotiate.",This was probably the best hotel rooms we ever stayed in. We actually had a 4 bedroom villa with pool and paddy field view. There was not much else around here to see but that was part of the attraction too. Located in a lush forest on the valley with infinity pools on 4 different levels. Staff are amazing.,"A very great villa resort in ubud area. The rooms are spacious, with private swimming pool and view of rice paddy field on the surroundings. It has a fully equipped kitchen and living room with big couch. The bedrooms are spacious, with a semi outdoor bathroom, and walk in closet. Had a very pleasant stay here","Our villa was amazing, service was exceptional and 24 hr room service really made this stay carefree. Loved being in the rice paddies and breakfast is an experience. We look forward to returning.","Been there on Feb. I have to say the staff was very helpful and responsive. By the moment we started communicate on WhatsApp months ago, the staffs would do anything they can assist .
The food was good. And the service was outstanding. The only drawback was the hygenity of the room. The ants crawled all over my bed at the first night. Also I felt the toilet was not clean enough.  There were some problems with the water supply from the faucets and shower. I guess that’s due to the infrastructure of Bali… otherwise everything’s good."

The views and deco …  truly mesmerising. What a beautiful place for lunch.

The service is warm and welcoming. Fast and speedy delivery of food, like they knew what we wanted :).

Please make a booking if you are coming in large groups (between 7-10) or have specific needs. The service crew is excellent!

The food is a combination of Asian and Western. A good selection of cocktails and alcoholic beverages.

We even had a solo artist serenade the restaurant while we had lunch.

Our service was ‘Gusde’ but I would surely spell this wrong. He was truly welcoming and patient to take all our orders.
Take time to walk around and capture those scenic moments!",Wardana was our host and receptionist. He was extremely polite and gave us some incredible recommendations. He knew his stuff! The food was delicious and came very fast. The signature local wine was surprisingly refreshing and matched the food very well. Recommend any traveller or local to try this place. All of the food has been photographed. 10/10.,"This restaurant was recommended to us by our local guide, and we were glad he did! The interior design is beautiful which pretty much enhanced the ambiance. Their food is great and service is excellent. What I like most is the fish pond which entertained our son and kept him busy while waiting for our orders. Surely, it is family and friendly restaurant to try.",I was very excited to recommend this place. View is really nice and place is cozy. I ate beef food. I can highly recommend to this food. Yoga is great waiter. He is very kind and fast. I could get proper information from him and very satisfied about his service. Thank you! Hope to see you again!,"We had a late at Tebasari on a Sunday around 2 pm and were seated immediately. Our driver recommended this restaurant for lunch - it has a beautiful view but I suspect this place is heavily geared towards tourists. Despite that, we enjoyed the food. I had the bebek tebasari which is breaded crispy duck and it was delicious! The duck was moist and flavorful and the outside of the duck was really crispy. I had it with a side of sauted veggies and it was perfect. We also had the pork ribs which were OK. Overall, this is a good lunch spot with beautiful views and a large menu. It's also very close to a coffee and tea tasting activity as well."

He was extremely knowledgeable and also very handy with a camera. He had us all smiling and learning about coffee, herbs and animals there. Highly recommend.","We attended on a Saturday around midday. It was very quiet and plenty of staff to show us around. The free tasters of coffee and tea were much appreciated.
The views were lovely.
Card facilities offered for purchases.","Discovered this place by accident and very glad that we did.
Free entry with amazing views and our guide Rani was very kind, we learnt a lot of facts from her.

The staffs are also very tentative and friendly, definitely would recommend this spot!","What is usually called a tourist trap with a nice story and a view. The shop sells overpriced stuff which they present as tea or coffee. Luwak coffee has nothing to talk home about. As for the sugar free mangosteen tea … turned out to be a sugary powder, with nothing natural to it and tasting very much like a cheap instant tea.","This is the must visit place in Bali especially when you visit ubud. Breathtaking rice terrace is very beautiful and calming. When you visit alas harum, you can taste luwak coffee in this cafe. There is also lots of coffee and tea choices. There is security check in the entrance, you don’t allowed to bring food/drinks from outside.","Free entry, coffee & tea sampler and tour of the luwak coffee process. Went early (8am I think) and light over the rice fields was gorgeous plus we had the place to ourselves!
