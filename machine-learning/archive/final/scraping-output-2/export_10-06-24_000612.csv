We‚Äôre staying at Bali Eco Stay and were on their ‚ÄòGreen Walk‚Äô trail when we passed by the coffee shop! The lady was waiting for us at the bottom of the stairs as we messaged ahead (but tbh I think she heard us walking down the road and came down to meet us). Sweetest lady and most stunning spot! Coffee is actually delicious too, we had 2 French presses and she ground the beans fresh for us (robusta beans they grow onsite).
Overall a heartwarming and serendipitous experience that left us smiling and bouncing through the rest of our walk and day.
Suksma! üôèüèæ","Support this little amazing place!
It is a little coffee and food place located in the middle of jungle and coffee fields. It is run by amazingly friendly woman, full of good energy and love. Super views!
Notify them in advance if you plan to come, they live nearby and will be very happy to prepare something for you! They are active on instagram @gempiniscoffee",Amazing spot with beautiful views and delicious food. Message them ahead of time to make sure someone is there. Definitely worth a visit!,"Bu ngurah is the best host imaginable. This little oasis of a coffeeshop is nestled amidst her own coffee plantation, while overlooking the beautiful batu karu mountain. The pisang goreng is top notch and the coffee is sublime. Something of a hidden treasure in these parts. Just make sure to contact before coming!","Wow such a lovely secluded spot with great food, great coffee and a romantic vibe! Owners are super friendly too. Toilets are clean. Menu is vegan. Can't recommend enough."
