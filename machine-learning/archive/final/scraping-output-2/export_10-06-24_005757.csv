Breakfast was amazing, but we came a bit late. Be there before 8am, so you can eat as there were a lot of empty plates at 9:20. So food finished and they didn‚Äôt bring any more.
We overslept and got there at 9:05. We still have nice food. However, don‚Äôt do our mistake and be there in time.
Around 9:25 they start taking animals back so you have to take your photos before.
We also fed elephants (u can buy food basket for 75k) and did lots of photos and videos. They are well looked after and some of them were rescued. Also 6 baby animals were born in this zoo ;)
Zoo is amazing. Lots of animals that I haven‚Äôt seen before in European zoos.
Must visit!","I loved this zoo and think it's well worth the visit, especially for children. Heaps to look at and fun activities for kids, like feeding the deer which are wandering freely. The tiger enclosure was too small but was told new expansion of the zoo will have larger enclosures. It is smallish so easy to get around and very interesting. Worth the visit üòÑ",Beautiful lush green surrounds. Can't believe you can usually ride a elephant if you are that way inclined. We walked in amongst some deer and little monkeys. That doesn't happen in Melbourne. What a treat. Well worth a visit kids or not.,"A solo trip to Bali Zoo and I was left in awe of how many different species they had. The staff were super friendly and helpful! I enjoyed seeing the meerkats up close and feeding them, that‚Äôs an experience I won‚Äôt soon forget. Can‚Äôt wait to come back when I visit Bali next :)","Very nice zoo. It is worth to go with kids and spend some time there. Food and drink all avaliable. All is kept very clean. Animals can move freely around.  Kids can feed animals, just being close as possible to the animals. The size of the zoo is perfect for kids. We love the place. Most of the walking paths are protected by trees, which makes it enjoyable
to walk around even during hot weather."

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Tlaga Singha River Club. We paid an entry fee which included a choice of 1 meal and Drink off the menu (cocktails were on the list) it also included towels. We sat in a hut over the water, we got to feed the fish, we had lunch which was absolutely delicious and the portions were big, the kids carbonara was incredibly yummy. Our son loved it.
We moved to the pool area were the staff organied us a table, it's so stunning and the staff are so helpful and friendly. We loved the pool on the below level and the Cocktails were to die for. Loved the view from the infinity pools. We Didn't get a cabana as we were in the pool and didn't need one.
I would recommend spending the day here. Our 8 year old absolutely loved it here as much as we did.",Gorgeous place! The water was a bit smelly but didn‚Äôt matter much. The food & drinks were delicious! I loved how the help my suitcase & kept it safe in a locked away room behind the reception.,"Typical tourist money trap. Our friends wanted to go so we went along to check it out. Although the pool is gorgeous, it's expensive and not worth it in my personal opinion.

It's minimum 200 000 to get in - which includes a towel, locker and a drink (juice, wine, beer or choice between two cocktails.)

300 000 will get you a wider range of cocktails to choose from and lunch. We got the nachos and a cheeseburger (Neither of them particularly exciting or flavourful. Very bland.)
Cocktails are alright, but they are the same as everywhere else.

If you want more comfort than a normal chair -  such as a beach chair between swims, you'll have to pay more.
If you want comfort AND shade be ready to pay even more (at least 500 000 for a cabana.)

Not allowed to bring any outside food or drinks, so you can't bring water or snacks. Everything has to be bought inside.

The staff was friendly and nice enough, but to be honest, we would have been better off staying at the hotel.","The whole place is magnificent! From their food to their staff, they are excellent! We had Wahyuni as our servicing staff and she is fabulous. Well worth the visit and experience!  Must visit in Singha Padu   in Bali!","Tlaga Singha was one of the biggest surprises during our stay in Bali. The team was very helpful with last-minute booking, was well informed about their 6pm swimming pool policy, as I have booked bed for 4pm. The place is stunning, swimmingpools are beautiful, and below pool and the roof is just wow. We had a great stay, it's  a gem in Ubud. Totally recommend."

Also got a complimentary photo shoot with edited pic. Room and vicinity were very clean. Staffs were friendly n helpful. Easy to get grab service to and from hotel. They also provide shuttle to town. Overall a pleasant stay.,"SancToo is the one of my family‚Äôs favorite place to stay.

Wonderful lovely service at restaurant since arrived thru breakfast in the morning, delicious breakfast given.
Thanks to whole of management for your consistency to always make my family holiday are superb memorable.
Recommend place to stay for holiday.

Thanks","One of the best hotel I experienced. Amazing location and the service is simply top notch‚Ä¶. If you are after a nature break, easy access to the zoo, feel like you are in the jungle with great spa and facilities to relax, look no further.","We booked a night at the resort to relax and unwind in the serenity as advertised.

Unfortunately there was a staff party for 4 hours of our 1 day stay which echoed around the resort for the full afternoon. Of course events are important but to charge a premium rate in a spa and give no prior warning I feel is a very poor customer experience. Response from the resort was, don't complain, this is how is.

Beautiful hotel, location etc but be warned your stay may be interrupted by loud noise without warning - which is not what a luxury spa would be."

If you are interested in such ornaments, it‚Äôs great to stop by here.","The wood carvings at Mammoth are incredible. From the small to the incredibly large. We purchased a painted Barong carving to remind us of the captivating, traditional Balinese Barong play.","Enjoy the history of the wood carving in Bali. This place is run by families of wood carvers. Couldn't buy anything though, they sell in USD fyi. But you can watch and appreciate all their work for free. Some of their life size figures are so realistic that you'd be surprised when you first see them. The attention to detail is top class and no item is ever the same, so whatever you get here will surely be unique. They had geckos,dogs, cats, eagles, komodo dragons and horses even jaguars. Bali wood is a good souvenir and it changes color over time(from green to light greyish).","If you're looking for wood carvings from small to very large statement pieces, this is the place to go.

Try the local wine, I was pleasantly surprised. Agung Rai, the chef came and spoke to us at the end of the night to check we enjoyed our meal and spoke to us about what else we can do while we are in Bali.

Thank you all","Just had a perfect dinner last night at this restaurant. All foods are great! (I even ordered a Tom Yum, which considered as a ""tricky dish"", but I could say that was one of the best Tom Yum that I'd ever eat in a non-Thai restaurant.)

The night ambience and vibes were cozy and the live music brought by Bli Agung Purwa (IG: agunggdepurwa) was top notch! Eventho it was only an acoustic session, the choice of songs, his voice & guitar strings - he was killin it!! Sanctoo needs to make him as a regular performer there.

No need to leave the hotel and search for foods in surrounding area if this hotel have a plenty of superb foods! Great job Sanctoo Restaurant!","The restaurant was actually next to Bali Zoo (I think its part of the Bali Zoo) whereby part of the villa resorts. Good place for family to stay and out and about to the zoo whilst you stay there. The foods were OK, nothing special.. although the service in the beginning was great but when there are many costumers around, they started to struggle to serve each table."
