It is a big hotel and good for non vegetarian but VERY BAD for vegetarian since breakfast menu is not including anything vegetarian other than salad. Rooms are very spacious and net. Hotel property is also neat n clean. Pool was not at all clean. We booked pool view room so it was a good view too. Overall stay is good but not good for food since they don‚Äôt have kitchen to provide lunch or dinner.,"Small old rooms. Smelly dirty bathroom and dirty towels (floor towel looks more whithe than shower towels). No have soap and cotton buttons, no shower cap. When was booking - on picture  was room with balcony,  but in real  no balcony...
PS The worst breakfast i had on Bali in such hotel's prices ranges...",It's a budget Hotel with good amenities. Bit far from the centre of the city but a quiet place. For vegetarians its a BIG NO since they don't offer options for vegetarians. Also they don't have lunch or dinner ala carte options. Only breakfast is available. We were satisfied with the room since we took pool view room and rooms were very clean,"Hotel somehow a bit away from the beach and bars. But quiet, affordable, great staff and pleasant rooms. All kind of facilities. But you need transport (or take a long walk) for to get away. Sunset food court and sunset road with a lot of restaurants in reach.","First of all it's not a 4 star hotel, it's like a 3 star with stingy amenities and facilities.

However, I found the bathroom to be quite large, although it became extremely slippery when wet, which was a bit concerning.

The service at the hotel was excellent, with the front desk staff and other employees being very friendly and helpful throughout my stay.

One highlight was the breakfast, which was delicious and catered to my taste. Overall, I had a great stay and would recommend this hotel to others.

This hotel quite near with kuta beach","Nice hotel, worth the price!
Cleanliness is the key of a hotel, and they did it.
They also have nice staff üëåüèª
But the only give you bath towel, if you used to use a separate towel for face and hand, you need to ask first.
And they even asked us to review, it means that they care to do improvements. üëçüèª
Please maintain it.","As you can see on the video, the room looks quite old. There's a problem with their water, luckily it's happening on our last hours before checking out, when we call the receptionist, they quickly fixing the water problem, however the water that came out after fixing is totally black (don't now whether it's a sewage water or not). Bathroom door is made from wood so overtime it's getting moldy and the exhaust fan is noisy so you need to close the bathroom door perfectly. Air conditioner isn't too cool, but the room temperature luckily still bearable. When I asked for second keycard they ask deposit of a hundred thousand rupiah (I do the same at other hotel and the other hotel didn't require any money deposit, so it's kinda faze me). Hopefully they do some repairs and update, so there're no more disappointments in the future.","We got free upgrade room from Deluxe to Grand Deluxe when checked in coz our room type was full. It has bathtub and balcony and our kid is super happy. The room is clean, all staffs are nice. The hotel is in good location, just 10 min to Kuta, 18-20 min to Seminyak.

Very nice breakfast with so much variety & delicious food...

Just surprised in the day 2 that they said my 7 years kid got charge Rp 50.000 for breakfast. Yesterday they just let my kid and not tell anything... Little bit dissapointed why didn't inform in the first day, but if this the condition for kids then I accept it. So far it's a quite nice experience stay in this hotel.","Easily the worst experience I've been having in bali.

We were given the room at the end of the corridor and the AC was not working, the floor was oily, the bathroom looked dirty. We called the receptionist and they sent technician. But it seemed that the technician knew that the AC was troublesome and they arranged for a replacement room.

The replacement room was better, the AC was working though it was not cool enough, the floor was not oily, but the bathroom was as dirty as the previous one. Also, the running water was weak and not satisfying.

The breakfast was really far from okay, it was not tasty at all.

We initially booked for two night but we surendered the second night and did early check out because we could not stand and was not having a good feeling with the property.

They seemed to be understaffed as well, we did not received a greeting when we arrive, we barely see security staffs in front of the hotel. When checking out, we ordered a bellman. The bellman was happened to be the receptionist too and helped me to load our lugages to our vehicle.

The leftover feeding utensils from the other guests was seen stacking in front of the room since we checked in and was not cleaned until the next day when their house keeping staffs were making up the rooms. That looked disgusting.

Definitely will not consider to stay here and wont recommend to anyone else either."

Rooms are an excellent size & clean. The balcony I had was a very good size as well with the sound of the water features by the pool.  The grounds were lovely with a couple ponds with fish and a couple of turtles.  I only went to the restaurant for a couple of breakfasts which was nice.  They cater for a lot of different tastes and it had a lovely atmosphere in there.  The only downsides were that they sometimes have school trips there and the children are very noisy, running up and down the corridors, knocking on doors and running off.  This only happened on a few of the nights that I was there and it was not really the hotel's fault.","The building and services of this hotel is most similar to a 2 star motel not as a 4 star hotel.
Breakfast quality and quantity was the worst.
It doesn't look like a 4 stars hotel for it's breakfast as they serve minimum variety of foods and most of the time the supplied dishes were empty
Stained sheets and pillows, even though we asked them to change them, they still weren't as clean as they should be..
During our one week stay, two groups of about 300 high school students stayed in the hotel, causing noise early in the morning and until midnight, they would disturb other guests and there were about 6 to 8 students staying in each two or four-bedrooms, and during breakfast, we had to wait until 8:30 for the students to leave the breakfast area, so that the table would be available for other guests, and after that, usually the food containers were empty or half.
I give them one star just because of their staff as they tried their best efforts to service the guest.","An average 3 star hotel. Free breakfast is available in the restaurant. Menu is rather limited. Staff is friendly and courteous but the maintenance of the rooms needs to be upgraded. During my stay, the AC had to be checked by the technician daily to keep it running. Toilet needed better cleaning. A small bottle of water is provided for each guest daily which is highly inadequate.",The room is very clean and well maintained.The staff there is very friendly. The hotel gives the feel of natural vibe. The buffy Breakfast there is very nice .This hotel is very comfortable for the family.,I could live with the roaches in the room if the front desk staff was properly trained to make their guests happy so the  guests would want to come back - the core of a successful hospitality establishment.

The room is quite spacious and they even have a sofa so you can communicate in group or play game together with other friends.

Food:
The food actually is quite delicious and their drink also not bad

Price:
The price is actually not that pricey and the location is in center so it was good enough

The most important thing note:
1. There are a bar just beside the hotel and they have live music till 3 AM, so for those who can‚Äôt disturb by sound i really not recommend coming here. The sound is quite big and clearly for me i kinda don‚Äôt mind but just to be safe i really not recommend
2. The bathroom floor is so slippery so truly take a note for this especially for elderly. Because when you take a bath you can easily fall down. Safety come first
3. The service is actually not bad but just a small detail is that when we ask for plastic bag they literally don‚Äôt have one at all actually this is not important lol but just for note only

Overall i kinda okay to give 4 star but for others who needs more details i decided to give 3 star, the reason because of the live music and the slippery floor that is kinda dangerous.","Affordable hotel in the center of Kuta. The also have family rooms for 4 persons.
The rooms is quite clean, but the we still can hear the noise outside the room.
The location is very strategic where there is lots of street food.","We stayed here for one night in May 2023. The hotel was nice; the room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. The staff was also nice and helpful. The downside of this hotel is its location next to a club. There was loud live music until 3 am on a weekday. We couldn't sleep, and the vibration from the music made it worse. We called the receptionist; he apologized and said the music would stop around 3 am. I had read reviews about the loud music before, but I didn't think it could be that bad.

There was something weird about the water in this hotel as well. It made our skin feel soapy, and the floor was slippery. I thought it might be the hotel's soap, but it wasn't. I tried with my own soap and shampoo; it still made my skin feel soapy. It felt like we couldn't rinse it cleanly.","This place is absolutely   stunning, great staff amazing  service, good food, rooms are nice and the pool/lounger is beautiful  and really clean. If you come to Bali definitely chose this hotel bloo  amazing stunning staff.  The location is really good to all the good shopping places are nearby. The main thing that is absolutely  amazing  that the staff are very nice and friendly.","Value for money. I'm currently staying on my fourth night here. Booked a family room and very impressed with the room. Everything is great, clean, and well maintained. I stay in a spacious room with ample facilities (it has mini fridge & a safe), 2 queen beds, AC works well, bathroom is superb, clean & puffy towels, & wifi is okay. The only downside is the live music noises from surrounding cafe(s)? The music is super loud that makes the glass windows vibrating. I can't sleep until 2-3 AM and it's really stressful. It's a perfect hotel if you are in budget and need to stay near the city center. Great for party goers or family with young adult/teenager. But, not really recommended for family with babies or toddlers, since they might find it hard to sleep. Please do something with the nearby cafe(s)' noises :("

We reported it to the staff (they're super nice btw) and they offers us a room with a cold and functioning AC. The service is nice around here.,"When I stayed there, the hotel was in the maintaining process. Anyway, I had satisfying experiences to stay here. They have good concierges, nice pool, and strategic location (it's near the airport)","Lacking of staffs, but the available staffs were helpful. Facilities‚Äô standard were shocking. Elevators are out of service, which apparently is an ongoing issue since the hotel opened. Rooms were lacking items, such as mini fridge, iron, etc.. We booked a room with pool access, however the pool weren‚Äôt accessible, due to maintenance, and we were only informed when we checked in. No compensation offered as well. Quite dissatisfied and disappointed."

Amazing Family Dinner at Bali Nikmat!

We had a wonderful family dinner at Bali Nikmat Chinese Restaurant last night and couldn't wait to share our experience! The food was absolutely delicious - everything we ordered was fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. It was clear that high-quality ingredients were used, and the portions were generous.

The atmosphere at Bali Nikmat was also fantastic. The restaurant was clean and inviting, and the staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. They were happy to answer our questions about the menu and made sure we had everything we needed for a great dining experience.

We especially enjoyed the fish and beef , it was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. The , noodles were also a highlight, and we all loved trying different dishes from the menu.

Overall, Bali Nikmat Chinese Restaurant was an excellent choice for our family dinner. The delicious food, friendly service, and inviting atmosphere made for a truly enjoyable evening. We highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Chinese dining experience in Bali.","Bali Nikmat offers a delightful dining experience with its renowned Chinese cuisine, crafted by a skilled Hong Kong chef. During my visit, I enjoyed fried noodles, a mix platter of appetizers, tofu sapo, and steamed fish in soy sauce (Hong Kong style). The mix platter and steamed fish were the highlights, showcasing exceptional flavors and surprising affordability compared to similar restaurants.

The service was quick and friendly, enhancing the overall experience. The atmosphere was reminiscent of an authentic Hong Kong restaurant, with a clean and neat environment. Bali Nikmat stands out for its delicious dishes, excellent service, and inviting ambiance, making it a must-visit for Chinese food lovers.",The food tastes so good. It was very crowded during dinner time. there‚Äôs no waiting-list and people jump the queue! so it was a bit chaos during our visit.,"Good indo-chino seafood. Def has the elements of a Chinese restaurant with a bali twist. Classic dishes are pretty close, and the variety is appreciated. Good serving staff who are responsive in both Chinese and English to a reasonable extent","We ordered a few dishes to try, including the signature salted egg crab, Hong Kong steam fish, and a few other dishes.

Foods 4/5 ‚Äî The crab was a bit dry unfortunately but the other dishes were pretty good.

I‚Äôd recommend the Ikan Tim ala Hongkong, Sapo Tahu, and Cumi Goreng Cabe Garam.

Service was great, staff was attentive to our needs.

Plenty of parking in front of restaurant."

I checked out the hotel 3 hours after check-in, disgusting I could say.

The receptionist clicks a selfie  and makes us wait during the check-in process.

The room isn't well maintain and not clean, saw many hair everywhere, dirty mug, dirty kettle.

Locked in the bathroom twice, they said it's my fault that I don't understand how to open it, it's clear that the handle is broken. Everything is dirty and the whole vibe of the hotel is wrong.

Some young people sitting in front of the room drink alcohol, they smoke at the reception area, everywhere.

It's like a gangster hotel, please avoid this place, especially when you travel with kids, the window setup is very dangerous.

Awful experience for 350K","Comfortable, the Wi-Fi is abit annoying because it's slow and oftentimes disconnect on itself. The pool is clean and bug enough, the shower automatically adjust to warm water, and the air conditioning is cold.
The hotel is located on sunset road so it's easy to go everywhere else nearby.",Great location.  Nice pool.  Polite staff,We were asking the housekeeping staff for clean pillows for three days and they would give us dirty ones (picture added). When we asked then why they said the owner does not want to buy clean pillows or cleaning product to clean them. A bunch of bs. The hotel is dirty overall and run down. And the staff most of the time they spend listening to music in the reception and chit chatting without actual help. When we asked them to give us a fork they said to bring our own kitchenware cause ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt have access to the kitchen‚Äù And the cherry on top cockroaches near the pool. Not recommended.,Good hospitality and service at a prime location close to the beach and airport.

My favorit soup are kuro premium and spicy tonkostu ramen, the taste of the broth is light, rich and tasty. If you don't eat pork, don't worry ! They have chicken & vegan ramen option.
One must order is gyoza sambal matah !","First time at this spot and it blew our taste buds away!

Tried Tonkotsu Ramen AKA, Chicken Ramen AKA and the Spicy Karaage Chicken ‚Äì each dish was a flavor explosion! ü§åüèæ

The broth was a perfect balance ‚Äì not too thick, but bursting with richness.

Can't wait to be back for more!","Been here many times.
I recommend Tam Tam extra Spicy Chicken but change the chicken into grill slice chicken instead of their original ground chicken
(no additional fee will be added for changing the chicken type).
Their chicken gyoza and chicken katsu is worth to try.
Sometimes need to queue due to theres not enough sitting space.",Ramen was super tasty the only downside were the thin spicy noodles they had a strange chewy texture. Sambal dumplings were awesome and fresh tasting.

Why?

1. The cleaner stole my jacket and some of my other mate's stuff. You'd think that at the very least they cleaned the place up, right? But no. They didn't. Its EXACTLY the same as before you left it.

2. The room is even worser than my school's warehouse. Like, The light's broken, multiple brown stains on the bed and the tv, sunflower seeds inside the closet (which is also on life support), and they didnt even sweep the floor. Avoid using the towel and soap/shampoo at all costs, cause there is NO way they took the time clean/change it.

3. Dont even bother trying to connect to the wifi, they dont have one.

Conclusion? Sleep in the car.",Hotel located at horrible place there is no crowd around hotel inside also look like horrible n so scary inside the hotel at stairs there is no light everywhere is darken bad food with bad smell charger point also not available in lobby restaurant also close for dinning they r not providing lunch or dinner in breakfast they only give 1 black container in that bad smelly breakfast i dont recommend ths hotel to any 1 even they dont even change bed sheet daily we stayed there for 3 days but they never change bed sheet....üòë,"This place has it's glory days before but not nowadays. Used to be a great spot for good accomodation in Kuta area. If you're looking for comfortable stay, STOP! Don't even consider this place. The rooms has plenty of molding inside (see attached photos) not healthy, this hotel don't have phone from room to room and/or to front desk (they give you WhatsApp number for person incharge to handle your usual orders), No Wi-Fi available except only at the lobby area, There are no breakfast available, Hot showers only available when the sun is shining (you can't have hot showers in night time), This hotel only provide 1 towel per room (2nd towel provided when asked), There's no amenities kit, No Shampoo...they only provide 1 bottle of liquid bath soap, The elevator can only carry around 2-3 persons and the level 1 button is broken (see attached photos), The fire/smoke detector inside the room I've stayed is hanging by it's cable (accident hazard). There is no extra key cards for all the guest even when we want to deposit money to get extra key card..there's none. Built in AC controller on the wall in my room showing weird indicator number (it shows 67) it's working but not the best, it's buttons are wonky and loose. Lucky they still has good beds and sheets but the pillows sheets are a little suspiciously dirty, Too little number of staff incharge. I think this hotel was impacted by the pandemic and they're trying to stay alive until now but they sacrifice their services and guest's comfort. I've had bad experience with this hotel. Book and stay here at your own risk. May Serela Kuta has long live ahead. Suksme!","I had nothing less than a great stay here. The rooms are very spacey, the bed is comfy and really huge in size, the bathrooms are extraordinary good (mine even had a bathtub). You'll find everything you need close by (Food court, laundry, supermarket). Location-wise it's located neatly, so that you won't drive too long to your desired destination. The staff is super friendly, help you out with destination advice, if needed, and the reception is manned 24/7.

I'll definitely come back here! ‚ù§Ô∏è","Good people run this place. Staffs are really nice, except the bellboy (or security, I'm not sure) not helpful at all. Not many facility but with price like this, it's worth it. The location is a bit far to walk anywhere but still manageable. Nearby Bali bakery, we love it. Breakfast is so so, they're not good at making soup dishes, taste like salt water."

3. Room: Rooms are quite spacious with some rooms facing the pool area.

4. Facilities & Service: The staff is also quite helpful if guests need help. They also need more parking to accommodate guest vehicles.",Staff was very good. Hotel was far away from beachside. Room space was good. Swimming was very small but was taste was slightly not satisfactory. Overall experience was 4 star out of 5. I had room in the front of swimming pool at ground floor. Moreover the staff was very educated and well behaved.,"Was a good stay here ... polite and friendly staffs. Actually I stayed here on two different nights on two different rooms. The first night the room I got was perfect and the totally amazing.

The room I got on the second day was not so impressive and the AC was not working as expected. The food here is cheap and I like it very much. Especially the Nasi Goreng is worth the money. I really really loved it. There is a shopping mart opposite to this place and many cheap and good eateries around this hotel. It's really recommended for every backpacker and bachelors planning. And yes ofcourse for the family which is planning on a budget trip.

Pool was clean and well maintained !!!"

Some of my orders need more time to make.
But based on my experience here, i might think there's some sushi that is not really fresh. I can't tell you which one is the menu that is not fresh cause i ordered some.","The place is great. Spacious parking lot and nice staff. However, the chair at the sushi bar is not ergonomic at all. It is too low for the table. The sushi is nice and quite affordable, but I don't really prefer the karaage and the dessert.","Have visited this place multiple times. On every visit i've always experienced good service.
Most times their food are good and worth their price, but once or twice, minor errors happens, like too much or too little seasonings which i'm still fine with.
During busy hours especially weekends tend to be very full.
During peak hours can be a little noisy too since it's fully packed.
Great place for large groups."
