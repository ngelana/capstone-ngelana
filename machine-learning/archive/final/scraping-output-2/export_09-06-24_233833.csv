ChIJYbfvbK4h0i0R4hWJY37EpUk,Adiwana Dara Ayu,-8.361470599999999,115.2437193,"JL. Raya Buahan, No. 88X, Majangan, Buahan Kaja, Kec. Payangan, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80572, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=5306863783040849378,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 9000797,hotel,"hotel, resort_hotel, lodging",4.4,269,,"We booked a room for two nights which included 2x massages, 2x afternoon tea, 2x breakfast and turn down service. They never gave us the massages and only gave us one afternoon tea after we asked for it. The driver who picked us up from the airport recommended us a different driver to return to Seminyak. The driver he recommended arrived to the hotel late, asked for more money than was agreed because he said the trip would take longer than 5 hours. We agreed. The trip took 4.5 hours so we paid him the original price and he started swearing at us and nearly got violent.

The location of this hotel is stunning, but we are severely unimpressed. Was not worth the money or hassle.",This place is just heaven.  Without a doubt the most beautiful place I've ever been to.. staff are second to none they just can't do enough for you .,"Beautifully located and nestled in lush nature with astonishing view into the greens of rice fields - all with a jungle feelingâ€¦ BUT the hotel needs an update - as wooden floors on the outside area are rotten, we found broken tiles at the pool area and the overall condition of amenities is poor (ie restrooms). In this price category in Bali other resorts do far better. In this respect Adiwana Dara Ayu might lose clients fast and soon - even though potential is enormous due to location.

Cleanliness :(
Especially cleanliness was not satisfying - windows and mirrors were smudged, curtains and ceiling fan dirty and the mosquito net was neither clean nor in proper condition - there were holes and wordt of all: poop stains visible (yes, geckos and lizards poop on the nets because they also live in the villas - which is rather normal â€¦ - but poop stains is a no-go. We also asked housekeeping to change our net because there was fresh poop on it, however housekeeping just did a bit of cleaning - not too well - and did not exchange the net :/). also pillows for sunbeds were dirty, the towels for the pool area were in very very poor condition (bleached out, holes), the decorative table mats at breakfast and dinner showed mold, cups at breakfast had stainsâ€¦ we also found several dead animals (frogs, snakes, fish) in the various ponds (which were removed after two days). All in all we did not feel too comfortable because of missing the â€šclean-feelâ€˜.

What also should be improved is work on privacy protection - as bathrooms are outdoors, guests desire to have some privacy. From the balcony of our room we were able to see straight to the neighbouring villas pot - also sight protection in our bathroom could have been managed better (self-made bamboo mats/ palm leaf mats were installed, but were not well attached due to weather conditions).

Communication & Service :/
The telephone in our villa was broken, thus we were not able to communicate with front desk - after we told staff about it, the telephone was removed and not replacedâ€¦ overall communication with staff was difficult due to language issues and (non-)availability - best time to get in touch with someone was during breakfast. Despite two staff members we had the feeling that people were not very ambitious and engaged.

Upon arrival (we arrived 7-ish pm) we had to register online, there was no explanation of anything - neither times for breakfast nor anything else on the resort - but there was also no folder or information available at the roomâ€¦.

When we needed service concerning transportation, staff was very helpful - costs for transportation in comparison to other places we have been to are touristy but ok-ish.

Food:
Food is ok, kitchen chef is very lovely and ambitious on local dishes - however this is not a place for high expectations on food or anything fancy. Temperature on dishes was low - â€šsauce hollandaiseâ€™ on egg benedict need big improvement - or stick with local dishes! I have to admit that I am very picky on food, thus this review might come harshâ€¦

Overall:
In the condition the hotel is now it is not worth the money spent. Some quick fixes, overall price reductions might help until restauration is finished.","review of buffet breakfast only! 5 stars for the view. The buffet is pricey so sit and enjoy the unlimited coffee tea and fresh juices and look out to the jungle. Breathtaking honestly had two coffees so I had an excuse to stay longer.

3/4 stars Food - it is normal, nothing spectacular but the service is top notch they are very kind and attentive. Buffet came with toast and croissant and another pastry.

6 stars service - when I had my moto accident this place helped clean my wounds and bandaged me up.

i dont even stay here! and they were nice to me. Shout out to Su!

if you are lucky you might catch the sunrise on a clear day

also this place is 45 min by moto do not stay here if you easily get cabin fever it is far from ubud center.","the location was amazing in terms of a nice peaceful get away, isolated from the busy roads. only complaint was that the rooms got quickly infested with ants as the doors werenâ€™t flushed to the wall."

I donâ€™t want to be rude but thatâ€™s the truth. Poorly there are no alternatives in the area so as a guest of the hotel you are kind of forced to eat there.
First we noted that the prices on the menu are much higher than the prices that are shown in the room while there are still the same dishes. Also I was really annoyed to see that there are barely no vegan or vegetarian meals on the card. At least it was possible to change chicken to tofu for the curry. The curry itself was not creamy at all, more like a soup. It was okay but not worth the price. The pizza is the most disgusting dish I ever experienced in a restaurant. It was basically just really thin dough with a ton of ketchup. Luckily the portion was quite small so we had bad feeling when we decided that we wonâ€™t eat it. All in all this dinner was the most expensive one we had during our Bali trip but the worst. While we waited for the food we also heard the noise of the microwave all the time.
I would really not recommend to eat here. If you are staying in the hotel just order food via the grab app. You have to pay a delivery fee when food is delivered from Ubud but still you end up paying less than in this restaurant and you get a way nicer meal.","Great restaurant located at Payangan street.
