Additionally, they had a dedicated team of staff members who were ready to capture your moments at every location. What's more, there was a helpful lady in the dressing room who assisted me in styling the rental dress to my liking. The absence of long lines made the experience even more enjoyable, and I can confidently say that every penny spent was well worth it.The photos taken at this place turned out to be some of my absolute favorites from the entire trip, and I have absolutely no regrets about choosing to visit this location. The convenience of having all the attractions included in one ticket, the professional staff members ready to capture memories, and the assistance provided in the dressing room all contributed to making this experience truly unforgettable. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to create lasting memories in a hassle-free environment.","Great location for pictures and amazing staff. I went on a weekday around 10:30am

The price seems hefty for a photo spot, but they have so many staff around to ensure you‚Äôre safe, not waiting too long as they guide to different spots and each spot has someone attending to it so the price makes sense.
They really make an effort to take the best pictures/videos and are so kind! If you‚Äôre not into taking photos, there‚Äôs nothing else here for you.

You also get a welcome drink.

No queue for entry, but about 5min wait for some picture spots. There was about 8+ photo spots and 3 swings. 1 swing is really big and fast.","This place is amazing.
The staff are welcoming and friendly, and the whole place is incredibly organised.
If you're scared of heights, then this may not be your favourite place. However, there were plenty of options for photos and videos without getting on the swings, so it really does cater for all.
The views are absolutely stunning, and included in the cheap entry fee, is lunch, which was very tasty indeed, and there was lots to choose from.
The restaurant there also caters to those who wish to buy their lunch separately, and there is a good selection of food, drinks, sweets, and ice creams.
This place was easy to get to by car and very reasonably priced.
I am really looking forward to returning here again, and I would highly recommend it for all ages.","This place had slightly higher admission and dress rental prices than others because you buy one ticket for full access to all nests/swings/photo attractions, and they have a complete set of staff to take your photos at each site. They even had a lady in the dressing room to help me style my rental dress however I would like it. No lines, and WELL worth the money! These are some of my favorite photos from the trip and I have zero regrets!!","True HEAVEN. We were accompanied by cacink through the entire tour. He took amazing photos and videos with his phone. Truly unbelievable service. If you ever visit here, ask for him. You will not be disappointed. The dresses are available for rent for an extra cost, worth it for the photos"

No crowd, way cheaper, BEAUTIFUL views, and incredible staff. They took a million photos, gave us guidance on poses, and made the experience so much fun. I would highly recommend this place !!",Amazing view with all kinds of settings üòç Love that the crews were so helpful with your poses and dress! Definitely recommend to rent the dress as well ü´∂üèª 10/10 experience,"Amazing experience, Dewi satyahati very calm and sweet we love her hospitality such a nice and kind person. Guys as per my personal experience visit this place for all the swings adventure in Ubud, bali you won‚Äôt regret.

Wonderful time üëçü•≥","A small tip before the review- For all swings and nest, they will charge you 450K IDR per person, but if you choose to book (at spot or in advance) from Klook the same will cost you only 217K IDR. Irrespective of your medium of booking, if you want dress for ladies/girls, it is going to cost you 200K per person and personal photographer with DSLR camera will cost you another 200K. Not only that, for taking photo at the Temple Gate/Door structure they have built on the premises is again chargeble at 100K per person.
Pros: 1. There wasn't any waiting as it was very less crowded. Hardly 10 couples were there. Your time will be utilized effectively.
2. The staff at the swings were joyful, friendly and helpful in taking photos with phone. They know the tricks and do it well. ü§´
3. When we reached it was raining, hence the office staff advised to wait for the rain to stop before making the payment/booking.

Cons: 1. The area they have is very limited
2. A bit aged lady (appeared as the owner) was there who didn't seem to be very customer friendly.
3. Their washrooms need cleaning",at first a little pessimistic and it was ultimately a great time as the people who work there do everything possible to provide you with the best photos possible! superb spot I recommend!

Poor animals were sleeping together in a corner of the cage, probably terrified. People who buy this coffee just because is cool should think twice  before doing so. Businesses like this should be investigated and fined for how they treat animals.","The rafting track is beautiful and the prices are good after negotiation, but the swings are overpriced, so you have to negotiate the price if you want to try it.","Cliff side day club with infinity pool overlooking ayung river  valley. Food, service and view way better than its sister club that have the same name around saba bali","The concept is terrific, the food and beverage was commendable, the swimming pool is nice. However, maintenance seems neglected, the place need to be tidied up a lot especially the facilities like toilet and changing room. The music's beat also often not in harmony with the supposed to be zen atmosphere. Overally an interesting getaways, alone or with loved ones. After a tidy up and maintenance, this place will be terrific.",Best place for Bali swing..... Awesome staff.... We really had a great time.....

When I went, I was the only person there.  They didn't have dogs there, because of Coronavirus....bummer!   I had pizza...it was okay... nothing special.  When I got the bill they charged me an extra 50,000 entrance fee.   I was not happy about that!  I don't mind paying, but I didn't like being charged when I'm about to leave.  I saw no sign and they didn't ask me or inform me of the entrance fee.  Greeters should ask for fee or tell you of the fee when you first walk in.   They have some nice swings.  They wanted 300,000 for the swing, so declined.   I can find other swings for a much lower price, especially during the pandemic."

To go here only takes 15 - 20 minutes from Ubud. Through beautiful rural roads.

Staff , Very professional in taking videos & photos

Food, very delicious, especially the grilled ribs and duck.

The place is flat, making it easier for you to access every swing and sports photo. For those of you who want to come here, don't ever hesitate. No need to queue and no need to hesitate anymore.

Note ; This place can be booked to have dinner with your friends, if you have an event planned.

The full moon is the most beautiful point in this place. Hopefully this review is useful for you.",Best jungle swing in bali,Cool place to get amazing experience,Excellent experience,"Best place for taking photos.

But there are lots of other places for Bali swing.

The main issue we faced was the food.  Food was included but we didn't take that since there are no Indian food.  So we requested them to provide at least 2 coconuts for the replacement of Lunch.  But they charged us 60k for that and that was not acceptable.

So better Please check other locations,  before you select here.."
