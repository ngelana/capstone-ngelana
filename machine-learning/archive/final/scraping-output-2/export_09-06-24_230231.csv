I stopped in for an early breakfast.
Fantastic view out the back inside a very nice minimalistic decorated cafe. The Mee Goreng was well seasoned and delicious. Both my Iced Latte and refreshing Ginger Beer were also perfect.
The staff are also super attentive and friendly. I was immediately greeted and seated with a smile. Drinks and meal were served within minutes.
I can highly recommend the House of Tundra to any one passing by or staying in the area.","Great dinner experience while the mist rolls in; good food makes for a good mood. üòÅ The waiters are also helpful and very friendly to customers. Unfortunately, we were the last order because the restaurant closes before 9 pm. We'll definitely be back next time we visit Bedugul.

P.S. Their wonton soup is on another level. It's perfect for warming your body and soul when you‚Äôre feeling cold due to the weather.
ü•∞","pretty good. tahu and wonton soup were very good, eggplant katsu was tasteless. lemongrass tea also solid. impressive setup, decor and architecture for the location; def the nicest place in the area and pops up out of nowhere either before bedugal/lakes or after, depending on the direction. menu looked expansive and prices reasonable. relaxing and good views. plenty of parking. staff well trained and helpful. exceeded expectations; def worth a stop, though the other review(s) that mentioned flies had a point‚Ä¶3 of them joined us for lunch ü§¢","every corner of this place is aesthetic, have a nice ambiance, cool air, spacious space, even the food in this place is all delicious for the price including standard

If you want to find a place that has cool air in Bali, you can come here","such a beautiful place!
big portions of tasty food

not so quick, but very nice anyway"

I stayed for a night with my partner, and it's super worth it. The ambience, the view, all feels like home. It also have a fascinating night view. The staff were so kind, i got a minor issue about the television but they help us right away.","If you have ever read reviews about poor soundproofing in the rooms, then know that you lived in a fortress. Because here you will be living right on the street. Despite the fact that it is a detached house you will hear absolutely everything that happens around. The evening will start with bikes passing all over the valley, will continue with a dog barking all night and will end with a rooster right under your ear, which runs somewhere in the neighboring village. Plus all the talking around, banging, buzzing, etc. The room itself is clean and nice, but there are nuances: firstly, it is very dark. Despite several lamps, it is still very dark in the evening. Secondly, there is a door between the bedroom and the bathroom, but it is transparent and without curtains! Third, inattention to the little things: inconvenient shampoo, far away from the bathtub, window facing directly into the wall, no air conditioner or fan.
The place is beautiful, stunning view, clean room and lovely bath. But unfortunately it is absolutely impossible to sleep and rest because of everything, absolutely everything is audible!","Wow. What a beautiful place?! Outstanding panorama and a beautiful, luxury room. The employees are very friendly. Me and my friend felt welcomed and comfortable.",We booked the hotel via Booking and we asked several questions prior to the arrival and did not get any answer. The staff did not speak any English at all. In our Booking it was included the breakfast but when we arrived there they said it was not included. Finally we got a basic breakfast. They did not help us with any transportation arrangement. Rooms were not really clean. I would not recommend to stay here.,"The 1 stars is only for kutot who serves the place .. she is very kind and welcoming.
Regarding the rooms :
We found our villa dark and smelly
The mattress has black spots on it (  it could be bed bugs traces or mold but i cant say which for sure)
The room was dusty and there were ants everywhere .. i was literally sleeping with ants ..
The villa is very noisy .. there is a roster  behind the place who doesn't let anyone to sleep .. plus noise from the road
Breakfast was poor
We checked out next morning we couldn't stay more"
