Photogenic boats with fishermen activities and young boys flying gigantic kites. A hidden gem for sure.,"At low tide, full moon or on holidays when the fishing boats do not go out to fish, the estuary of the Perancak river is full of beautifully decorated boats. The sun sets behind the opposite side of the river. Locals and tourists go to the Perancak beach to wait for a colorful or dramatic sunset across the river. There is a restaurant where you can have dinner with fish and drinks at a reasonable price.","Beautiful sunset point, seafood bbq with sambal at a local warung, stranded boats in the river mouth. Worth a drive!","Good place for watching sunset.
Should concern to its cleanliness.
And maybe, will look better when it has tourist attraction here."
