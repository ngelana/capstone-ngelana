Ridiculous hotel with 0 morals. Go learn how to do business ethically and maybe you guys would get some good reviews","Reviewing purely for the hotels morals and standards. Not the accommodation itself.

We were planning on visiting the hotel group to attend one of their cinema evenings, when by coincidence we were approached by one of their employees near the GWK statue.

He tried to to persuade us he was giving us ‚Äòfree prizes‚Äô to promote the hotel group.

As usual, this is not just free prizes but an invitation to attend one of their pressure selling presentations for their group membership. After reviewing online feedback on trip advisor , our suspicions were confirmed. Allegedly they do give the prizes away, but only after 2 hours of intense pressure selling and when you tel them no they get aggressive and stare you down.

I was looking forward to visiting for the cinema evenings, but wouldn‚Äôt possibly choose to do so with a hotel group that markets their business in this way.

What a shame.","Very comfy resort, close to the beach and seafood restaurants. A nice place to chill out and relax.",Marketing scam tactics for years to buy their time share memberships.

Fish is so juicy, fresh, and meat so thick, their sambal is really good. It is so delicious, I came here at 14:30 and no need to waiting. It is really recommended place to eat when you come to Bali. I ordered grilled fish, clam, prawn, 2 rice, 2 portion of pickles, kangkung, 2 bottles of mineral water and it only IDR 228k ( around USD 15).","Finally, got the chance to try this seafood street restaurant without long queue ü§≠. The last time I went here, they had a very long queue under small rains and with only little social distancing, so I ended up cancelled my plan to try.

So, what makes this place so popular?
1. This is the place where most of the locals eat seafood. Yes, not at those overpriced beach side restaurants, but at small warong like this. And we all know that locals usually know the best lol.

2. All of their seafood are fresh from that early morning's catch. So, they only sell fresh seawater fish and only as much as they got that day. Once all of their stocks sold out, they will close their warong no matter what time it is. Sometimes if they have no good fresh catch, they won't open the warong. So, better call first and make sure to come early.

3. I have to admit that the fish tasted real fresh. The meat was sweet, juicy, and tender. I usually don't eat fish much, but this time I ate a lot lol. Prawn was yummy and fresh, too. I actually order mussels and clams, too, but I forgot to take the pictures lol. For the clams and mussels, I like it to be more dry, but their style is a wetter one.

4.But what's make it more yummy was the sambals. They have few types of sambals, but sambal matah is always the best, and their sambal matah was perfect. All of the ingridients were cut into very thin size and was combined perfectly.

5. Very affordable price, of course. Their fish costs only 75K/pcs. So heavenly.

Place was clean and relax, people was friendly, service was fast. Will definitely be back again soon.","Fresh, delicious, and waiting list.

There are 2 options in the rooftop villas with a bedroom on the main floor and the other has the bed upstairs.","I stayed at Kupu Kupu recently as my usual hotel was booked out and was very impressed. The rooms were spacious and clean, and the bedding was so comfortable! I would confidently say they had the best mattress and pillows I‚Äôve had in Bali, where I‚Äôve stayed in many properties over the years.

The pool was quiet and peaceful and the staff were absolutely lovely, attentive and kind.

Location is handy and easily accessible and quieter than the usual tourist spots.

The only downside was the hotel breakfast so I‚Äôd suggest going to their beachside option or a local cafe.

Thank you for a lovely stay.","The pictures in their website made us think that it has ocean front but actually the beach is about 10 minutes walk away. The hotel does provide ""golf cart"" ride to the beach though.
Lobby is very pretty, we got a warm welcome with cold tea and apple cake, nice touch!
Room is very large, nice decorated Balinese style, but we could tell from the furniture and overall is a little outdated.
Staffs are lovely, polite and very attentive.",The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful and peaceful and the staff are truly amazing. I had my first massage ever here at their spa and it was the best first experience I could have had. My husband and I each got one and both left feeling like we were walking on air. This is such a special location- I can‚Äôt recommend enough!,"the quality of their staff is BEYOND AWESOME! their hospitality is top notch! I stayed with my parents & closest for 4D3N for Silence Day, and it was a nice experience to stay here.
but, still, this hotel needs a slight renovation here and there to make the experience more comfortable!"

This time opting to buy 2 as the owner told us if we got one the next would be half price. We excitedly agreed and when it came time to pay they charged us full price. Owner was nowhere to be seen and when we spoke to the woman handling payment she said it was already half priced but it wasn‚Äôt. We had 2 600g crabs and they charged us for 1300g of crab which is not one of them half price. Ruined a perfectly good place by a pricing scam. Spent over $220 AUD each time.

Second time around the food tasted different too, was not cooked as well, the sauce was not flavourful and we didn‚Äôt receive a bucket for shells which made eating uncomfortable.","I found this place by looking for a seafood place, I look at the  reviuws and decide to go,
You arrive and looks like you arrive to the wrong place cuz the entrance on the ground floor is just the live crab and lobsters but you dont see people, so you call for someone to come and ask if is open so yes is open, the restaurant is on the 5 floor and you just order on the ground floor.  Once you arrive on the rooftop you will enjor the amazing viuw to the ocean  and city.
Food will arrive in 15 min. Crab was a live so is ao testy . Great food . But the price s the best.","This is one of the most controversial places in my 1,5 month in Indonesia.
Very good price for very fresh seafood.
(Too fresh... they have killed my dinner in front of me...)

Place is super weird. Runned by a local family, everything is very simple, utilitarian and without any attention to details.
Overall I had expected slightly different atmosphere from this place.","I‚Äôve found this place trough google and it was a right hit! We had just the best crabs, they were so fresh, well cooked. We asked for little spicy, so if you don‚Äôt like too much spicy ask for little too! Atmosphere upstairs is really nice. This place was closed for cohos but got open again. Owner is here and it‚Äôs another nice point, he helped us with crabs, my mom was trying it for the fist time. Highly recommend!","Amazing. As we arrived, we were welcomed by our host, Benz, who showed us the live seafood for us to choose. We selected a large crab, a lobster and some drunken prawns. We were then shown to our table on the 5th floor, which has a fantastic view of Jimbaran beach in one direction and the enormous statue in the other. The table was set in the open but under cover. The food arrived quickly and was nothing short of delicious. We had a side order of seafood fried rice as well, which was also very good. The hand basins around the corner for customers to use came in useful as we got stuck in with our hands. I highly recommend a visit to this restaurant."

It‚Äôs very expensive for Bali though and given the price I expected more from the staff and the venue.
Waitresses spent most the time talking loudly at the front counter but it was easy to grab their attention. The air conditioner wasn‚Äôt working which made things quite hot and uncomfortable. And strangely the exhaust was located over the edge of the bbq, which meant we either had to move and hold it over the centre or put up with a lot of cooking smoke.
So not bad but could definitely be better.",Great Korean BBQ restaurant üëç Clean and good quality of meat. Good value. Good service. Bibs are provided üíïI went there at about 2pm. Eating with peace. Love it!,"What a great experience to try an authentic Korean bbq. Excellent service provided by the staff, they have a great initiative skill. We tried the pork & beef combo completed with a lot of side dishes. Truly recommend this restaurant for you who love Korean foodü§©","Update on Dec 2022
6 months later, I visited again this Magal restaurant and I can say they really improve the food, great job.
----
Compared to branch in Jakarta, this outlet seems lack every aspect of great Magal restaurant. They ran out of pork skirt meat, less side dishes & veggies and kimchi taste bland. Service was good though.","I ate here twice during my trip because their Í∞àÎπÑÌÉï was so good! Unlike other Korean restaurants I tried in Bali, where they show a picture of ÏôïÍ∞àÎπÑ in the menu but the actual soup only comes out with sliced meat, this restaurant actually does give you two bones as pictured. I was so excited to eat I forgot to take a picture. Their banchans aren‚Äôt very good, but the soup is on point and tastes great with decent kimchi on the side. The restaurant has AC indoors and they give you a carafe of very cold tea which felt so good in hot Bali. You can pay with credit card and there is a massive parking garage underneath where you can even bring your car."

Delicious grill crab, fish, scallop, prawn and clam. Enjoying the beach view while drink the coconut. All staffs are very friendly, they great us from we come and leave. I'm very happy with that kind of attitude. Will comeback again if we visit Bali.","As the evening progressed, the number of people increased, and the candles lit on the table swayed, making it a great time to eat while watching the sunset. It would have been helpful to have a set menu, since you can't choose the type when you buy by weight. There were about 10 shops to choose from, so I had a hard time choosing one, but the hotel staff gave me some advice and I made the right choice. The people at the venue were friendly and we had a great time. It is also selected as the dinner course for the Uluwatu Temple and Kecak Dance tour. This is a place you should visit at least once when you come to Bali. If you search for Ikan Bakar in Jimbaran, you will find many romantic photos.","The food was ok, and the service was very good and kind! The best thing is the view at the store! Awesome sunset ocean view!","Seafood is fresh, view is nice, but the selection of seafood is not too many if going with a big group. There‚Äôre only 2 options for how to cook the seafood, barbecue or stir fried, and the taste was pretty good!","So this place is one of many on the beach. I'm not sure if the food is the same quality and taste, but we were recommended this place by a friend. We weren't disappointed. You eat on the beach and it's very romantic.

Food was also will grilled and tasty. Also before you buy ask for the price and look at the weight so you won't be ""surprised"". We had an absolutely great time."

I have been visiting multiple times and tried some of dishes including the mala soup and all of them were fantastic too. The food portion are good enough to share up to 2-3 person.,small space but when you tried the food.. wow it's delicious.. their chinese food was another level.. i ordered steam oyster & steam shrimp all is good & delicious.. veggies all cooked well.. definitely will come back next time we stay at nusa dua again..,"The food was amazing here, definitely authentic Sichuan cuisine (the people here seems to be from mainland). I ordered xiao su rou (crispy pork) and suan cai yu (spicy sour veggie with fish and shrimp). The pork was nicely fried, dusted with chili flake for extra flavor but not too strong, good for snacking or with rice. The suan cai yu is just perfect, lots of finely pickled napa cabbage that's not too salty, dori meat was well-cooked that it's not falling apart, and the shrimp was not getting overpowered, loads of garlic and mala spices (be careful not to bite on them). One bowl is for 4 people (hope they'll consider a smaller portion for 2 because my stomach is about to burst). We actually ordered Chinese tea but got curious of the suan mei tang (sour plum syrup), it's a good sweet drink but I like my plum on sour side. The place isn't that big, but the location is not in popular area so it's decent. Indoor area with air conditioner and outdoor for smoker. Price point is surprisingly fair for the quality and taste.","Finally authentic Chinese food in Bali! Feels like back to China. Especially you can find Ma La Xiang Guo, Suan Cai Yu ( spicy sour fish) , RouJia Mo and braised pork feet here. These are my favorites here. Cold dishes and veggies are good too. Not to mention the drink suan mei tang ( plum juice).","If you are looking for a restaurant that provides complete Chinese cuisine, then Hociak is the right choice. Especially if you are visiting Jimbaran.

The menu choices are quite a lot, ranging from those using pork, beef, chicken, to seafood. There are two spaces, closed room with AC and open space without AC. Prices are not exactly cheap, but they're still reasonable for domestic tourists and local residents."

Sandpiper Bali's location might be easy to miss, but it is definitely worth a visit when you are in Jimbaran.

Everything was fresh and amazing. Really glad this place is close to our hotel because we will definitely be coming back again!,"Place is super cozy and clean, with an upstairs area as well. Loved the decor with the funny coffee-related slogans.

I got the syrniki and an Oreo milkshake and both were amazingly good. Highly recommend this place for an easy meal.","The coffee was amazing. One of the best coffees we had in Bali so far. We tried Iced latte and hot americano and both were very thick and full of flavor.

Beef rendang bowl was nice, and loved the smoothie bowl especially.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, this place has air conditioner in first floorü§©"
