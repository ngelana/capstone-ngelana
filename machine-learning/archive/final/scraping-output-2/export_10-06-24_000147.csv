ChIJWfWMw4cH0i0RcYxh03is8Aw,Villa di Bias,-8.407749899999999,115.5976311,"HHVW+7FX, Jl. Raya Ababi, Ababi, Kec. Abang, Kabupaten Karangasem, Bali 80852, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=932434757808131185,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3706-2602,,"hotel, lodging",4.7,88,,"I was captivated by the beautiful view immediately after I stepped into the property before I was even led to my villa. I booked a one bedroom villa which is located down at the hillside near the rice field. It is a semi-attached villa where there is an  infinity pool that is shared with the adjacent villa. The room is spacious. The bathroom is huge in proportion.

The most amazing thing about this hotel is the layers of scenery in front. We could see the sunset afar behind the rice field, which was behind our swimming pool that gives a beautiful reflection of  the sky. The rice field is 5 minutes walk from the villa. We were greeted by the friendly villagers of different ages when we strolled into the rice fields, including a group of cheerful young boys. I was even welcomed by a cat who came to me in the evening when I was sitting out at the pool. It was so affectionate that it kept rubbing my legs.

The staffs of the hotel were welcoming and attentive. I highly recommended this hotel.","Stunning villa with breathtaking views—you can’t beat this place! The pool is amazing and the atmosphere is private and serene. The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean, the bed is super comfortable. Everyone working there was so helpful and lovely. We loved our stay and would come back anytime. Don’t miss this place!","We stayed at the Villa w/ private pool for 4 Nights. Terrific views - rice terraces, Mt Agung, etc. If you looking at getting away from the Seminyak crowd, this is the place to go be. Great option to unwind.

Lack of global food options, available of Grab drivers may be the cons.","When you arrive, the host will add you to a WhatsApp group that is used to facilitate conversation. You can request your needs via this group. The breakfast is good and needs to be confirmed the previous evening with the host. We din't have lunch or dinner as we were mostly out exploring during meal time.

There is no TV in the room but a kickass projector with Netflix and YouTube. With really good surround speakers we did manage to catch movie in bed after a tiring day.

The best part of the Villa is the pool and the fantastic view of rice fields and Mt. Agung. We cancelled our plans to go out and decided to spend a whole day in the pool itself :)

The Temple Of Penataran Agung Lempuyang is 15 mins away by scooter from here. Don't recommend it at all given the 2 hour long lines to click a photo. Instead there are nicer temples around the Villa. You can instead go to Tirta Gangga and also ride 20 minutes into Amlapura and see the Taman Ujung. Lesser crowds and great photos here as well.

Getting to the villa takes about 2 to 3 hours from the airport. Make sure you let the host know you will need a scooter and they will arrange one for you. Fantastic hosts, absolute privacy and amazing memories. Will definitely be coming back soon.","Villa was so new and very beautiful. Spacious and stunning views. Location is perfect, 15 mins by bike to Tirta Gangga, and if you are plan to go to Lempuyang here is the best place to stay. But the staff was not so helpful and not so sincere. They will try to tell you that you can not find foods or car or whatever and only have to book with them or their friends with very over price. ( Actually you still can use delivery App both foods and taxi service on grab or gojek)"
