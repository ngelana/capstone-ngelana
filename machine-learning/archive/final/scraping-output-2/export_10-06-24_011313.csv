I have a good sleep during my stay here.

Things that need to be fixed :

1. unfortunately, the breakfast need to get more attention for the taste and the Variant.

2. The television is not working, I Already inform this to the staff but I didn't get any news after that.

3. They have 4 dogs... Honestly I like animals, but when they are approaching me during breakfast, sometimes they scratched their body part and it will makes the dogs hairs falling everywhere, i'm not comfortable with that. You need to control them.

4. There's a water inside the kettle, idk since when the water is in there. I was electrocuted from the kettle while I need to make a coffee and it makes me scared to use it again in the next day. You need to change it.

5. A lot of flies there, I understand it's because of the season (maybe) but you have to get solutions for that.","We found the hotel on the  Google map we stayed there for 2 weeks , the view from our hotel was amazing with Hills and very peaceful . ibu Wayan is the owner and her family  were very friendly and always smiling and very helpful and she is also cooks very delicious indonesian food.

The place is very beautiful with great views, and the hosts are the most welcoming people I‚Äôve met. They help you with everything, even renting a scooter, booking tickets for a boat and driving you to the harbor.
They cook breakfast, lunch and dinner with you, all with fresh ingredients, and it‚Äôs delicious.

Terima kasih!
