You can only reach with scooter or walk 15-20 minutes I guess. The scooter ride is very hard and if you are a beginner or 2 people on the bike it is better to walk.","Before you park someone who lives there come and sell you tickets for 15,000 Rupis per person. But on the ticket it says it is a donation. Anyway, the waterfall is amazing. There were not many people. When we arrive there, there was only me and my wife. The hiking part takes 15 minutes. Be sure you have proper shoes or sandals (not flip-flops). Enjoy the beauty.","very beautiful 3 waterfalls. entrance 15 000. but difficult to find all 3, because is no signs. it is necessary to fix the paths","Location and pictures are deceiving. Google nos sent me to the other side which bike can not go, so I used my common sense to bike round me find the actual marked trail. Which picture is attached. Also attaching pictures of the real waterfall some people posted another one which has a similar name but n hour south. Be mindful of terrain, small bike can go through also confident drivers. If you’re a beginner rider or not confident I’d advice to prove bike at the 800m mark",Takes around 30 minute to drive from the main street to waterfall. Have to be extra careful since the road is narrow and slipery. But we have amazing waterfall for ourself.

My wife and I got to enjoy it all alone because it is remote and a bit hard to find.
You can only reach it by walking or on a moped. The road is too thin for a car. The turn of to access the path to the waterfall is hard to find so don’t be afraid to stop and ask a local in the town before!",,,,
