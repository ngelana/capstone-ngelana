Just wow. This is my definition of real authentic japanese food. The chef is actually japanese himself, hence explains the amazing taste and vibes. The place itself was very a 90's aesthetic vibe which is great! Now the food here, is amazing. I ordered 3 meals and 1 dessert,all of them were a blast. I will definitely come again!","Sorry to break it this way, i wish i could like this place, but I don't. They got this 90s vibes on their restaurant but sadly cobwebs are everywhere, and it did smell like people had been smoking there for years. The emptiness of the restaurant and their restroom was so dirty, found 2 big cockroaches laying on the floor. Those reasons are enough to make me question the hygiene and stuff from this place.

I wanted to try their sushi but my gut told me to pick something else, so we did. We ordered chicken skin sandwich onigiri, the taste was not that great, it was mediocre but expensive. Both the lady and the guy didn't even bother to welcome us with hospitality. I read from a comment here on google review that the guy is Japanese and he didn't really speak English or bahasa, and he's shy. But a smile and a ""thank you"" would suffice, on which i didn't get none.","Our favourite was the takoyaki dan the zaru cha soba, the sauce was delicious.
The owner also very nice.","Got recommendation from famous foodblogger in Bali to try this Japanese stall.
I agree, this is one of hidden gem for Japanese food in Bali. So delicious and have many options available.
Access a bit far, but definitely worth for visit.","Bali Hidden Gems.
Authentic Japanese Food,
I think Fukudako deserves this tagline,
The sushi taste was brilliant üëç"
