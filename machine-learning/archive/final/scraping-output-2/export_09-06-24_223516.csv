The journey to the falls was a beautiful adventure in itself, with lush greenery and rice terraces lining the way. When I arrived, I was welcomed by the sound of cascading water and the serene ambiance of the surrounding forest.

The waterfall itself is stunning, with multiple streams creating an impressive display. The crystal-clear water was refreshing, we did not take a dip after our hike. But others were in the water. I was amazed by the natural beauty and tranquil atmosphere that allowed me to truly disconnect and immerse myself in nature.

The pathways were well-maintained, making the walk to the waterfall easy and enjoyable. Approximately 30 minutes walk down, various steps and flat concrete pavers. There were several spots along the way that offered breathtaking views and photo opportunities.

You can always hire a ride with a local to take you back up the hike for less than $10 dollars (100k IDR - cash only)

Overall, Banyu Wana Amertha Waterfall is a must-visit if youâ€™re in Bali and seeking an escape into nature. Whether youâ€™re an adventure enthusiast or just looking for a peaceful retreat, this hidden gem wonâ€™t disappoint! Various levels of fitness you can pick from. I Highly recommend!","good trekking area in North Bali, there are a wide waterfall, the trekking is medium track and clean path, youâ€™ll find some amazing plants in the walk! need to buy tickets for entry and parking, the vehicle access is up and down in the small road","Twenty-five minutes to go down to the main waterfall, a good sweat of around thirty minutes to go back up.  The path is well maintained but often steep and sometimes slippery, be sure to wear good shoes.  There are small shops down there, and you can use an ojek for most of the journey in one direction or another.  When arriving at the shops at the bottom, there is a sign indicating 70 meters to the left (these are the small waterfalls) and 200 meters to the right (this is the big one) which in both cases is well undervalued and in the  two cases there is a good part of stairs.  The two small waterfalls are also worth seeing.","This is from my chasing waterfalls trip in Bali. After visiting Banyumala waterfall, I go straight to this place. I get 4 waterfalls in one go.
Entrance ticket 25k for local. I was there in the afternoon, pretty quiet. I was the only visitor in the first waterfall that look like curtains. It feels so surreal, like my own private theater. So peaceful and magical.
I love the sound of nature along the walk. Quite a long and steep walk. Prepare your stamina.","Beautiful falls and doesnâ€™t feel too commercialised. We visited in monsoon rain but this added to the experience as the falls were in full force. A fair walk down to the falls but they offer motorbike rides up and down if you want, the walk through the forest is very good. Steep and a little slippy in some places."
