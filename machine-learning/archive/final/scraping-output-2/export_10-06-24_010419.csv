The gym and pool is average in terms of equipment variety and size. The employees are polite and helpful. Meals are tasty but the menu will be monotonous if you are staying for days.","This is a very good hotel with a great location by Denpasar.  It takes you out of the tourist traps that are so crazy in Bali.  I mean Kuta, Sanur, Ubud, Seminyak, Jimbaran etc are ALL very nice places but we come to Bali for Bali not to see hoards of tourists that are so out of place.  Ok to see for a bit but after a while it gets stressful ... The crowds of tourists are maddening not to mention those having a great time but drunk.  Love those times when the tourists just lay back n chill, maybe most of the tourists are east European ... Much alike the hectic Chinese.

Denpasar is still very Bali and Harris is located in a narrow but long corridor of land.  Deep in but still with great access to the main street.  Hotel is peaceful, clean & inviting.

Behind HARRIS is another hotel POP.  There's ample parking space in the back and parking is free here.

For those that would like to avoid the crowds and don't mind driving around Bali ... This is the hotel to stay.

There's only 1 small star missing ... There's a bit of toilet flies problem.  It's not only here but have noticed this in some locations in Bali all the way to the toilet in the museum by Ubud.  It's a very simple solution but need persistence to fix.

Will be back here in my next trip to Bali. Hope they fix the small toilet flies problem in my next stays.","A great place to host meetings and events. Staff were courteous, friendly and helpful. Definitely highly recommended hotel as your destination for meetings and conventions.","Over all, the service was good, especially the gym center. But for the laundry, quite complicated for the payment.","Cleanliness is good.
Room is spacious enough.
Parking lot is far from the entrance, but vast enough."

Tried the bakmi kering and as North Sumatran who love bakmi, I can say this one is delicious. I love the noodle texture.
The soup it self is quite tasteless, but when you pour it to the noodle and mixed it, the sauce from the noodle make it perfect.

What I dont like is about the smell from the drain. And the waste they put in front of the resto.
Will much better if they keep the resto clean.","The bakmie kering was really great, love the soup.
