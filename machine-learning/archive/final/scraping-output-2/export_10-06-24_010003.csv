He knows that I really like coffee but want to try something different other than normal cafe and we came to this place. I can say this  most likely a coffee sanctuary where we can see from the beginning / first step, coffee bean being treated until served to you. One of the most expensive and legendary for a coffee is Luwak Coffee Wild from Kintamani (they even have Luwak - live animal but only for research purposes, the coffee it self being collected from small forest/garden by the farmer).  on this place you also can see how Balinese people try to roast the coffee manually using fire stove with the wood as a fuel and earthenware to roadt the coffee, with small fire You will only need to pay 60,000 IDR, in order to taste it. Other than that, we can enjoy this coffee in small gazebo next to the river and a pura (a holy place for hinduism to do praying). Really peaceful and love much enjoying that such of experience.

You will also be served to taste around 12 small cups consist of coffee and tea, and after that if you like it you can buy at their small store. You can pay it cash or buy using Card. If not wrong, this place also have such a room to stay overnight but r di not have detail info yet about it. Overall, really love the situation/ambience, love the taste of the Wild Luwak Coffee Kintamani and also arabica kintamani, love how the way the serve and for sure I recommend to come to this place, if you want try something different on how to enjoy the coffee in the different ambience üôèüèª","I've always wanted to try Kopi Luwak and finally got the chance to when we visited Taman Ayu.
