ChIJn5Robd8l0i0RtqYXxD5hU0k,TAPSA (Taman Alas Permata Sari),-8.451188,115.1396417,"Jl. Raya Buruan, Buruan, Kec. Penebel, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82181, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=5283673710041474742,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 9570665,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.7,120,,"TAPSA totally deserves more recognition; it's a true hidden gem! 10 stars are not enough to tell how much I love the ambience of this place. If we went further into the Taman Bidadari (Garden of Angels), there is a big garden, complete with ponds full of fish, that would make us feel like we were really entering an angel palace. You can also eat in the gazebo near this garden if you want to enjoy the view to the fullest. There is an orchid garden too, which is my favorite spot. If you are lucky, you can witness the colorful orchids blooming. The restrooms are clean and beautifully decorated. TAPSA is definitely not a place that is only view-oriented, because along with all that beautiful ambience, the food was extremely delicious and affordable, but if you come late, some food might be out of stock since the restaurant is always filled with lots of visitors. A magical place to make great memories with family or friends. ‚ô°","Our favourite lunch/dinner place in Tabanan!

Balinese and Eastern European menu with fair prices","I had a cup of bali coffee, it taste so good! This is a nice place for taking a time out by the pond.","Very nice restaurant with good atmosphere. Very clean and good aor circulation.  It is very easy to find.
