Private pool with jacuzzi for two villas. The place offers food, drinks for lunch, dinner etc... Amy is very good and friendly host. Everyone is ready to help you with everything you need. No car access to the villa, the pick you up and take off to special place from where you can go with a car. A lot of sightseeings are close. Rice fields aroun the villas are good for a short walk. Also a canyon with small river for a nice walk with clean air, just be careful for meeting some ""big"" lizards like small type of varans. Highly recommend the place for good and quiet vacation. The price is perfect for the quality.","when seeing the hotel, I couldn‚Äôt help but scream in awe. üíïüôåüèª The interior is incredibly spacious, clean, beautiful and the staff are very friendly. You can truly feel the real jungle, and nobody disturbs this peace. It‚Äôs the perfect place to relax. I will definitely revisit next year.  But finding the way was too difficult. I arrived at 11pm, but there were no signs, and I thought I had come to the wrong place. The hotel is inside the jungle, so have to ride a small cart to get there. The hotel didn‚Äôt answer the phone in the evening. I had to ask the driver to take me there. There should be clear indications of the entrance, contact information.","Room and cleaness
Room was truly beautiful and clean, bathroom was stunning i think it was really great value for the price of the room. 10/10

Staff
Ami was great, very, friendly and helpful. Always smiling and giving out positive energy. Other staff members were also very kind to us. 10/10

Instructions and text response time of front desk
Instructions were crystal clear and front desk answered within minutes 10/10

Food at the hotel
Breakfast menu was big enough, so there was option for everyone. There is also restaurant which same as the room, is truly stunning. 7/10

Activities at the hotel
Hotel has very relaxed pool, jacuzzi and also provides (for fee) many activities around the area. Wifi in our room was great. 10/10

Sleep
Nothing bothered us during our stay. 10/10

Location
Since hotel is in outside ubud area it is more-less in the middle of nowhere, we found it difficult to rent a scooter since scooters at hotel are overpriced, also there are no restaurants and outside of hotel there is really nowhere to walk. Around hotel there is construction work, which however did not bothered us during our stay. 3/10

Overall
Hotel is located in very quiet area with jungle feeling. Vilas/restaurant are really beatiful and staff very friendly and is really working really hard to keep hotel, pool and surroundings extra clean. Overall i give this hotel 8.5/10","This place is just great. Very nice room, the environment is really cozy, quiet and relaxing. Great location if you need to unplug yourself for a while and Ubud close by too. The staff couldn‚Äôt be more friendly and helpful with excellent restaurants onsite providing a good mix of Asian and western food. Definitely a place I would recommend to visit. Plus the views from the room are amazing with lots of beautiful plants and birds to see!!","First we stayed in cabins on stilts under the trees. These are simply but tastefully decorated. Great for a retreat or to just get away from things. Really quiet relaxation on the balcony daybed.

We also got to stay in the two double rooms sharing a pool between a wooded river and rice fields. Really lovely and peaceful. Great warm and cool pools! We really enjoyed our stay here and felt very relaxed afterwards. The price is very reasonable compared to similar places in the area."

Went there at 10am and almost all the pork crackles were gone. The plate also includes deep fried lung and liver-very small potion. It wasn't as spicy as I thought and my stomach was still feeling okay the next day. The owner also speaks some English so it wasn't hard to communicate.,"The babi guling is veryyyy appealing and tasty. The pork skin was crunchy and tasty. The ‚ÄòAres‚Äô soup ( made of banana stems) was warm and savory and fresh. The pork meat was generous and juicy. They pour the rice with broth based soup.
The good news is, it‚Äôs only Rp 20k !

(Next to this restaurant, there‚Äôs a tukang gorengan selling fried sweet potato/ ubi goreng, and it‚Äôs warm, sweet and soft in the inside, i ate it on the way home. Love it.)","I can confidently say that this restaurant sells the tastiest pork rice in Bali with an affordable price tag. One portion is only 20 thousands Rupiah. The portion is also large. And the pork skin--my God I already missed it--is so tasty and its crunchiness is just right.

I am definitely coming back to this place again during my next visit. Definitely. I just can't have enough of the pork skin.",Very recommended balinese rice . Cheap and spice so good..,"Hidden gem along the way to padma ubud.. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è come early, usually gone before lunch"
