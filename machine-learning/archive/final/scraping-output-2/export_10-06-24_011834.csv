There‚Äôs not much crowd here and the tide is very far from the beach so you can just swim or rent the canoe. I super recommend this one. It feels like the Melasti Beach before there is beach club there.,"One of the best beaches in Uluwatu area. It‚Äôs a bit secluded, but it‚Äôs worth the visit..
you can come to this place anytime of the week.","You have two options for getting to the beach.
You take the small bus (for a fee), which is a nice experience, or you walk down the many stairs,which is also a nice experience although you will break a sweat.
It's very scenic walking through the tunnel in the cliffs.
At the beach is a warung woth an okay selection of food for reasonable prices and with amazing views.
On the beach itself you can rent a kayak or swim in the clean water.
Tends to get quit crowded during the sunset hour, but it's definitely worth the visit even though you both pay for entrance and parking.
Don't forget to support the warungs around the parking lot after your trip.
Highly recommended.","Private beach with access through Gunung Payung cultural park, which is a plus because you get to walk through the park too. (20k)
Few stairs (as almost every beach in Uluwatu).
Clear water, no waves and quiet.",Goes there at around 3PM and it looks so good when the sun is still shining thru the waters. Would recommend taking a swim and play canoe there or just chill. Great place.

Seemingly impossible, but we found it in Timbis Beach Club. We arrived around noon on a weekday and only a few other people were there, so we got the perfect spot on lounge chairs near the pool. While it got a little bit busier later in the day, you can book beforehand as well to reserve your spot! The beach club is small, but has beautiful views and very clean facilities. The infinity pool was clean and the perfect temperature and had a great view of beach! The service was impeccable - the staff were so sweet and helpful! The food and cocktails we had were delicious, and I thought were reasonably priced for a beach club - we had two meals and some drinks and met the 250k minimum spend person person for the lounge beds. This beach club is perfect for those who just want to relax with great views and service, and are looking to avoid a party-focused beach club.","Paradise Found at Timbis Beach Club!

Tucked away on the stunning Pandawa Beach, Timbis Beach Club is a hidden gem that exceeded our expectations in every way. From the moment we arrived, we were treated to exceptional service, warm smiles, and breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean.

The beach club's laid-back vibe and stylish decor made us feel like we were in a tropical paradise. We spent our days lounging on comfortable sunbeds, snorkeling in the crystal-clear waters, and indulging in delicious cocktails and fresh seafood at the beachfront restaurant.

Timbis Beach Club is a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a relaxing and unforgettable Bali experience. We can't wait to return and do it all again!

*Highlights:*

- Stunning beachfront location
- Exceptional service and staff
- Delicious food and drinks
- Comfortable and stylish amenities
- Romantic and relaxing atmosphere

Unlike single fin and uluwatu beach, it's a hidden beach. Not so crowded.","Finally, I stumbled upon a beach club in Bali that isn't overly crowded and has a clean beach. Timbis is a lovely beach club with stunning views of Pandawa Beach.

I tried their chicken wings and potato wedges, and they tasted delicious. The cocktails were also great.

The best part about this place is that it's not too big or fancy like others that are full of tourists taking endless pictures. The vibe is very chill, and the staff are incredibly friendly.

This place has definitely become my favorite spot","We had an amazing time at the Timbis Beach Club!
We loved every moment. The stuff is great, the food delicious, restrooms and shower clean and the pool amazing.
Definitely coming backüòä","beautiful place, delicious food, the atmosphere is comfortable, if you want to eat while enjoying the view of the blue sea and sunset you can visit this place. very recommendüëçüëçüëç"
