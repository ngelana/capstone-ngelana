From the first moment of entering, being shown around the gardens, and then provided with a selection of delicious teas and coffees we would have been delighted with that. Then the added bonus of some of the tastiest food we have had in Bali just puts it to the top of our list.

The location, the service, the food and drinks and the little shop inside. All was perfect, we will recommend this place to everyone.","A very beautiful caf√© at the border of the city. They have their own garden of tea and herbs someone can visit and try their different tea flavours.
We had some tea and lunch there which was exceptionally delicious üòã.
The rice terraces in the background are an additional highlight.
Overall the best caf√© experience in Bali.","By luck I‚Äôve stopped by this amazing spot just few minutes drive from Munduk. It‚Äôs indeed a peaceful oasis where to taste the real Bali and its rich variety of products, such as caff√®, cocoa, coconut and all sorts of fruits. The owner took over is family‚Äôs land and start his brand new activity where he grows organic coffee. He‚Äôs very passionate and takes the time for explain alla the variety of plants and cultivation. A real hidden gem of Bali!","Came here on a recommendation from my driver, and really happy we did. Kubu is beautiful, set between a spice and coffee garden and rice fields. The staff are really friendly and helpful, and gave us a tour of the gardens and a chance to sample all the teas and coffees they produced there for free (with the exception of the luwak coffee, which was 60k rupiahs). It was so relaxing and lovely to sit back, have a coffee and snacks, and enjoy the view. Would definitely recommend!","Wow. This is an amazing place to visit, I wish I could give it 10 stars. Such an unique experience, coffee and tea tasting, delicious food and such charming and kind people. It's situated by a beautiful rice field , the surroundings are truly stunning. Surrounded by a beautiful garden full of fruit trees and different spice plants. Words cannot describe the uniqueness of this place. It's fairly new, only been open for 6 months. If you are in the area do not hesitate to pop by and enjoy. ‚òÄÔ∏è"
