There are 2 parking area for car and motorbike
From the parking car no need to claim the stair to get up the waterfall
There was a restaurant on the top.
Easier access from car park.
For entering this place no need exact ticket fee, you just give the donation.
Must be visit this place !!!","A beautiful waterfall in picturesque Sidemen. Of all the waterfalls we saw in Bali, Gembleng was one of my favourites.

It was easily found, but really it‚Äôs best to reach it by scooter as cars would find it difficult to navigate. Once we paid the reasonable fee, we headed up the waterfall. It is quite a climb but there are plenty of places to stop and take in the views.

The pools at the top made a fantastic photo spot, and it wasn‚Äôt too busy when we visited on a rainy afternoon.

The views from the top are beautiful, so it is worth the climb. There is a place to grab something to eat or drink at the top too.

I would recommend a visit as it was an impressive waterfall with spectacular views over Sidemen.","A nice place and beautiful views, but it's not really possible to relax as there are lots of people waiting to take photos. It's 20k entry fee. I'm glad I visited, and I would recommend if you're nearby or passing, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to visit.","An obligatory natural destination in western Karangasem. The waterfall pools and view are exquisite. The access to the natural pools are very easy because there are flies of stairs. The waterfall is cleaned and brushed every morning by the local people to keep it clear and not slippery.

There are no obligatory fee to enter the area, but make sure to give gratuitous donation as a tips for the local people who keep the waterfall neat.

It took only 5 minutes hiking to reach the middle up pools, in my opinion they're the best pools.

We visited at Sunday morning (¬±7 am) and the waterfall feels private.

Make sure to use waterproof footwear.

Lot of free parking for motorbike.",Beautiful waterfall with some lovely pools to dip in too. Steps are very steep with no railings so care is needed. They had begun to install railings at the top the day we went though so I'm sure this will help people üòÄ Beautiful view from the top and cafe and toilet too.
