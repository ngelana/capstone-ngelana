We had an amazing day with a guided tour through the jungle, hiking to the waterfalls and traditional coffee & tea tasting in the coffee plantation. Absolutely recommend üëçüèªüòä",Kadek is a very good driver and guide! He speaks english very well and has a nice sense of humor! You can organise your trip with him how you want but he will always give you a nice tips and advices. He really likes his job. It was a pleasure! ü•∞,"I found Bobo on Google and wrote him a message via WhatsApp, the communication was very good. We got Ari as our driver and he was the best driver we had on our Bali trip! He was very relaxed, flexible, helpful, friendly and nice! We wanted to do 3 waterfalls and he helped us to choose the best waterfalls and had other ideas what we can do on our day. We highly recommend him :)","Kadek is the best driver and Bali friend ever! We toured with him and some of his team during our 3-weeks Bali holiday in oktober/november on several tours, and every hotel pick-up. He had very nice and surprising suggestions for things to do or see and places to eat, but there was also every possibility, understanding and flexibility for our own ideas or wishes. He and also the other drivers of the team have been very reliable, always on time and safe drivers in good cars.
For us Kadek is really the ""biggest""( ;-) and most enthousiastic organiser we ever met! He also organised our Nusa Lembongang ferry tickets and snorklingtour, and getting in contact always went well. We really miss him (and his rock-music!) being back home! Thanks again Kadek for having been a friend and an unforgettable part of our Bali holiday! Jaap & Bri","Good communication on WhatsUp before the transportation booking.
Our driver was Edi. This Guy is AMAZING! Very friendly, really good English speaking, and excellent driving skills.
He advised us a few things, one of the main things he helped us with was to choose at the last minute a good tattoo studio for our small souvenir tattoos (there was a mix-up with the studio that we booked before and we needed to change).
He waited with us in the tattoo studio, then during some other stops as well, basically he was very friendly, helpful and patient.
Highly recommended!
Cheers Edi, see you next year Bro!:)"
