Receptionist are friendly and helpful, give us welcome drink. Cleanliness is very well maintained.
Amenities and room facility are great (bath tub, amenities, mini fridge, mini kitchen with stove etc)

Definitely will be my 1st choice of staying in Bali (hope we can visit Bali again üòÅ)","A hidden gem amongst ubud neighborhoods. Pretty authentic as on Joglo vibes. A very homey place to stay. We held a shooting here with comfortable circumstances, I would love to recommend this place for youngsters ü•∞","This villa is perfect. Quick receptionist, very clean and cozy room, excellent service, and a perfect ambience for family vacation. A literal hidden gem, as this villa is located on south of Ubud.

Although it's located outside crowded areas, small restaurants and minimarts are still available so it's still convenient.

Internet TV and wifi are provided, with also hairdryers and perfect bathtubs to spend your time for leisure.

10/10!","A place I call paradise! The best place to stay in the area, I fell in love with Kirani Joglo, the villas and the staff are amazing! Thank you for your kindness and attention to detail, you made us feel so special! We've already booked again and I will visit this place once per year for the upcoming years! Thank you!!! üôè","Really nice bungalows and the service is great. They waited for me to arrive after midnight and kept some things safe that I forgot behind.

The area is interesting as there is absolutely nothing around not even rice fields so don't have expectations. I stayed as it's close to Denpasar and I needed to be at Immigration which was close enough from there.

The rooms are really nice and very clean. There is a share kitchen too. Pool was nice."

It‚Äôs a beautiful open stage next to a stunning elaborate Hindu temple of Pura Puseh. It is one of the oldest group that perform in this region.","Loved this!
Had a huge open air auditorium to sit in with a roof for shade. Every seat has a good view with graded seating.
The performers were fantastic! Excellent dancing and speaking voices were loud so we could all hear.
The band were good, keeping pace with each other. The show is on every day at 9.30am (with music) and another show every night around 6pm (no music).
Well worth the 150,000 IDR ticket.
Before the show you can have a photo taken with a lady in costume and purchase this after, I think it was 100,000IDR.
I highly recommend seeing the Barung play, very entertaining.",Interesting live theatre depicting the Balinese epic story of good Vs. evil,"We stopped here as part of a day trip experience. The admission is about IDR 150k to see the performance. You can go check out the temple and there are many locals around to ask questions. The performance was a great experience and lasted for about 1hr. You get a description of the play and an outline of the main characters, their role and what they stand for. They also have an orchestra playing music with the play. Great Balinese cultural (spiritual) experience.","It seems that there are several types of performances that take place at this venue. I watched the morning show. A lot of people mention this being a traditional Balinese experience. I have no way of verifying this as I am not Balinese. There were definitely almost all tourists in the audience. As a tourist who often frequents performing arts shows in other countries, I found this quite unentertaining. It‚Äôs true that the costumes and music are great. The storyline was moderately difficult to follow. And about 20 minutes in, it was uncomfortably noticeable how antsy the audience had become. I believe most people, including us, stayed out of respect and not wanting to be rude. If your tour guide recommends this, I think you‚Äôre better off asking for an alternative."

If you are after a something a little different to eat or snack on you must pop in here.  Wow. Twisty potato with almost anything you can imagine.  I had the twisted potato Bolognese and bbq chicken rice bowl.   Both very delicious and crispy.  I will be back,"For first time costumer like myself, this place kinda more like family friendly and absolutely safe food haven for your kids since the food here is basically french fries, noodle (new item) and sausage.
They have mixmatch menu you should try once, which is sweet and spicy maichi!
The fries is still warm and properly cooked, which i like but some of the curly fries are nearly on the burn state, maybe the chef like it that way.
The interior is minimal, they have multiple fans that working okay, the outdoor area is quite spacious but no fan, the toolet is quite... Not so much clean.

For me, solid 4‚≠ê/5 experience","Nice place for couple dinner, they also have kids playground.
But for the food maybe my bad luck, I got hard potatoes. Afterall the price is worth.","Great place for hanging out with friends, cozy place, huge parking lot and great ambience.

As Twissterdog lover, unfortunately their quality of food and drinks still lacking compare to Twissterdog Denpasar

In my opinion, Their fries are overcook, a bit of bitter taste and sometimes its hard. For the drink, our teh tarik taste like water.

I suggest to set a designated smoking area","We sat down with our family and dog. They gave us menus. When we went to order 10 minutes later, they said ""put your dog outside"".  It's not the fact that the dog wasn't allowed inside, we respect that, but more the fact that they watched us get comfortable and ready to order, then said it. Staff definitely need more training!"

It has a vast outdoor settings, gazebo, with a view of a rice field. There's a small playground for kids too. Holding a small scale event like kids birthday party would be perfect.
The food is good. I just expect more for the sambal. Otherwise it's great by considering their reasonably priced  menus. Overall, it's a recommended restaurant for family.","Peaceful Ambience for lunch. My friends had the crispy duck a little bit bony but delicious, I had the grilled chicken which was very flavorful. We sat in a little Hut above a small pond with probably two dozen fish in them. My four-year-old enjoyed looking at the fish and feeding them a little rice. The restaurant overlooks a large rice filled with people collecting the stalks as we ate. The prices are pretty good, and the mixed fruit drinks are fantastic.",We came during lunch time a very hungry stomach for a quick lunch. The food was okay. The view is excellent with well maintained gardens. I wish the music is Balinese traditional instrument (it was saxophone while we were there),"The grilled chicken is suite my taste!

The interior of the restaurant is very cool. You can bring children here cause there is a children plays area.

It's more perfect if you come before harvest season, cause this restaurant is surrounded by padi field.

A rich cultural story with the most beautiful costumes and music. We were provided with written descriptions in English so we were able to understand the story very well. If you want to experience authentic Balinese culture this is worth the stop, but get there early to get the best seats.","Attending the Barong dance at Pura Puseh in Bali was an authentic and insightful experience, allowing me to immerse myself in the Balinese culture. While the ticket prices leaned slightly towards the pricey side compared to other options on the island, it's important to recognize the complexity of the performance involving numerous participants.

One thing that truly stood out was the inclusion of a storyline breakdown in English, which made it immensely accessible and easy to follow. This considerate touch added to the overall enjoyment of the performance.

I highly recommend the Barong dance at Pura Puseh for those seeking a genuine cultural encounter amidst the sea of Instagram-centric activities that have seemingly engulfed Bali. It's a refreshing deviation from the usual tourist traps and serves as a reminder of the rich heritage that often gets overshadowed by the allure of picturesque snapshots.","Excellent exhibition of traditional and authentic Balinese arts and culture.
Highly recommended.","Amazing dance, one of the real Bali culture",Cultural dance it was entertaining
