Thanks McD’s for fun family memories.",Presentation/quality poor. Tasted average. Fries soggy. It is a double McChicken if you can't tell.,"The mc was spacious with 2 levels.

For the rest, their chicken burger was good; their matcha milkshake was good; but their vegan cheesecake was underwhelming. I will personally go for their lava cake the next time i’m here.",Nice atmosphere Great place to hang out. They have a wide variety of drinks to choose from as well. I would recommend this place anyone to have a good evening at. Or to even just go during the day for lunch. It took the staff forever to get to us to even take our order. But still a good experience.

Just by the water, watching the boats and fishermen, you can relax in chill out out couches , waterside or more traditional seating.
The menu offers many delights to eat and drink, also just watching the food arrive at other tables, tempts you with the wonderful offerings
Highly recommended spot.","The food was a bit disappointing and not authentic Italian for sure.
The pizza was okay but not full of flavour as they make it sound on the menu and definitely not worth the higher price tag.
The pasta was just not good, very salty and the seafood looked frozen.
The staff were friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was definitely the best part of this place.","Great location right by the beach. The air-conditioned, relaxing vibe made for a perfect visit to cool down. There’s plenty of seating both indoors and outside. We only tried the juices and a vegan cake—absolutely loved the Biscoff cheesecake, 5/5 stars! However, I’m giving 4 stars overall due to the lack of vegan items on the main menu. There didn’t seem to be any vegan savory options, but the 4 vegan cakes in the fridge looked amazing."

Atmosphere has the smell of the sea being it's not too far from the Sanur beach, but it's comfortable and pleasant.  There's an air conditioned room at the end that usually is booked by groups.

Service is great but can be more attentive as it is difficult to get service until there's eye contact.  However the service is kind, courteous and friendly so I'm still giving 5 stars ... Just need to have minimally with eyes on the floor.","Tasty as always. I really love their baby backrib, along potato wedges on side. The ribs is very sweet, tanget , and tender as well. My second most favorite goes to their pork belly satay. It's sweet and spicy.

Maya has been taking absolutely wonderful care of me and the food has been super nice and yummy. I will be back.,Delicious and generous portion of pork ribs. Love the taste and the ambience.

The food is so delicious, we order ribs and pork knuckle with mac and cheese plus mash potato. The portion is big and more than enough for 2 people.
The ribs is so tender, the pork knuckle is very crunchy, mac and cheese for me is very nice. Mashed potato on the other hand is not as i expected the flavour is so flat.

Everywhere was clean and the pool was never too busy. The breakfast was really nice and the room was spacious. We also ordered pizza for room service and which was tasty.

Facilities for us were second to none, great swimming pool, everyone so willing to help with a smile on their faces. We had a fantastic time at the Grand Palace Hotel",Room was big and tidy but the AC was way too small for the size of the room so we had a hard time sleeping. Great pool and massage at the spa. Breakfast was great and restaurant served tasty food too. Staff were great and very friendly. Location was not perfect at a very busy road but it was walking distance to the beach and the night market. Overall a good stay.,"We were booked for 5 nights and prolonged the stay till 10 nights.
The room qw atayed in was strategically located away from street noise, top floor, overlooking the big swimming pool. The room are spacious, the cleaning is regular, the bedsheets and towels provided are clean. The cleanliness are generally of high standard.
The food , both breakfast and room service was tasty , breakfast had a decent variety even for a vegetarian , room service menu is reasonable enough and you can always ask for modifications.
Sometimes reception would forget things here and there, such as we booked a bike the night before but the next morning's staff wasn't notified about it and other small details.
The gym was small only one cross trainer (slightly broken i suspect) and a treadmill but some floor space available with mats and free weights.
The pool was nice and long .
The downside is the noisy highway the hotel is located on. As soon as you leave the hotel you are faced with such violet traffic that crossing the road to the other side is difficult (but doable).
Overall a good modern hotel compared to others in the area for the same price."

A consistent thing in these reviews is the awesome latte art so here’s mine!
The staff are friendly and attentive.",I just passed by after few times I saw they achieved the sustainable cafe on one of platform. Had my visit this morning after had some treatment on the clinic nearby the cafe. The food was good. The service a bit out of what I expect at that time. maybe because they have a bit bussier hours than usual for guest that ordered bfast. I even didnt get my lunch that I ordered before as I make a note previously to give it on lunch time. Best time come early at 8 so you can enjoy the outdoor long sofa. Much better than the indoor. I wish it could be more than expected for the sustainable product offered.,"Delicious selection of breakfast from big breakfast to smoothie bowls. Good selection of juices, coffee and smoothies. Haven't tried the lunch or dinner menu yet but having skimmed through it I may have to come back later today lol looks very impressive. Air-conditioning is a great relief from the sun and humidity.

The pools are great and kid friendly. There are chickens and birds roaming around, fish in the ponds, lots of space to run around. Buffet breakfast was great, they had coffee machines to make yourself a decent cappuccino and a station to request fresh eggs or omelette, fresh fruit etc.
They have ice baths to use by the pool to cool down after a jog. No fitness centre but we found one to use close by. The staff by the pools weren't overly efficient when a child did a poo in the water, some constructive feedback would be to ensure children who arnt toilet trained use swim nappies and that the staff know what to do in this situation as they didn't really care but overall we had a fantastic stay.
We will be back!
Thank you","Very good value for money. The staff is really friendly, service minded and good with children (as in much of Bali). The prices in Byrd house is a little high compared to restaurants outside the resort, but that is expected.
The rooms are really cozy, but the sliding door to the bathroom was a little old and worn down, so you had to lock it if you wanted to close it.
I can highly recommend.","We can't really fault this place.
We really enjoyed the buffet breakfast as well as the pizza and pasta lunch/dinner dishes.
The best past however, was how nice the staff were to our 10 month old.

Never again! Ac laud and not working, holes in the walls, mold in bathroom and the mattress just so bad, could not sleep all night. We are not fussy travellers trust me but this was just too much!

I spent 2 nights here and it's an ""ok"" experience too. unfortunately the room was very humid. My room was on the 3rd floor and it was very exhausting especially after coming back from a full day exploring bali. For the local tourist u must be prepared because the toilet didn't have a bidet and only the japanese style of b*tt cleanser. Maybe the pool needs to be considered, the water doesn't look good last time i was here. The balcony needs to be cleaned because when i was there it was really dirty. The great thing is they have access to the night market right behind their hotel, for those who are crawling food in the middle of the night you don't have to worry about it. And of course it's close to the beach.

If you are willing to try some local foods you can visit the night market next to the hotel and there are various kind of local foods that you can try there.","It's too dirty. When we checked in, the sheets had not been changed and it smelled disgusting. The bathroom was not cleaned and there were stains on the walls. The water pressure was weak and the sink was clogged.

After enjoying some very beautiful places on the beach around Bali for 50% of what I paid here, I was horrified to stay at what might have been a nice hotel in the past as reflected by its excellent location on the beach and spacious property.   In its heyday, it probably was a tranquil comfortable place but now, it would be best torn down and rebuilt.   Years of neglect make it shameful - I would maybe pay US$15/night at best given the conditions.

The property is tired and dirty and in desparate need of a refresh. Rooms have peeling paint, moldy bathtubs, cigarette burns on the desks, shower water is lukewarm .... and I could go on.    I'm uploading photos.

Guests next door were smoking and their smoke wafted into my room so I ended up wearing a face mask all night so I could sleep. Air con barely working.   Upon complaining to staff, they basically shrugged when I asked to move to a different room.

Unlike places where I've stayed for ","Pool and location great. Gardens great. Breakfast passable. Rooms disgusting. My first room was old, dirty and smelly. Curtains grubby. Shower warm. Toilet not cleaned. Whole bathroom rank. Bedsheets and towels grey not white, stained and ripped. Didn't dare think about the pillows!
Moved to a 2nd room as air con broke. That was much better, it had obviously had a refresh in the last 5 years whereas the 1st room was still in original 1970s decor, furniture and paintwork.
But the 2nd room bathroom was no better. Stained shower curtain, it was really disgusting and the bottom of it had never seen the inside if a washing machine. They don't clean the sink, it had scum marks round it with shaving bits in it. The loo wasn't clean, when you lifted the seat the grime was caked on underneath . It had obviously only had a cursory squire of something without being cleaned.","Inna Sindhu has the best location, it's by the beach, and surrounding with cafe, resto, warung. Easy to find foods.

Ordered them for a family dinner and didn't disappoint at all in their tastes. The taste is suited to local preferences. Portions are big, mind before ordering too much food.

What's better is that how they offer quite an amount of side dishes to complement the main course. They also serve drinks with alcohol options, like the Makgeolli that I had.

The place is very spacious even the parking lot. Price is standard for a Korean restaurant.","It's my second time back here because I like how the food taste. This restaurant serve pork so not recommended for Muslim friend who wants 100% halal food. The food cooked little bit long so if you need a fast dining expirience, better choose other place. All food we ordered taste nice and warm. Some portion may bigger for Indonesian stomach so sharing menu is recommended. Parking lot is big and the restaurant is right beside the main road and before a traffic light so it will be easy to spot. Overall I enjoyed the food here :)",I live in Korea and I was nervous about how the food would be but I can confidently say I was wrong.. The food was sooo good they managed to maintain authenticity. A definite must if you want some Korean Food in Bali,"The best Korean restaurant in Bali.
Today I'm starving and enjoying this food really makes me happy ♥️ .
You have to try the portions for 2-3 people...
Everything I ordered did not disappoint all very good and delicious, friendly staff and cozy place♥️♥️♥️♥️

I will come back♥️","This place offered an authentic culinary experience, with flavorful dishes that captured the essence of Korean cuisine.
The bibimbap showcased a delightful combination of textures and flavors.
The kimchi provided a spicy kick, and the banchan sides added a diverse range of tastes to the meal.
The ambiance was cozy, and the staff was friendly, enhancing the overall dining experience.
If you're a fan of Korean food, this restaurant is worth a visit. 😋🫰🏻"

Stayed for the ambience.

Looking for a quick stopover for lunch and business meeting? This is where I’d choose. Located straight on the left side of Ida Bagus Mantra mainroad, its hard to miss.

Great parking lot! Once inside you can forget the heat for having been driving 45 minutes from the airport.

It caters for both traditional and western cuisine. Serves drinks with great options.

I had heavy meal here and forgot about my diet which I regretted it since I took in full course 🥲

Always happy to come back!","Many times come here never disappointed. Mostly they are full especially when Christmas Eve. Almost no table available. Food are amazing, price is ok, service is quick etc etc. Is a must to come.",the meal was lovely tomahawk was very tender and flavour was great wife had prawns which were nice the service was a little slow but they were all lovely reasonably priced we've been here a few times now and all times pretty good,"The HUB Bali is an interesting eatery designed with a modern “warehouse” concept. Every section is well utilised with visually appealing themes to bring out it’s unique identity.
With both indoor and outdoor seating, the luxury of space and engaging decor make it comfortably special and cosy.
It serves a variety of local cuisine which are delectable with an impeccable service to match.","We had high expectations and so looking forward to eating here.
Through the large glass double doors we went. Unfortunately there was no clear area signed to wait to be seated. Waited nearly 5 minutes to get someone's attention.
Unsure if a particular staff member had been allocated seating duties. Certainly not apparent.
Once we were acknowledged were shown to a table which was clean and ready for diners.
Provided with menus and a new group of diners were seated at a table next to us.
Chose our drinks and food and waited to catch the attention of a staff member, any one but to no avail.
Table who arrived after us rudely intercepted the wait person heading for us and the poor person did not have to strength to say any thing.
Finally we had to chase down staff to place our orders. Some seem to be having a chat rather than watching the diners.
On placing our orders the drinks arrived very quickly, nicely presented and exactly what was ordered."

We arrive on a late flight and after checking in were taken to a room on the 1st floor, away from the pool.

As it was late we decided to let it slide as we were tired. Walking to the room we were greeted by the biggest cockroach I’ve ever seen but again let it slide.  Outside of the room the receptionist who was taking us to the room suddenly advised us that our room didn’t have a double bed, as booked, but only had twin beds. We told him that was not what we booked but he simply replied that our booking was subject to availability. We told him that was not satisfactory as we made the booking a few days prior and they had every chance to inform us.

We then told him that we did not want to stay as the room was not what we booked and requested a refund but he and the manager refused to give us a refund as we had already checked in.

We left the hotel and went to another hotel and lost our money for this booking.  They clearly knew they were doing the wrong thing by firstly checking us in and not letting us know that they did not have the room we had booked .

A very unethical hotel and staff and I would caution anyone trusting this hotel or their staff and would not recommend you leave anything of value in the rooms if this is the way they trick people.

I do not recommend this hotel and warn people to reconsider if they are thinking of staying here.","Excellent experience. We stayed 4 nights. Everything was top notch. Perfect rooms, AC, swimming pool. Great location. Will happily use this accommodation again","Really enjoyed our stay here. It has about 20 or so rooms with a king bed.
Only complaint bed is as hard as a rock and I mean that seriously it is ridiculously firm to the point where I woke up daily aching.
That aside it's an oasis off the main road right near the beginning of the restaurant scene in main st Sanur. Literally a 3 minute walk to the night food markets.
I can't comment on breakfast as I actually don't eat it so went once and had fruit.
Warungs are a minute away on side streets and circle k next door.
Pool was amazing and big enough to not get really warm.
Staff are great and very accommodating.
Grounds are well kept but I can see it could go up a level if attention to details were seen to ie bed and dead plants under fountain lawn cut etc...
Shower is a rain shower and is good.
I ruined a doona with I realized later new costume pants and it was a tiny drama but paid 30 bux in the end for dry cleaning. They send your washing tp someone so can take over a day for returns.
All different nationalities come here.
Now the attached pub has delicious steak from Australia cost is around 22 AUD for a fillet steak. It's great food and covers a few different nationalities.
It gets so busy and I can see why I'd say it's the equivalent to say outback steakhouse.
We stayed in deluxe room I think they are all the same but two have a bit where u can swim up to n go directly to room. Not my thing lol
Overall a great experience but I won't stay again due to being 53 and the bed is too damn hard for this older body.","I was worried about the street noise because the hotel is located next to a busy road, but it was pretty peaceful & quiet in our rooms. We stayed in the pool access rooms, & the rooms were clean, spacious & comfortable; however the TV in my room had problem & only 2 pillows were provided. Those were minor problems compared to the quality of our stay. Helpful & friendly front desk staffs, small but nice pool, & lush garden gave us enjoyable stay in this hotel. Hotel didn’t provide breakfast, but there are many eateries within walking distance.","Very nice and clean hotel. Rooms are cleaned and kept nice everyday and the pool area is pleasant. Service is very good but the breakfast restaurant service is terrible. Besides that, the location isn’t the best but it’s affordable so worth it!"

It's really good. I've had a lot of ramen, but here with pork it's just great, great rich flavor. I'm happy with the service. The staff is attentive, quick. The smoking and non-smoking space is separated, which is very good. There is a waiter call button, which is very convenient because the non-smoking room is away from the kitchen. Recommended visit. The fried chicken pieces are crispy but nothing special in flavor.","Visited this afternoon with my family for some Aka Spicy Chicken ramen. We all enjoyed it—the noodle texture was nice, rich with flavors, and the perfect amount of spiciness in the creamy broth.. Can't stop thinking about it! Plan to order it again at home ♥️♥️","Delicious. Mine (KURO) was to salty, but the noodle is good. I'll still recommend this restaurant. Gyoza was good. The chicken kara-age a little bit oily. When I come, there was to many people inside (crowded).",The food is soo flavourful that each bite is packed with flavour. The spice is no joke aswell. (Maybe I’m just weak.) This is so much better than Ajisan Ramen (in Australia.) 9/10 would recommend,"I’ve eaten here three times now — had to finally leave a review and credit this place for having a good atmosphere, amazing food, and extremely fast service. Each time I’ve ordered, I’ve had my food in around 10-15 minutes, and it’s always exceptional. Great quality pork as well, but could be a little spicier for spice lovers like myself! Recommend visiting this if you’re near by. It’s quality."

Reasonable price & definitely tasty foods.",I mapped this place a while ago and it didn’t disappoint. Amazing arak. Great food. Was lovely to drink with the locals. Will be back when we are in Sanur again!,"One of local alcohol place in Sanur, Bali. They have original and flavoured Arak (local alcohol), it's pandan flavour. Recommended for the ones who'd like to try Balinese's drinks.
Beside that, the non-alcoholic people can enjoy the food! The price's affordable. They have many chicken and pork cuisines. There's ""es gula"" and some non-alcohol drinks too.
The vibe's so Balinese ""nongkrong"" hangout place with international and balinese songs, some graffity, etc.","Pan Tantri Warung is a stall that sells alcoholic drinks and seafood. This stall is located on Jalan Pungutan Sanur. access to this place can be passed by cars and motorbikes, the place is not too wide, the prices for food and drinks are very affordable, starting from five thousand to fifty thousand"

We didn’t choose to stay here; the place we booked was full so we were put here instead as they were both RedDoorz partners. We had seen that it used to be an OYO so didn’t have high hopes to start with to be honest. The main reception area was dimly lit and grubby, definitely needs some maintenance. We took the lift up to our floor (floor 2 but it’s actually floor 3 in the lift because there is no ground floor button, it’s unnecessarily confusing) and it looked promising; freshly painted, new modern looking doors. Taking the room at face value, it was fine. Small and very basic but fine. We were provided with tea and coffee but no kettle; not sure if this was available somewhere else in the hotel. On closer inspection it was not good. The mat for outside the bathroom was supposed to be white but it was black as if people had been wiping their shoes on it. The bedding was covered in stains; what looked like food, drink and blood stains all over the bed and the pillows. We had no choice but to stay here one night so slept on top of the duvet in outside clothes with spare T-shirts covering the pillows. There was 100s of ants crawling up the door frame, inside and outside the room and all over the area near the lift. We spent as much time as possible out of the room because it made us feel unclean. The staff are quite young and didn’t seem too interested in anything but to be honest when you’re young, a job is just a job so can’t be mad at that. The place is a 9 minute walk to the beach and the beach bars and restaurants which was convenient but other than that I would absolutely not recommend this place. We’re not snobs when it comes to hotels; basic is fine for what we need (we’re currently travelling on a budget) but in all honesty, you couldn’t pay me to stay here again.","We stayed here because it was close to the US consulate. The rooms are large, but not very clean even by Bali standards. And the bathroom had a foul sewer smell. I would not stay here again.","Descent transit hotel for Nusa Penida/Lembongan visit. Location is 5, surrounded by famous store such as Jco, Chattime, Circle K, Pizza Hut, McDonald, street stall Pecel Ayam, etc. It seems under staff amid the pandemic, so there were slow response on call and WA. Building is so so, but the facilities such as AC, TV, and hot water are working well.",Room was nice. I forget million in my room and cleaning staff bring it to me when I waiting my grabcar. Really nice people.,"only the location deserves 1 star. everything is bad, building is old, room is dirty and smell so bad, there's no water in the pool. also the staff is busy with their phone. when we checkout there's no one in the reception."
