We ordered a four-person meal and the kids loved it, despite the spicy kick. This place is a hidden gem that'll satisfy your cravings and leave you wanting more!",THE BEST BABI GULING WE HAVE EVER HAD!!!,"Generous servings at Sarin Paon Babi Guling.

I have been eating here once every week (except when I have been travelling) since the warung opened two and a half years ago.

The Babi Guling at Sarin Paon is in Klungkung style and very tasty (not spicy at all, except the chilli bits). The servings are generous: I usually take the smaller portion, Biasa, and that is enough for me.

Another advantage with this warung is that the dining hall stretches into the rice fields with the kitchen between the dining hall and the bypass, so the traffic noise is not as disturbing as in many other warungs along the bypass.

Probably the best Babi Guling warung along the bypass.","Perfect place if you like pork cooked in traditional flavours.

Service was awesome. The owner came and explained the food for us.","Good food, they serve pork only. The staff is amazing!"

It's perhaps the best phrase with which a visitor like you can express his or her dining experience at the local food-stalls known as warung makan. And here's one of those serving you authentic popular dishes the way they're cooked, served and eaten. The brunch portion consists of sate lilit (charcoal-embroiled spiced minced fish on a bamboo skewer), pepesan ikan (roasted spiced fish fillet wrapped in banana leaves), a bowl of spicy fish soup. They're all spicy as they are expected to be. These dishes come with nasi putih (steam white rice) and jukut urab (spiced spinach and bean sprouts served with grated coconut). I'd say your brunch would be taken the best with a glass of fresh citrus juice (air jeruk).",A good warung where you get one dish served for very cheap. Itâ€™s rice with soup and meat and vegetables. I would recommend going!,Really delicious local food and two lovely women who work there,"It's legend

One of the best balinese fish satay
