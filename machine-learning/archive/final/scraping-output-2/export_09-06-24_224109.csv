Kintamani, Kabupaten Bangli, Bali 80652, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17401035578334951170,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3704-5774,,"campground, park, hotel, lodging",3.8,13,,"First thing first, I‚Äôd like to appreciate the owner who‚Äôs very fast resp. I knew this place in tt and instagram as ‚ÄúGarden Hill‚Äù but now it changes to ‚ÄúBelonge Farm‚Äù.

The facilities we get as same as what include in poster.
- a fan
- queen size bed
- hot water
- bathroom amenities (minus no toothbrush/toothpaste) etc. (you can see in the poster)

Maybe because this place is really new (so far I know one month?), some I notice are:
1. There are no windows so though the air was so fresh outside, but inside so hot.
it already get supported by a fan, but I didn‚Äôt think it really worked. I prefer to stay outside.
2. So many flies and bugs in Kintamani. But idk how they manage this. Maybe I expected too much
3. Not that worth the money as new place is more expensive than others.
4. The parking area is small and difficult to reach. But because there are only 4 rooms for 8 peeps. it‚Äôs not a major prob.
5. The taste of the food really üëçüèª.
Dinner & breakfast üëåüèª
6. Slow living vibes
7. You can‚Äôt swim in the small private pool. But it‚Äôs aesthetic enough to take a picture
8. They can offer you the jeep tour (catching sunrise and lava tour). Recommend.
10. Great view
11. No entertainment. You focus on the nature view","I would not recommend this place.
Pros - Good view
Cons -
1. The room is hot & stuffy. Has no fan or aircon. If you open the doors there are swarms of flies that accost you. I requested for a standing fan. The owner said his other customers are happy & don‚Äôt need it. The doors of the room have wide gaps so be prepared for flies from sunrise to sunset.

When I explained how uncomfortable it was the Owner was very rude saying we should leave if we don‚Äôt like it (at 9pm at night in the middle of nowhere)

2. We asked for a vegetarian breakfast (menu is only fried rice or pancake by the way) We were given meat fried rice with a large egg. So Ofcourse we had no breakfast. Great way to start the day. The owner didn‚Äôt care when informed.
3. The bed linen was dirty. Photos attached
4. Room was sparse with a cupboard like thing where you couldn‚Äôt put anything Photos attached.
5. We were told there is a restaurant on the premises. FYI the ‚Äòrestaurant‚Äô has a menu of 2 items. Fried rice & pancakes that are served with a minimum of 6 to 10 flies perched atop

All in all a bad experience which the Indonesian owner made worse by being incredibly rude.",Beauty place. beauty room but they are smelty cause of bad √©vacuation. No Wi-Fi.,,

First of all, the villa and rooms are MUCH better than it looks in pictures. Extremely clean room and bed with exceptional attention to detail. You won‚Äôt find a stain anywhere, not even in the walls. It also feels luxurious and fashionable, blending rustic luxury with Bali‚Äôs essence.

Second, it has the best pool in Bali, with its water taken directly from the thermal natural pools in the volcano. It gets super hot and comfortable.

The location is perfect, super close to the volcano for trekking and other activities.

The most important part of this review is the hospitality and kindness of the owners. A family who completely takes care of everything with the best of their heart. They‚Äôll make sure everything is perfect. I don‚Äôt understand how just a family can have better service than 5 star hotels and the effort they put into making you have the best stance.

The dinner is fabulous as well.

They deserve you to come here, you won‚Äôt regret trust me.","I stayed here for New Year day.
I liked the area. Surrounded by green nature around. Farmers land. Great view to mountain.

Why 4 ‚≠ê
No AC in the room. In the day very hot.
In the night is chill.
The pool is Hot springs water.
The owner & staff they are friendly.
When I came, they gave me ice tea as a welcome drink. Nice!","Overall...everything was great, except.... to many flies at day timeüòä","Thanks for Hospitality,  the owner and staff really Great and Good service,  they very friendly and fast response..
Really recommended to stay here , Room big , new and Nice ... pool Volcano spring water and Very clean",

They made me spend my time without being honest with me as client.",I'm very upset with the personal of this place. We had a reservation and we asked them by phone and WhatsApp if we could cancel it for free. They said yes but that we needed to manage it through booking. So we did it but they didn't confirm the cancellation so we lost the money. I don't recommend to trust them :(,"Really nice place. Amazing views. Toilets really good.
The staff were so welcome offer us dinner and breakfast.
Owner really friendly

He is a very attentive driver, when we wanted to take action he did it. And when I wanted to rest, I calmly drove my car. Both photography and video for memory are his superpower. Jro Diana.
