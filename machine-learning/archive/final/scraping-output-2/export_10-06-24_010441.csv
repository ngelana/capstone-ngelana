I ordered a Cortado and my partner ordered a flat white, and when they arrived it was more like two lattes, absolutely wasn't a Cortado that's for sure, the cup was huge! The latte art was very impressive however that was unfortunately the best part about the coffee. There wasn't much texture to either of them resulting in a pretty average coffee. The staff were friendly upon entering and found us a place to sit which was nice. I know the Batista's have won multiple awards here, especially for latte art, but for me the coffee wasn't anything special. We both ordered a cookie each and they were good. There's a downstairs seating area which was really busy, but upstairs has a few tables and is much quieter. I didn't see until I was leaving that they serve v60/filter coffee (didn't see it on the menu), if I knew this I would've ordered a v60 instead.",Pastries are normal but coffee and their noodles were so so good! Must order and prices is super affordable compared to other places in canggu area. Cute coffee takeaway packaging as well.,"Their coffee is one of the best in Bali, they roast their own beans. Very cozy and warm place for breakfast & lunch, they closed on dinnertime. The chicken sandwich is honestly my favorite thing ever, the sourdough is toasted perfectly with butter such a culinary masterpiece that left my taste buds dancing with joy.
Staff are friendly, welcoming people who are well trained to please and smile.",Not the most remarkable brunch option in Canggu but definitely a good one / a safe choice. The staff is really nice and the prices are very accessible. :),"The cafe has 2 floors. The first one is cosier than the second one. The food overall is good. I would suggest a different bun for the eggs Benedict, as the one they have now feels a bit tasteless and plain. Otherwise, delicious breakfast place. Not the most comfortable place for working."

The waitress is so helpful in explaining the menu, and very helpful in suggesting it. It was a great experience and really looking forward to go back again.","2 stars because service is nice. Cocktails are not great and expensive. I ordered 2 different cocktails - they tasted the same. The room was full of smoke and someone was even smoking a cigar, so I started to feel very bad.

I won‚Äôt recommend if you‚Äôre not a fun of cigarettes and strong cocktails.","Exclusive. The perfect word to describe this hidden gem bar. The concept is very well-thought from the moment of we entered, password is required which is given through the booking process. Ambiance is super chill and romantic, The bar size, although quite small, it's still convenient to visit especially before it gets crowded.

We tried most of their signature cocktails! But our favorites were Rum Punch, Bad Blood and Aperol Sour. Taste is complex yet still in good balance.

Guests are given the choice to pick their favorite song to play by the DJ. Servers were accommodating and friendly. Music-wise is up to our liking.

Can't wait to come back for another party night!"

The shwarma place was excellent but Mayang Boga roas was awful. As in the pictures attached, you get 90% rice and a dried old piece of meat in their beef rendang. I took this back and the guy microwaved me another piece after looking sheepish and apologising. Overall good selection and atmosphere with affordable options but not all vendors are serving in good faith.",Really nice place to eat or to gather. Kind of garden with different food stations (from Indonesia to western to Indian...) plus beer and ice cream. Food start at 30k. Fried rice is 40k. There are chairs or bean bags with tables or you can sit directly on the floor. Good vibe and the ambiance is awesome. Sometimes there band or dance on the middle of the place. Nice toilets. ATM are just before to enter. Maybe the parking is little bit too small when its crowd it. Definitely a place to go.

It was also quite close to the beach, especially if you rent a scooter.

The room was nice and clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful! The swimming pool was great as well!
I‚Äôd definitely recommend this place !","Such a peaceful and clean hotel.
Has a shared kitchen with fridge and appliances.

Water provided in our room.
Super friendly staff - I had an injury in street and staff helped by providing first aid kit for grazes.
No kids seen all adults.
Highly recommend as it‚Äôs in good location and easy to get bikes/cars from. They also rent out bikes.","We were staying here for a week. First room was on the ground floor and was quite dark and humid. But when we asked, they changed our room for the one on third floor which was nice, light and cozy. Bathrooms and bedlinen are clean. (I would recommend to change towels)
Staff is friendly and helpful. We also rent scoopy here with good price for 5 days. Swimming poll is shared but almost no guest used it. Its not big but clean.
There are restaurants, cafes, market and pharmacies around the hotel. You need a motorbike to reach beach.","Sarang Comfort is exactly what it says it is. Very clean, comfortable and peaceful. You can smell how fresh and clean the hotel is as you walk to your room. Having a clean place is very important to me hence why we booked Sarang.

We rented one of the King lofts for a week and really enjoyed having a little living room area with high ceilings and a desk and king bed upstairs.

The sheets, towels and curtains were all clean. The bed was very comfortable. There were two AC units. The bathroom was small but had what you needed. The closet rack and TV cabinet were useful for storage.

Loved the view on the 4th floor for sunset and playing pool. We did our yoga there and it was very peaceful. The pool downstairs is very refreshing. The staff are very welcoming, always smiling and helpful. The two furry guards are very good boys.

Lots of great restaurants around. Very close to an outdoor food court.","Great and clean hotel.

Is especially good for medium to long stays with excellent facilities (pool, pool table, chill out space, good wifi etc‚Ä¶)

It is down an alley way with food options nearby, pharmacy, money Change etc‚Ä¶

- Dirty spots on towels & bedsheets;
- Unpleasant mold smell in the room;
- Unpleasant smell from the air-conditioning;
- Ants all over, even find out I took them with me in my luggage..;
- No space for luggage, we were with 2 persons and we didn't got any space left;
- Only 2 seats to chill downstairs at the pool;
- Loud metal stairs, so when people come home late they'll wake you up for sure;
- Dogs barking all night long;
- Doors don't close properly, so insects come in easily;

Conclusion, I would definitely not recommend.. It's too expensive for what you get. We payed ‚Ç¨15,- a night, but for less money we had much better stays all over Bali!","Giving props to the staff, helpful, and quick. Location wise is near to good restaurants and cafes, perhaps this factor makes the room quite pricey for a month value.
However there are a few things that I would like to point out:
- Do not stay on room E as it is next to the AC blower (I had to use my earplugs in order to sleep)
- The towel rack provided but only one for 3 rooms, that means the guest needs to share. Logically it is so uncomfortable to share things that you need to hang dry with other strangers.
- I love dogs but the dog in front of the establishment is too noisy, they are constantly barking at 12 am - 3 am. üò≠
- The room is not that great, please do not use Stella Orange room freshener for the room, it‚Äôs giving taxi ambience (I felt dizzy so I just put the freshener in the side table)
- For the management please check or clean the drainage regularly, I experienced maggots coming out from it (BUT thankfully the management handle it quite fast).","The room has no windows and the door has to be kept closed because there are people walking all the time.  As a result, mold forms in the bathroom and there is a very unpleasant smell.  Furthermore, the sheets and pillowcases were covered in stains and smelled very unpleasant.  Even if the accommodation is cheap, I expect at least some cleanliness. The air conditioner did not work very well. The only positive thing was the pool.","This place is good for the price and location. Shared kitchen area with water refill and pool. I liked the concrete aesthetic. I would say cleanliness is somewhat questionable, but it‚Äôs not too bad. Lots of construction going on outside, but that‚Äôs probably everywhere in canggu.

This isn‚Äôt a vegan or vegetarian restaurant but they do have vegan options, which is great! I got a hot oat latte. It was decent cup of coffee; I believe there was more than 1 shot of espresso inside üòä.

I ended up getting the avocado toast, which was lovely. There was scrambled tofu and tomatoes on top.

The staff were lovely. I instantly felt welcomed. She was also great when I was ordering; she made sure if I was able to eat gluten.

I‚Äôd recommend coming here if you‚Äôre in the mood for a peaceful atmosphere. There is also outdoor seating","Great place! Good food and coffee. Chilled atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and available.

It‚Äôs also a nice place to work on your laptop for a while. Would recommend!","Want to eat a dessert and looking on Maps : cafe nearest from me, find this place and came here. So, it's my first time been here.

I choose carrot cake and it was really good! For the beverage i ordered charcoal latte and it taste plain on my tongue, i asked a simple syrup to sweeter my latte but still plain (this why i just gave 4 star).

Will come again soon to taste another menus. Well, worth a visit.","First time I've been here.  Lovely relaxed atmosphere. Indoor and outdoor seating.  Good service with a smile.  A menu that takes a moment to digest as it lends itself to the healthier style of eating. But what great and tasty food it is.  From the lentil soup/stew, to the humungous chicken burger and the beautifully cooked salmon.  Only slight let down was the popcorn shrimp.  A little doughy. And the fries. Otherwise well worth a visit."

Everything we had was SO good and the staff is SO friendly. We went three times in one week because it was so delicious. It‚Äôs a bit more expensive than most places in Bali but the quality of the food is absolutely worth it! Would recommend the burrata, salmon and the pizza (burrata) üçï","Great food and service.

I had the 4 cheese pizza and tried the octopus too.

Service was definitely the highlight. All the staff were attentive and generous. We were well looked after during the 3hrs we were in the restaurant.","Fantastic food and lovely setting with nice music. Some of the best pasta I‚Äôve ever had in Bali - Al dente, perfectly sauced and flavoured. Great Americano cocktail as well!","Overall all we are happy with the service, food and most important is the staff very genuine and reliable enough to help us with the menu and wine selections.

We came for early dinner, ordered the spaghetti carbonara and seafood. Im happy with my carbonara spaghetti and the four cheese pizza.

Love the ambience and the environment, not too noise even though it's located the main road.

I definitely will come back for the best homemade pasta‚ù§Ô∏è

It‚Äôs such a magical place, with the nicest people working and staying there. I improved my surfing in such a short amount of time, while meeting so many kind and loving people. The place in Bali is perfectly located, the rooms are so clean with every day cleaning, everyone is really sweet and caring. So BIG THANK YOU to the entire Solid Team for this great experience! I will definitely come back ","I‚Äôll start with my favourite part about Solid: The surf lessons. These are great and the school instructors really are the best part of the whole experience. They are experienced teachers, who will teach you how to surf while providing a very cool environment where you‚Äôll definitely have lots of fun. The surf classes take place every morning (except on Sundays) and they usually last around 3 hours. So you really spend all morning at the beach, and then you have the afternoon to yourself (although the house also offers some activities that you can join). This can be quite unpredictable, but from the time I spent there, I also found that the people that choose to stay at solid were all super friendly and approachable. Meeting so many great people was also one of the highlights of this experience. Participating in the weekly bbq that they have on Saturday night was the best way to get to know everyone, so I highly recommend for you to book your stay to include at least one Saturday night.
There are some aspects regarding the rooms themselves and the organisation that I feel could have some room for improvement, but really simple things that definitely would not prevent me from coming back. So, overall, the experience was memorable and I would love to come back one day. If you‚Äôre travelling solo, you should really consider staying here for some days.","It‚Äôs not easy to find a place where you can learn to surf and at the same time feel a connection with the people around you. This place has a very familiar atmosphere and not just for the house itself (there are 2 but really close to each other) but also for the people inside.
Even if it could be difficult to get known yourself, they are really nice and helpful and once you get here, you just don‚Äôt wanna leave anymore.

The surf lesson are good, they usually go to Kuta beach but you will be followed almost one by one from an instructor, the team is very international with different surfing backgrounds and this helps a lot also for learning.

The room is simply amazing, I stayed in the cabin and once you get there it seems to be a paradise, very clean and well located.
Quiet during the night.

But trust me, what will make the difference are really the people you will meet here (particularly the surf instructors who are opened to share their life and experience) .","I had an amazing time at solid surf camp, it‚Äôs a great place to learn to surf as the instructors are so helpful in the water and also after with the video analysis and theory lesson. The included breakfast was great with lots of options. I would definitely stay here again!","Absolut legends!
The staff is competent and always friendly and happy to help. The surf instructors make you get waves in a few days and are themselves locals who know their territory. I never slept in a better bunk bed. Most important is the special vibe. You arrive and instantly feel home and found 10 new friends. Make sure you stay for the BBQ night;)
Share the vibe, share the love, stay solid guys!"

Generally clean. Bathroom was a bit outdated, but other than that there was little to wish for. Very nicely located with plenty of restaurants and shops nearby.
Pool was nice. Personnel was very friendly and helpful. All in all, I would definitely recommend for a reasonably priced private room.","The rooms are spacious, modern and clean. But I wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying here long-term, as they can just rent your room to someone else who paid upfront and kick you out.
They literally told me 3 DAYS before my rent expired that I can‚Äôt extend! And I was staying there for 2 months already. This is NOT NICE to say the least.","I lived there for 3 weeks and enjoyed it so much. Specially the breezy air when I sat in front of the room. The pool is clean and facing a small garden managed by the property. The management team is also super friendly and very helpful. Room is very clean, and the tv channels also has lots of variety. You won‚Äôt regret staying there. Best bang for the bucks.","I really enjoyed my time at Kusuma.  It was nice and clean. The cleanest place I've found in Canggu so far.  The hotel is down a gravel driveway, but don't be fooled, it's an oasis.  There is currently construction going on at the end of the gravel driveway across from the hotel and the construction hours are all week from 8am-6pm.  I had room #9 which is a room further away from the construction and I slept well although the bed was a bit firm.  The construction is closer to the pool area.  The hotel has good amenities and offers laundry service and transportation.  It's within walking distance to some very good cafes.  It is a bit of a walk to the beach (around 20 minutes), but if you take a bike you'll be there in no time.  The best part about the place was the staff.  They were very nice.  I left my earrings behind and they found them and returned them to me.","Room is ok, but very noisy"

There wasn't enough bathroom towels in the room. The room was a bit dark, because of the dark wooden design. The staff was a bit uninterested with customers.

Nestled in rice paddies you feel totally immersed in nature, yet still can enjoy Canggu as it is centrally located. The beds are so comfortable and the staff, attentive and kind. I highly recommend it. I will be coming back! Thank you for a wonderful stay üôè","We enjoyed our stay at bajalo so much! It‚Äôs clean, cozy and so quiet !! Gave us a break from the city. Employees are so nice and the place is so pretty. The pool is a perfect place to rest and enjoy the beautiful plants all over the place. Location is less than 10 minutes walk from restaurants, bars and shops. Highly recommand","A very nice hotel off a small lane (hence away from the busy traffic), with beautiful rooms and friendly staff.

The only downside is that during both nights of my stay, I got woken up at 5am by loud Muslim prayers (I assume there is a mosque next door?), so if you like to sleep a bit longer that's something to consider."
