The rooms were clean, hot water in the shower and also very quiet. I slept so well.

The staff were really helpful, with the host giving us a lift to Kintamani when we left so we could grab a taxi more easily. The guide who helped us climb Mount Batur was really friendly and even taught us some Indonesian!

Had a really great stay, thanks so much :)","I can put 10/10 Very friendly owner, care about  all our wishes and gave a large room.  Rooms are clean, service is good.  We didn‚Äôt even have to look for a cafe, the hotel cooks everything and it‚Äôs very tasty.  The Internet is good, the view of Batur is amazing.  Only one thing I didn‚Äôt quite like was how the towels smelled after use.  If this moment is corrected, then everything will be perfect.","This place amazing with a view to the volcano straight from your bed!
With a amazingly helpful and friendly host. They also arrange transfer to other destination and have also scooter rental. My absolut recommendation is the sunrise volcano tour! Much better than  the usual other touristy location. No better place to relax and enjoy the island.",Excellent experience here. We booked My Batur hike with the hotel and one or their staff brought us up. They offer different yours also so much better experience than booking with a group elsewhere. Great feel about this place and really easy to meet other people around the fire pit in the evening looking at My Batur under the starts.,"You should stay here if you want to have sunrise trekking at Mt. Batur. A perfect place to stay with a view of Mt. Batur from your room. Nicely decorated both exterior and interior. They also fire pit. Not to mention the staffs friendliness üëçüèºüëçüèº, perfect!"

Too bad other facilities and amenities were not well-maintained.
1. The zipper for the camp was broken pretty badly
2. The water boiler in our camp didn‚Äôt work, luckily we could borrow one from other camp.
3. Door handle for bathroom and toilet were both broken, it‚Äôs pretty concerning if you‚Äôre staying alone since you need someone to watch the door from outside.

Overall, it was pretty nice but be prepared for those things mentioned.
Oh and do be careful since the road that google map picked for you was challenging (if you happen tp drive alone, since there are lots of extreme turns and elevations.)",Worth place to retreat with friends/couple. Has small canteen to buy some coffee/tea/noodle. Has large parking area. Recomended to come by motorcycle/small car,Good view,Nice to night,Nice viewüòç
