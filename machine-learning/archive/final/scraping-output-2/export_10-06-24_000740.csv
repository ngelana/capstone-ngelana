The view as you can see is unique and amazing with direct view to rice fields.
The food is a buffet and we found the food tasteless. To the final price the added a 20% service charge, in our opinion we ended up paying way to much for it way it has to offer for food service.

Advice: if the do better with food the place is definitely worthy!!","The place has a nice view of the rice fields. That's it. The food is ok, way overpriced. Many agencies tour stop by, it seems like a tourist trap. If you don't care about the all-you-can-eat buffet you can save some money and ask for a menu a-la-carte and save circa 50k per person.","I stumbled on this place looking for somewhere to eat with a view of Mount Agung. And it's a hidden treasure!! I wasn't aware it had accommodation when I asked Google for a restaurant near Mt. Agung. Beautiful, quiet, serene, I would like to stay here a few days. I only had a light lunch, soto ayam, nasi and watermelon juice, but all were nice.  The staff all smiles and polite. Recommend if you want to get out of kuta , seminar and even ubud.","Nice location, great view.
Food is local, so don't expect something incredible ale specially at breakfast.
Internet is only in restaurant, but very-very slow, so can't work from this hotel. So pity.","I checked out the restaurant. Buffet food was ok.
Views were amazing over looking the rice field and mountain"

You Will Amaze.., limited parking area but they manage well.","Had lunch, order chicken satay, mujair goreng, crispy duck, ice tea, choco latte, orange juice. the meals were good.
They also have yoga class & rooms too. Suitable for relaxing (no tv & area is secluded)
Have a great view (if the sky is clear)",Awesome restaurant located at a very beautiful location. You can see the beauty of Mt Agung and sip a coffee in a background of rice terraces.,Stopped for a coffee and a beer. Overpriced‚Ä¶ but the beautiful view still made it worth it :),"We visited the restaurant in August 2023. Our taxi driver had got us here for breakfast.
While the views are good, the breakfast is strictly average and compared to the other breakfast buffets(around 6 restaurants) I had in Bali, this would be the lowest rated one.
Avoid the breakfast buffet and go just got some light food or snacks to enjoy the view.
The food is certainly not their forte.
Even in the buffet, the staff wasn't replenishing the items that were getting over."
