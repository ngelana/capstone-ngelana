Best vegan feed in Bali with such affordable prices. Don't come too late although it says open till 7pm because most of their Nasi campur dishes runs out by 1.30pm. The Bakso and Mie goreng are excellent too! Terima kasih banyak banyak. Nanti jumpa lagi!,"Came here after the waterfall. Not the prettiest of all places, but this is Indonesia and places like these should not be overlooked. We had a bit of everything and it was so delicious! I recommend all vegetarians to come here as everything is so flavourful. Me and my partner got the brown snack as seen on picture, we weren't sure what it was but it was vegetarian, the owner assured us. It was a vegan pork scratchling. SOOOO GOOD!!!","One of the best experiences with vegetarian food in Bali. Food is very tasty and cheap as in warung. If you don't care about environment come and try üòã

We took, basko soup, fried rice, 9 satay, 2 tea = 73K","I really struggled to find a good vegan shop that provides authentic food with affordable price in Ubud. I kept searching on Google Map and found this place. There are a variety of dishes, my favorites are the stir fried fake chicken, sweet and spicy tampeh and green veggies. I picked around 5 types of dishes and a portion of rice but it costed only 30rupiahs in total. Food is tasty, not plain like many other vegetarian places. Highly recommend!","1. The best pure vegetarian (without onion and garlic) varung in Bali!
2. Very difficult find tasty food in Bali, there are mostly plane - without any taste. In ""Maharani"" you will find tasty dishes;
3. Prices reasonable. One buffet plate (limited) - 35000 IDR."
