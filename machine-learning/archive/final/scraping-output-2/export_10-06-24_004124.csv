The villas were lovely and the hotel grounds were well-kept and beautiful. The staff were always nice and helpful. The breakfasts were large and fill up your belly for you to begin your day.

The location is quite ""isolated"", and you do need a car or a motorcycle to get to points of interest, but if a place away from the hassle of Bali is your cup of tea, then this is the place for you.","Large rooms with extra extra large outside bathroom complete with pond and fish.
Slightly outdated furniture.
Staff are polite and willing to help.
Town is within walking distance and have some nice coffee shops.
Hotel provides good guided walks and occasional performances by local dances.
Nice place to relax.",It's a simply beautiful resort with Balinese village ambience located at Tabanan area. The staff service is excellent. They served guest from the bottom of heart. This resort with rice fields view is very good location for healing and refresh your mind.,"Had a such nice & refreshing experience to stay here. it’s perfect to you find relaxing villa to stay with a big room and bery traditional balinese villa. and love the bathroom also! it’s super enjoyable. we had such a great activity that you can book such as cycling, yoga, and cooking class. will be back sure to stay in tabanan❤️","The view is amazing but the facilities are not clean at all, some rest of bed bugs in the bed, saw a rat twice in the bathroom…"

Sadly I cannot find nasi uduk on the menu. Loving the jadoel vintage indonesian vibe, not only the decorations also consistent plays vintage-type of music Nona Ria. Oh, and white coffee is good, exceed my expectation, thought it was gonna be Luwak White Coffee, turned out it's coffee plus milk.","Good food, good place, comfy for breakfast/lunch. They have tasty yellow rice with mix vegetable & shredded chicken in Balinese red sauce, and especially the fried shallot sambal (sambal embe) is my favorite one! >> Also the crispy sweet tempeh!!!!
They have several menu besides the yellow rice, white rice, brown rice, lime leaves rice and also there're few options to mix.. such as Cakalang (fish), Gulai Ayam (a traditional Indonesian dish of chicken cooked in a spicy, rich, yellowish, curry-like sauce), ayam madu (honey chicken) and so many more...
However not all menus are available everyday! If you're lucky you could have your favorite one... One day, I found all menus are available, the other day, I'm missing few items ~
but taste is pretty good, that's why I keep coming back.
If you order thru Go-jek or Grab-food, perhaps you'd better tell the driver to call/text you back what are available..so you get the right one, especially if you know what you loves!","A must visit if you happens to be in the area. Their basic Package is super affordable and you can add more items as well as your Sambal selection.
Recommended.","I love this spot so much! The food is delicious, the interior is so modern & clean and the guys working there are so friendly! A place I visit every time I’m in the area and you should too!","Nasi kuning dan nasi uduknya enak banget

Well recommended if you want to try nasi kuning for breakfast or lunch.

Reasonable price start from 15k"
