If you happen to be around the area I recommend taking the time to visit this beautiful place - if not for the jewelry it is worth the visit for the wonderfully constructed buildings and the nice garden!
We were greeted with a cool welcome drink and got an introduction in the history of the brand as well as an explanation of all the products. I ended up getting a bracelet as a nice daily reminder of the good time we had during our vacation on the island üòÄ","As a long time John Hardy fan, I was so excited to learn that we could visit the workshop and showroom while here in Bali. We were greeted with a welcome drink and were shown a short video. Then we were able to see a bit of what goes into making a classic John Hardy piece. John Hardy and his group of artisans are passionate about preserving the Bali lifestyle and traditions. It is reflected both in the jewelry design and in their effort to preserve the landscape and give back. Purchasing a piece from their bamboo collection plants a bamboo tree. The landscape around the workshop is beautiful and delicate, as are the staff working here; kind and helpful. I‚Äôd recommend stopping by if you are in the area.","We came without a booking and were very lucky there was no-one booked in to visit the workshop at the same time. They provided us a wonderful  guide - Putri, who took us on a very interesting and informative walk around their workshop and boutique. She had excellent English, was very erudite and interesting to speak with. The experience was short and sweet and very interesting for an average western tourist. At the boutique you are given the opportunity to purchase their exquisite jewellery at a discount price. I recommend visiting this place for experience, but give you a fair warning, if you don't buy anything - your significant other may eat your brain for some time after this visit hahah",What an amazing place.  Our guide Lisa walked us thru their process and you will certainly appreciate how much work and how many steps it take to make a piece of jewelry. Truly a craft.,"I went there without knowing the brand, just to visit the workshop and I must admit that the experience exceeded my expectations. Initially I was impressed with the kindness of the people who guided me in the shop, their continuous smile, their care and attention to my needs. I took some time to admire the amazing design of the shop which is blending so well with the nature around it. Combined with the interior design,
the products in the shop made me feel like I was walking in a jewelry museum, the unique designs are a proof of the talent and passion of the people working there.
Even though I loved the products in the shop, the tour of the workshop is what I appreciated the most, I would definitely recommend it if you have one hour to spare. The happiness of the people in the workshop, their enthusiasm, the joy of creating together something special was so visible. After walking around with my wonderful guide that explained every step of the creation process and understanding how much manual work and how many hands and hearts are touching every piece, I value even more the products that I bought. Thank you for the experience and see you soon!"

I cannot recommend the sayur urap enough - it‚Äôs beyond flavourful, and delicious to add with any other dish.
We ended up trying several items on the menu and my partner stresses that this is the best nasi campur that they have had in all of Bali.","A very cozy and beautiful view for dine in. There are so many place you can choose to enjoy your food. Indoor, outdoor, gazebo, etc. The food taste good. I recommend you to try the honey grilled chicken (ayam bakar madu). The dessert also good. I choose pisang coklat with strawberry ice cream. Good place, good service.
