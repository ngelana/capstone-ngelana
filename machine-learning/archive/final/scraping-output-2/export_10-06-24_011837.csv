ChIJf6d0f5Nb0i0Rq_tEZeZB_Nc,Melasti Beach Ungasan,-8.8477419,115.1606704,"Indonesia, Bali, Badung Regency, South Kuta, Ungasan, Unnamed Road",https://maps.google.com/?cid=15563386870082894763,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.8,19752,,"the location is not far and not too crowded. the beach is clean, we didn't see many trash around. but there are quite a lot small stone and shells so must be careful when walk along the beach or when you play in the water especially if barefoot. the view is stunning. the water is clear. many people play water and swim in the shallow part of the sea. whenever sea is in low tide, there are natural barrier between the shallow water and the sea, so it is safe to swim because the high wave hit the barrier and go back to the sea. the ambience is peaceful and we were so happy just sitting around and feel the sea breeze",Nicely made beach with parking right in front of the beach. The place has many sitting area for families and friends to enjoy the beach activities and have a lovely picnic. They also have two private beach clubs with no minimum charges which is good to grab drinks and enjoy infinity pools facing the beach. The place is in south of bali hence no good sunsets. But the weather is really pleasant and chill.,"Melasti Beach Ungasan is a stunning beach in Bali, boasting soft white sand, clear turquoise water, and dramatic cliffs framing the scene. It's no wonder it consistently receives high ratings. However, to give you a fully honest and real review, there are a few things to consider:

The good:
Beautiful scenery: The beach itself is breathtaking. The combination of the white sand, clear water, and cliffs creates a picture-perfect postcard scene.
Great for swimming: The water is generally calm and clear, making it ideal for swimming and enjoying the waves.
Developing infrastructure: Compared to the past, the access road to Melasti Beach has improved significantly, making it easier to reach. Additionally, several beach clubs and restaurants have opened up, offering various amenities and dining options.
Photogenic spot: The beach is a popular spot for photography, especially during sunsets, offering stunning backdrops for capturing memories.

The not-so-good:
Limited shade: With minimal natural shade options, be prepared to bring an umbrella or rent one from the beach vendors.
Can be crowded: The beach's popularity can lead to larger crowds, especially during peak season and weekends.
Limited public facilities: While some beach clubs offer amenities like changing rooms and showers, public facilities like restrooms may be limited, especially outside the club areas.
Descent can be challenging: Reaching the beach involves descending a long flight of stairs (around 500 steps). This can be difficult for individuals with limited mobility or those traveling with young children or elderly people.

Overall:
Melasti Beach Ungasan is undeniably beautiful and offers a great experience for swimming, relaxing, and enjoying the Balinese scenery. However, be aware of the potential downsides like limited shade, crowds, and the descent before you go. If you're looking for a secluded and quiet beach experience, Melasti Beach might not be the best fit. But if you're okay with these factors and prepared accordingly, you're sure to have a memorable time at this stunning beach.","The approach road to this beach is amazing specially from White Rock Beach Club side. Clear and pristine beach having few of amazing beach clubs like White Rock, Karma Kandara and Sunday beach club. Amazing place for photo shoots as well and great for swimming as well.","üö∂ I walked down to the beach, but it‚Äôs quite steep and about fifteen minutes, so please be careful if you struggle with mobility. Definitely opt for a car.

üèùÔ∏è The beach is mostly rocky, but it‚Äôs still pretty. There is a little outcropping where you can stand to get photos, and there is an unmarked area which juts out to form the southern most tip of Bali. Definitely visit!

üçπ The beach clubs are obscenely expensive, with one asking for 250k for a seat. Nope. I went to Minoo which was okay, but for example, a coke was 60k as opposed to 10k in stores.

üöï Don‚Äôt fall for the taxis, they will over charge you and Grab works just fine at the bottom despite what they say.

üì∏ Please be aware that I was approached by lots of Muslims girls and boys who wanted a photo with me. I was not at all offended and was happy to do so with a big grin on my face, but please be aware of this before going if you‚Äôre uncomfortable in photos. However, conversely, please be kind and patient with them because they were all so lovely."

The portions are huge, the flavors are INSANE, and the prices are on point!","We ended up paying 1.5mil for two here while seeking refuge from a sudden downpour. Had so much to eat n drink. The food taste was generally satisfactory, and we enjoyed the double trouble pasta.

The club pool was nice. The added convenience of a secure area to leave our belongings while we head down to Melasti beach was a plus. Service was good.

The staff there were super friendly and helpful, always there to lend a hand (or recommend a killer cocktail). Speaking of cocktails, theirs were on point, but honestly, the real MVPs were the food.  We tried the brisket and burgers, and let me tell you, our taste buds did a happy dance. Huge portions, delicious flavors, and all at a decent price. You can't beat that!

Plus, the view? Amazing. Just stunning beach scenery everywhere you look. And the music? Totally bumping! Great energy with strong beats that just make you wanna move.

Overall, if you're looking for a fantastic beach club experience, Tropical Temptation is the place to be. It's perfect for beach bums and anyone who needs to unwind and soak up some good vibes.","Beautiful area, can not fault how breath taking the venue is, I however felt like it was definitely overpriced, poor service  as I had to ask for things multiple times before our table got them. The guy who served us after a change of staff definitely bumped the rating a Star up. Security could have done a  better job at handling people who were way too drunk instead of leaving them to get worse before kicking them out.","Tropical Temptation is a beach club gem! üíé The staff is amazing, providing incredibly kind and helpful service.

This traditional dance, performed at sunset, created a mesmerizing atmosphere as the rhythmic chants of the dancers and the dramatic setting sun combined to tell a powerful story from the Ramayana.

The location on Melasti Beach added a magical element to the performance, with the sound of the waves complementing the dancers' chants. The natural amphitheater of the beach allowed every seat to have a clear view of the performance, ensuring all attendees could fully immerse themselves in the spectacle.

The Kecak Dance itself is a visual feast, with a large group of performers creating a lively, pulsating circle around the central fire. The dance is not just a performance but a spiritual experience, reflecting the rich cultural tapestry of Bali.

For anyone visiting Bali, this experience is a must-see. It‚Äôs not just about watching a dance; it‚Äôs about feeling a part of Bali‚Äôs soul. Highly recommended for an evening of cultural immersion and scenic beauty.",One of the best experience to watch this dance show. This is based on Ramayana Story. They work very hard to show you the story. Entrance ticket for 2 was Approx. Rs. 1500/- i booked it online via klook. The timing of the show is from 6 pm to 7pm. You have to arrive early to get the best seat may be around 5pm. It has a good sunset view too.,Wow! Amazing experience!

I got my ticket early (2 hours before the show) which meant I didn't have to wait in line and got a seat I liked.

But there is a big problem, Grab-drivers are not allowed to enter the beach level (the road and the entrance ticket counter is on the hill, and it is very steep and high) to pick-up (only drop-off). There are a lot of illegal taxi drivers there, people not authorised that spend all the day there waiting for the moment tourists face the impossibility to go away, and there are a few authorised taxi drivers, but they don't use taximeter but they brag fixed rate (to reach the pick of the hill is 100k).
