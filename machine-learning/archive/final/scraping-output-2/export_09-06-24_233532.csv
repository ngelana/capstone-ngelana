Really convenient for chilling and watching the sunset. The staff are really nice and helpful. We hired a scooter and it was good. The food is yummy. The rooms are really spacious and the bathroom is nice.
The pool area is nice and it's quiet, your own little paradise. Would definitely stay here again","Great mini resort to stay a few nights, consists of 5 spacious bungalow/ villa s . Small swimming pool. Amenities are basic, bring your own toothbrush . Restaurant offers simple food, good value. 7 minutes walk to crystal bay beach. Bit of a drive from the fast boot pier( +/- 40 minutes by car) Take note name is changed to crystal bay villa & residence by astiti penida resort","Whilst we explored the West Side of the island we decided to stay close to Crystal Bay so that we can fully enjoy it. This guesthouse (not really a resort / spa but ok) was just 10 minutes away by foot from the beach and there are no hills as you walk towards the beach. The hotel staff were some of the nicest people that we have met in Indonesia. Very sweet and ready to help all the time. The place was really clean and they did the beds every day and washed the room as well. They did not change the towels, but I noticed that it was the case in all hotels that I have stayed in Indonesia l. So it could be a culture or guesthouse thing.

The place also has a very nice pool that one can enjoy at any time of the day.

The roads to this place are quite rough. Better go with a private driver. And watch out for the monkeys and other wildlife in the area. The animals are harmless but they will show up when you least expect them.","Big room and bathroom, the location is quiet and the road to get to the accomodation is actually really bad. The staff is very friendly and kind! The hotel is a 5-10 minute walk to crystal beach which is great!

If you take a shower, you have to be quick because the hot water ends within a couple of minutes.

The breakfast was ok but could be more extended.","To call it a resort and spa might be a stretch. However it's an amazing location, it's quiet, close to one of the best beaches in the Nusa Islands and the staff was so sweet and welcoming. They organised an scooter for us so we could explore the island. The bungalows ate worn down but in the middle of a jungle it's pure luxury. The pool was nice and clean too."
