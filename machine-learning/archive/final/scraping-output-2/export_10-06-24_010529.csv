Furniture and toilet are old but still work just fine. When I stayed there I paid 200k/night and got breakfast also such as fried fice/fried noodles delivered to room. The staff are also nice and friendly.,"The place is having a simple Balinese home,which I enjoyed the moment. However, they need to fix some parts of the room, because mine was having many troubles like one of the floors was shaky like it's going to fall, The hot water took time to come out, The bathtub was not that clean, The bathroom was quite slippery because they only provided one doormat for it, The floorhinge was the worst. It broke but they didn't fix it. However, The receptionist was super friendly, she was really helpful and nice. The bellboys were great but they didn't have special carriage for luggages. The breakfast was great because it was in a big portion. They could take it to your room. They have a mini market on the first floor that sold many helpful stuffs.","The bathroom sucks. There's an opened bottle of beer in the bottom cabinet which leaves stinky smell, dirty floor, hot water takes time, the toilet seat is awfully disconnected. Can't turn on the TV. The desk is dusty. The room's colors are terribly limited. Room gives off bad vibe. Can't really be covered by the fortunately nice customer service.","Quite spacey room but the cleaness is really poor. The floor is dirty and mostly the bathroom is really awfull. There is no cover for drainase hole so smells like seawer. All the tiles full of dirt and spotted, all the wooden is broken and fungus. I must open the tab for 5-10 minutes for hotwater."

But not recommended for those who want Work From Cafe. The wifi speed is really reallyyy slowwwwww. Ive asked via chat about the wifi mbps they said 85mbps, when i went there it‚Äôs actually 17mbps üòÖüòÖ. and bit pricey.
Yeah, the Caramel Macchiato was good tho.

Thanks to Google Maps for showing this COZY Coffee Shop.

FOOD & COFFEE, I like the Cappucino, its a good bean.

I do like this Place, it has outdoor or small open air inside. Nice atmosphere and design. This place is clean.

Service was normal and need upgraded the speed.

Toilet is dry, no smell and clean! Keep it up!!

I reccommend this place for Family, Working, Chit-Chat and Couples.

Note : the lady owner was smart and friendly, thanks for the special price.","First of all, they have plenty parking space so don't worry. The place may looks small at the front, but they have more seats on the back. Overall the interior is clean with dominant color of white. I tried their cappuccino and I taste it not too strong, but still delicious though. Also tried their chicken rice bowl, it was nice too. Another plus point is they serve mineral water free on the glass. Even though the glass is small, but you can refill it üòÜ. Wifi's good and pretty fast. Power socket is on every table. Another coffee shop option for working üëåüèº","Place is super cute and very aesthetic! However, wifi connection was bad and food option is not wide üò¨"

My friend and I have ordered almost 3 times a week and even try dining in. Can definitely recommend to anyone who likes Nasi Padang.","Due to renovation, they moved across the street. Bigger space for car parking.

Well, food is so so. Average but not that bad. Taste like any other Padang food, so nothing special. Tad salty and expect oily food.
Also, decent price. Spent 55k because I ordered chicken and prawns.

The place isn't the cleanest so just close your eyes and enjoy the food.
No aircon, open air concept so expect the get some cigarettes blown to your face.",Their bumbu rendang is soooo gewd üòçüòçüòç.  Price is also reasonable. Worth to try!!!,"Sorry, from all nasi padang, this one is not meet my expectations üôè

Interesting...
The atmosphere hasn't changed much...

As for the noodles, the texture of the noodles here is quite different from similar restaurant noodles. This characteristic will be a differentiator for sale in the market.

Maybe you can add some sweet noodles?

The variety of drinks is quite interesting, maybe if you can add Ice Macha?

The quality of the side dishes is good.

Live music? Good. Maybe every week held would be interesting.

Thank you for reopening this place.","Atmosphere is casual but well appointed, makes me feel like what ever they going to serve me is going to be good.

And the food served here is good, the selections are staggering, my imagination of all the possible flavors don't know where to start or when it will end. It's one of those places where I can blindfold myself and still trust what ever I pointed on the menu is going to taste delicious

Venue was fine, it has outdoor seatings or indoor AC room.

Menu has many English typos (mistakes) like Oslo for Coleslaw.

Food options were very limited (but maybe because its just open for a week). Ordered Nasi Goreng, Oxtail Soup, Chicken steak. All the food came out just luke warm not hot. My oxtail soup was very bland had to add more salt and on a bit of the expensive side. Chicken steak was fine, but the vegetables, sauce and wedges were not hot.

No alcoholic beverages options.

Staff were friendly, and helpful.
