ChIJC2QgAB8g0i0ReCXXUtGXV28,Munduk asri,-8.3399086,115.2799045,"Jl. Raya Payangan, Kerta, Kec. Payangan, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80572, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=8023048186477618552,CLOSED_TEMPORARILY,+62 878-6169-8889,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.2,440,,"An affordable camping ground. This is better for young people gathering place. The view is good and also has some beautiful plants and trekking to the river. The owners welcomed us warmly and nicely.
It's unmaintained for a long time since when pandemic, so when I went there the toilet door and water filter were not in the good condition also the poor horse sculpture did not have full legs üòÅ","This place was built for all who likes to take pictures or selfies with beautifull nature backgrounds.  A giant cut-off tree trunk which has a very large roots spread over the cliff wall is the main attractive photo-spot, while the cool weather surrounds it along with the forest view from across. Stunning!

Google Map for this location is ended at the main road, then to enter the location find a huge sign board beside a small shop which will lead us to the parking lot under the shady trees.

For entrance tickets, our group of eight was charged by IDR 120,000 (includes car parking). No Guide is provided, so be careful with yourself, bring as light as possible (better if you have a backpack), because everything is at your own risk.

A cafe is provided to eat and drink at the front and flat area. It's just nice that we can choose to sit on daybed around orange trees or more convenience at the carts area or at the huts. Unfortunately,  we haven't tried the foods because heavy rain has started before. But this area is fun and relaxing.

Our experience so far, when the rains come and you are still on a cliff area, then you have to be able to go up by yourself because there is no prior announcement from the management, also no one will pick you up with an umbrella. Everything is at your own risk. In the cliff area, there is only one shelter near the track ended.

Some trash bins stood in almost every main spots, and toilet is provided near the Kitchen Cafe. But because it is in the garden area, it becomes very moist and a bit smelly in the rainy season.

This place is not suitable for old ages or children who like to run around and also disabled person because the location is on the edge of a cliff, and the main attraction is at the bottom of the cliff. To reach it, we must walk through the stairs that have been provided complete with strong enough handles.

Most of all, if you are a Selfie Queen, this place is a must visit. Enjoy!
