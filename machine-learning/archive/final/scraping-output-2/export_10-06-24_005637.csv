Nice place with great view. The waitress is friendly on first impression. Food and Drink is good. I think this place is quite new.

I just seen this placed has closed. I'm sorry.","The food is average, but the restaurant was very comfort and they have beautiful garden","This place original signature dish is sate kelinci. When I spotted the place, I just stopped and got into the restaurant.

The place itself is very cool. Very spacious, with front area facing the road, and side area is facing the flower field.

Very calm and rejuvenating. Food itself is good. Very affordable yet tasty.

Very recommended if you go on your own, with friends, couple, family or group.

A must go place.","Lovely location but food is atrocious, tiny portion and expensive! Been too hundreds of restaurants in Bali and this has to be the worst food wise I have been.If your in the area Umanyar just down the road is much better for around the same price.",Passss
