We were not sure if Google maps was really taking us to a real place until we actually found it. Though they are mainly a delivery and takeaway place, when we asked if we could dine in,  they immediately set up a place for us. We had some delicious coffee first and they even customised a pizza for me that was not on the menu. It really felt like we had been invited to someone's home for dinner. In the end, they even served us local desserts on the house. Overall, it was the best meal I had in my 11 day trip to Bali and one of my best experiences in Bali as well.",,,,
