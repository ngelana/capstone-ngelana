Kuta Sel., Kabupaten Badung, Bali 80361, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=13218883806846337421,OPERATIONAL,+62 859-5416-2641,private_guest_room,"private_guest_room, lodging",4.1,45,,"Great place to stay if you are on a budget, and you can settle without luxuries like AC and warm showers. The room and the bed was big, equipped with a fan for when it gets hot, and the internet speed was good. One of the biggest pros with this place is the calmness you get being away from the busy streets while still being located in southern Bali which was is one of my favourite areas. The property is spaceous, and the people you will meet here are awesome. Would definitely stay here again next time I‚Äôm in Bali.","We were here for one night, and maybe there wasn‚Äôt enough time to see the good things in this place, I guess the family is nice, and the place has other qualities. It doesn‚Äôt feel good to write a review like this BUT: the room was just bad.
When we entered the room I already had the feeling something is not right.
That the bed and furniture looked old wasn‚Äôt the problem, as long as the sheets look/smell clean, it‚Äôs totally fine.
It turned out the bathroom, which is a mini toilet with a small cold shower, no sink, it just stank so bad, we had to hold our breath while using it. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs urine, or some mix of chlor, bad scent they put on it to solve the problem. Well it didn‚Äôt. It was a bad night. We had to leave the fan on the whole night to not smell it thru the door, but still it came to the bed.",The hospitality of the hotel owner is excellent and always ready to help.,"I spent two weeks with Roejas beautiful family. They are always happy to help, having fun, sharing their culture and happy to learn from yours! It is perfectly located far from the crowd and noise, but super close to everything by scooter. They have laundry, restaurant and rent motorbikes as well... all for a super good price!! Roejas dad is a taxi driver in case you need a transfer or tour. I would come back and recommend it!!!!","The location is nice but the homestay itself not. I had many ants in my room.
Additionally it‚Äôs not very clean and everywhere it smells bad."

Pool is my favourite, the landscape and interior is excellent.
There's a construction behind the villa, they work in a daylight while we can go somewhere to explore Uluwatu.
Once back in the evening, all the quite is back and we really enjoy the ambiance. Sit and chill by the pool with beers.
Overall stay is super, thxüôèüèª","Cute villa in Uluwatu, near from beach and resto.
They have 2 modern house, we stay in Anasera for night. Parking lot available.
All good, little accomodation but cozy and fully furnished.
Good vibes in the evening.
I can get my sunset from here!
It was amazing stay, would definitely back!","We had our 1N stay in Shankara. It's truly a beautiful heaven, a good place to stay.
Near from Uluwatu and favorite beaches, but the location is a bit side to the hustle  of Ulu or Bingin. Recommended place if you're looking for quite and relaxing atmosphere.

Pretty house with outdoor kitchenette, great pool and cute outdoor shower. Mini garden is maintained by care.
We love the evening ambiance, with soft breeze and quite.
The sunset from here is beautifull too!","Super recommended! Little villa but very comfy, interior and exterior is made with love.
The staff is also super, very caring. He went above and beyond! Excellent service.","Be prepare to stay in an accommodation where the respect for the clients doesn‚Äôt exist at all, to wake up in the morning at 8:00 with the sound of a big jackhammer machine that is breaking stone in the back of the villa due to 2 villas that are under-construction. On the airbnb it is write that maybe you can hear some sound but with earplugs you can relax, but the sound is extremely high and you bad is shaking, is that bad. When we ask the workers if it is the same owner as the one from our villa no one answer, and they begin to look to each other, so I suppose that it is the same, as this villa is quite new. When we tried to speak with the owner of our villa the answer was: we apologize but you need to think of our community who gain the money from this, so 0 respect for the clients who pay the money to come and relax to this place. On the airbnb is write that the construction are from 8:00 to 17:00 but in fact was from 8:00 to 19:00, every day ! This was the worst experience of my life, and I‚Äôm a client that have 5 stars on booking and airbnb that never tried to make problem or not understand some exceptional situations, but this extremely bad! I don‚Äôt recommand anyone to stay at this place"
