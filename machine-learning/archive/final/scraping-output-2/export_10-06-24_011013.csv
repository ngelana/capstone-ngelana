It was an adventure we enjoyed however it’s a bit sad to see the ruins of what looks like a once beautiful restaurant and pool by the sea. It is now empty, and other than squatters there is only old dirty rain water in the bottom of the pool and rubbish and dirt on the floor. Hopefully someone will bring it back to life and return it to a place worth the title and effort to get there.","As the name implies, the place is remote. It's best not to swim because there are lots of large rocks and the waves are quite big. Suitable for simply looking for a calm atmosphere while enjoying the waves and looking at Crystal Bay in the distance","The beach is very beautiful.

But please don't swim there!!!!

Yesterday i nearly drowned, although i am a good swimmer and swam there many times before. The waves and the current are unpredictable, i wasn't able to swim back to the beach. Was very lucky to make it to the side to the rocks, where i slowly made my way out of the ocean..

The 6th of february 2024 is my second birthday now.","Perfect beach in Cennigan, its like a paradise, a lot of fish to see. Can swim in the morning to noon. Later high tide. Some people advise not to swim, but its ok in the morning. We have spent couple of hours under water, really nice.","Really cool beach and is nice and secret, easy walk, can even have a look at the abandoned resort which is kinda crazy."

The food was fantastic, so much so that we ate there twice in the short time we were on Nusa Lembongan. The owner and chef are super friendly. We felt very comfortable. The wonderful atmosphere of the restaurant contributed to this. Thank you very much!","My husband, 2 teens and I had a great night here. The family who own and run the warung were so welcoming and friendly, and we interacted lots with their cute kids. The food was great and it was a great price. I had a bit of an upset tummy from earlier in the day and they made me chicken soup, which was just what I needed, whilst the rest of the family had Indonesian food or burgers. Afterwards they offered to scooter the teens back to our accommodation, so we didn’t have to do shuttle runs, which was so kind!",This was a little gem we came across whist doing a moped tour around the island. Feels like your up on the hills in a little farm. This is helped by the nice cow wandering around next door. Food was delicious and had a really nice family vibe.,I went to this beautiful restaurant and the location is absolutely gorgeous. The owner is really friendly and the food was delicious. I ate the fish fillet burger.,"Just wonderful.

Drinks: delicious fresh fruit juices made directly behind you in the yard, watermelon was our favourite and we couldn’t resist taking the dragonfruit juice as well.

Starters: we took the bruschetta and the calamari/onion rings and that would have sufficed as a meal by itself. The tomorrows in the bruschetta were super soft and sweet, and the batter around the calamari and onion was delicious (not super thick as we Europeans are used to, it was perfect)

Main course: my mother took the pork ribs, they were absolutely delicious. The meat fell directly of the bone, they were that moist and perfectly cooked. 5 ribs, a small portion of fries and a small salad was everything she needed for her satisfactory meal. My sister and I took the pad Thai, perfectly spiced and just wonderful.

Ambiance: super sweet restaurant, where the benches are made from the inside of the boats you see by the water. The place is a little isolated which allows you to enjoy the jazzy music and the sounds of nature.

Thank you for such an amazing night with friendly staff."

Not sure if people have insanely high expectations and are expecting a 5 star resort. Stayed here two nights and wish we could have stayed longer. View is incredible from every room. Staff was as nice and accommodating as could be. Didn’t want to leave. IMO the best place to stay on the the island. The view was unbeatable. So very impressed. A couple hiccups such as water turning off in the middle of the night and ac in one of our rooms not being as cold as it could be but would recommend this place to anyone !! Do yourself a favor and stay here. Just don’t expect a 5 star resort and you’ll be pleasantly surprised !!!!,"Awesome place far away from noisy harbor. In the Morning the Beach is complete empty. No swimming because of the strong current, but nice pool.
The rooms are awesome with a stunning view. Highly recommended to stay there for some days in paradise.","Astonishingly great!!!! Although I were not there for my honeymoon, I would certainly recommend this place for newlyweds!!! Free WI-FI, a Bar that were open and considerate to their guests. Loved the scooter ride to the hotel...its a adventure on its own. The Hotel took extra care in escorting us to the hotel from the boat....they were so wonderful !! I made life long friends from the hotel staff. In Short, you will see me here again for sure...","The Secret Beach itself is very dangerous and tricky – do not swim too far from the shore! The current here is extremely strong. I was almost washed out in the ocean by the strong current.

The bar is nice but way too expensive. Probably, the most expensive place at the island.","Beautiful Hidden gem. Personaly, i do love this villa much. Located in corner of Ceningan island and its offer private beach as the name secret beach. You need to rent scooter like 100K to get here. For you who outside guest, you need to pay 30K to enter the beach. I feel so private and so intimate since this villa at secluded area. The villa room so huge with 2 storeyed. The room facing to the beach so its trully wake up goals. On the night, you even can heard the ocean brezze. But be careful when swimming in high tide, ridiculously dangerous."

I did buy the ceviche and it was a big disappointment. It only had tomatoes and onions with the raw fish. I asked for lime or lemon and they brought out half of a quarter of lime saying it had run out. Don't agree to serve an item on the menu if you don't have the ingredients. Then I found two bugs in the rice. Sucks to be put into a situation where you feel like you shouldn't pay for the meal. To their benefit they didn't make me pay and were very nice, but overall an uncomfortable experience.","Hotel and restaurant facing the bay, great view of Nusa Penida’s forest over the ocean. Swimming pool can be used even if you are outside guest by spending more than Rp.100k for food or drink. Serving food and drink is little slow.",This is the worst place on earth!!! The juice i took taste like pee of the fishes. And the worst thing is you have to order something if u want to go to secret beach! Seriously!!! Beach is must be public place not private place own by private villa! There's no half star in google so all i can do is just putting the one full star. Too bad!,"Lovely beach and location. A nice spot to have a drink and relax.
A little bit hard to find and the road down would be a little difficult for beginner riders","We just happened to stumble upon secret beach. When we saw the villas next to it, we decided to stay the night even though we already had a place back in seminyak. Beautiful!!!"

We wanted to start early to avoid the busiest crowds and they were happy to start at 7am. We went to manta bay, crystal bay and gamat bay and had a great experience. We were lucky to see a manta ray and the guide was fantastic, he was watching the direction of the ray so we could move away from the small crowd of people and appreciate it swimming past and under us without the crowd (who were following behind it).

We unfortunately did not see turtles but the guide did try and that is nature, sometimes you are lucky and sometimes you are not. The final bay had the clearest water we have ever seen and amazing fish to swim with.

We will definitely go on a snorkelling trip with them again on our return to Nusa Lembongan.","Great guide, great trip. They carefully explained everything and was always helpful getting us in and out of the boat",Very good experience with Iwan. We had a great time exploring three different spots. Saw different types of fish and turtles and a jellyfish. Got so many amazing photos and videos. Recommend!,The best snorkelling on the island. We arrived 1 hour earlier to the manta rays than every body else and had a whole out of uninterrupted time with 10 or more mantas. Far better than any other trip we have done on the island or anywhere in the world.,Best snorkelling experience that we have ever had! Saw so many amazing different coloured fish and coral and the water was clear and blue! The guide was very knowledgeable and accomodating and took great pictures of videos underwater on his GoPro! If we can we would definitely do it again!
