This place is not a hotel. It's considered a condominium complex. A local is sharing a room for tourists and charging double. My wife booked this hotel from the ""Agoda App"". She paid ""117,000 IDR"" then we got to the location there was some dude who spoke with my wife then he got someone on the phone who checked our reservation and then asked for more money and only pay in cash. My wife paid another ""30,000 IDR"". Please don't stay here by yourself based on other reviews. Also to note. Google Maps showing location in the wrong area to drive to this location. We drove around multiple areas to try to find the location. We even asked a local business and they never heard of this place. My wife was freaked out by the dogs roaming around the place. The wife states there was Free WiFi here. But after testing it's not fast enough to even upload vacation photos to the cloud. So I told the wife to remove herself from the WiFi for her safety. The bathroom isn't sanitary enough to go to the bathroom for a woman or take a shower for anyone. Sorry for the owner but this isn't a hotel. They are just using Google Maps as a free horrible Airbnb. Keep your money. Sleep in your vehicle if you have to.","They are thieves. After booking on agoda and I paid for 2 days after one day they said to me to check out and this price on Internet wasn't enough and it is enough for only the first day.. I already checked out after one day while my booking is for 2 days... After searching I found that this is common in Oyo hotels, you book online with a price and after going to the hotel they are asking for more... Avoid this hotel and any hotel related to Oyo","The room is reasonably nice, the price is very low, and the location is very convenient. The staff seem quite nice as well. On the downside the pool is currently out of order, there is no hot water,   no lockable storage area for luggage, and no refrigerator. Most other places I've stayed in Bali have had these amenities so that was disappointing. Overall I think the place isn't bad, but you definitely get what you pay for.","1. When we arrived, they asked us to pay 100k more which is illegal but it seems like they don‚Äôt care, they know that we don‚Äôt have time to waste.                                          2. I ordered a 1 double bed and they gave us a room with 2 separate beds.","Last time I apply oyo at Astiti hotel hali a remote one with very beautiful photos view, the actual is very very bad. I paid but prefer to cancel occupying although non refundable. And get better one similar price without oyo
Please update the photo for oyo‚Äôs benefit"

I ordered Spaghetti bolognese, smoothies bowl, chicken wings, and they were good. The staff is nice, the venue is spacious also and it has beautiful rice field view. The parking area is decent as well.","One of the nicest looking restaurants I've been too. Very open space, lots of natural lighting and you feel the air. Food was really good and presentation was spot on. Prices were a little higher than average but for the building size and decor you'll forgive. A must try when in Tanah Lot",Nice place over looking rice fields and beyond very relaxing atmosphere the food is above average nice place to relax over lunch in a cool setting to get away from the heat,"Very stylish place to dine or have a coffee, and the views are impeccable. On our first visit, we ordered a smashed avocado sandwich and a combo vegan bowl; we waited for quite awhile even though it wasn‚Äôt very busy, and when the combo vegan bowl came, we had to remind them that they‚Äôve missed out on three major components/ingredients in the dish - mushrooms, tofu and pumpkin seeds - and they had to take it away as they put it down, and when it came back, the pumpkin seeds were still missing. We would‚Äôve been ok with them just clarifying the change or lack of ingredients but there was hardly any communication.
As for the flat white, we could hear that the coffee machine (milk) steaming was overdone and sure enough when we got it the coffee was boiling. That aside, it‚Äôs an up and coming place to hang out, if they could install more fans around the upper decks and over the sofa areas that‚Äôll make it so much more comfortable for customers. All in all, looks the package but still needs improvement.
Views are stunning though, looking out to lush green rice fields, you just can‚Äôt beat it!! We wish them all the best for the future.","While it's obvious that a lot of investment has been done in making a beautiful place in a nice location and buying good reviews on Maps few days ago; we hope that the owners choose to invest in proper staff.
There were only 2 people in the place. One cook, another waiter; neither of whom understand English. They did what they could, and for that we appreciate them. The food was mediocre. Juices were ok.
What we were truly shocked to see was that there were so many good (5 star) reviews of this place- turns out they are all fake (bought) to compensate for the earlier bad reviews.
Hope the owners realise that buying fake reviews is not going to make their restaurant better and they learn to invest in proper staffing instead of online.
Your place is beautiful; but half of the menu items were not available (even though menu is already small); your staff (although try as they could‚ú®Ô∏è) is not equipped to deal with tourists; food quality needs to drastically improve- especially taste.
üôè [Please don't waste your money in buying fake reviews; kindly invest it in good efficient staff]"

F&B was slightly above average, service was a little hit-and-miss. Service was kind of slow. Prices alright.

View made it all worth it though.","The place has a very nice view and relaxing atmosphere. I must say the foods can be improved. We ordered the ayam bakar madu, bebek betutu, tuna satay, etc. The marinade can be more flavourful. The chickens were a bit dry.

I am sure if they improve the foods, this place will be a big hit.","Good foods and services. The place was clean and spacious, with the view of paddy fields.","This is the nearest restaurant to Tanah Lot bus parking lot which offers very nice view of paddy field.

We were hungry and accidentally found this place. They have quite wide parking and dining area. Even they have coffee plantations.

We ordered their signature menu Crispy Duck, Duck Fried Noodle, Satay Ayam, and Marakel. And everything was perfect, especially the duck. It was so crispy but very juicy inside. The satay also very nice with the peanut sauce. Best restaurant around here, very recommended. Keep it up. Thank you","A good spot for food before heading to tanah lot temples.

We only saw tourists there so take that as you view.","We really loved this place and grateful our driver recommended it. We toured the vegetation and then learned about the Luwak coffee making process.
Then we did a coffee and tea tasting - everything was delicious!
We stayed for lunch and got the crispy duck - it was delicious!!!!!","Very nice place to have Lunch. Duck is amazing, they have a big section of tee and coffee. I recommend the avocado coffee.","One of the best hidden gem in Bali! Will definitely come back. It‚Äôs on the way to Tanah Lot and the food is so worth it. Duck rices are around 115-125k rupiah but the portions are huge! Duck is crispy good and not smelly.

They also offer free tea and coffee testing. Such an amazing experience! The Luwak coffee is 50k/cup and the other coffee/tea is 20k/cup.

The place is so serene and nice with gentle breeze  and perfect view. Its not hot and super great to spend the day in.
