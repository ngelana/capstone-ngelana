We came on a night where a traditional ceremonial performance was on, so we go to enjoy that while we had some cocktails & dessert. If you dine in here then you don‚Äôt have to pay an entry fee also. The statues of the angels are incredible!","Lovely place. The decor is Balinese local style with various seating arrangements. There‚Äôs a also a gallery and a stage for dance performances. We came here for desserts, but they are just okay-tasting. The price is also standard and not overpriced. Perhaps we‚Äôll be back again to try their main dishes.

A very new n unique combination. Tastes good! A nice place to relax and chill.,We had wonderful birthday celebration. Raspa our waiter really did a great job setting up our table with special decorations and acted as our own personal photographer to document our night. The restaurant has the most beautiful sculptures and the set menu was well prepared. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to make a special night for a loved one

The staff went above and beyond to ensure our comfort, providing exceptional service with a warm and welcoming attitude. The amenities, including the pool and spa, were top-notch. Dining at the hotel restaurant was a culinary delight. We can't wait to return! Highly recommended.","This place was magical. Our room was so specious, very clean, we had an extra room and our bed could easily fit 4 people and very comfortable. There‚Äôs enough towels, our private pool was also very clean.
The food at the resort was great, if you‚Äôre a coffee drinker like myself, they have excellent Bali coffee they make it fresh. Breakfast buffet also great.
The staff is super friendly and quick to provide you with anything.
Overall the Resort is definitely a 5 star, highly recommend it.","Royal Pita Maha in Ubud was absolutely fantastic. This 5-star gem offers an unparalleled blend of luxury and tranquility. The beautifully appointed rooms, stunning views of the lush surroundings, and the impeccable service made my stay truly memorable. The on-site restaurant served exquisite cuisine, and the spa treatments were heavenly. Whether you're looking to relax or explore, Royal Pita Maha is  the perfect base. Highly recommended for anyone seeking an exceptional experience in Ubud!",Beautiful hideaway but it's 115 steps to the lobby so not for the unfit. The food was average but our room was spacious and air-conditioned. The bathroom was unusual. The spa bath waste of space and dangerous to walk around basins. Also the toilet smelt. The staff do their best.,"My family and I had an absolutely amazing stay here at our time in Bali. We were really sad to leave. From the impeccable service, to all the friendly faces and greetings from each and every staff member. To the beautiful views from the lobby, our villa, the breakfast restaurant, basically everywhere you look. Everything about The Royal Pita Maha just oozes peace and tranquility. Every staff member goes out of their way to make sure that you have the most comfortable stay.

The location of The Royal Pita Maha is a short drive to central Ubud (there are shuttles provided) which was really convenient.

Next time we come to Bali, we will definitely be having a longer stay at Royal Pita Maha."

We arrived at 7:30 PM and left at 10 PM. This was the worst hotel experience of our lives. They assigned us a Himalaya villa in the artist village and the room had a very bad smell. We informed housekeeping immediately after entering the room, and they sprayed, but that unbearable smell was still there even after an hour when we returned to the villa after dinner in hotel restaurant.

The hotel is not gated and lacks security; it‚Äôs in a small Ubud village where locals can walk in at any time. There were tens of locals drinking just outside the villa entrance (I bet nobody wants to stay in such an expensive villa where locals are drinking, smoking and commenting when crossing, I made a video of locals drinking and commenting when crossing)We asked reception to change the room as it was very uncomfortable with so many locals drinking outside and the unbearable smell. Additionally, we had to request a golf cart every time for transportation as hotel itself was not recommending to walk from villa to hotel reception, restaurant and pool area. It‚Äôs dark and not safe! Paid 900 euros to feel uncomfortable!

The reception guy came to the room but took no action other than offering to spray again, refusing to change the room. When we asked to cancel the entire booking, he refused. We asked him to cancel 2 nights and we stay 2 nights, he refused! The manager didn‚Äôt bother to address the issue. The reception staff kept insisting they would not refund our money. Like it or not stay that‚Äôs what they were trying to say since it was fully paid. Just want to loot tourists hard earned. I‚Äòll share my experience in German forums to ensure more German tourists are well informed about this hotel before booking.

Ultimately, we decided to leave at 10 PM as they were unwilling to make any adjustments. We had to find and book a different hotel. There was no service or hospitality, and no effort was made by the hotel to make our stay comfortable. I would not recommend this property to anyone looking for a good villa in Bali.","This hotel was fantastic! The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout my stay. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful, with a wide variety of options to choose from. The room itself was beautiful and very clean. But the highlight for me was definitely the view from the room ‚Äì looking out onto the jungle was breathtaking!

The hotel also offered a scooter rental service for 120 baht per day, which was a great way to explore the surrounding area. Overall, I had a wonderful experience at this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and relaxing stay in a beautiful location.","The view overlooking the valley was picture perfect: you truly felt you were amongst the rainforest, almost secluded excepting for the friendly local village community. The rooms were a mix of traditional and modern, full of the luxury amenities that one expects from a luxury resort, including a turn down service.
The on-site restaurant served a varied, imaginative, and excellent menu with a robust drinks selection.
The spa was incredibly relaxing with a friendly team: I had the traditional massage and face yoga, both of which I highly recommend.
There was a free shuttle to Ubud town centre, and the hotel staff are happy to help find other ways into town as it is about 25 mins or so from the hotel.
But the star of the show was the staff: extremely hospitable, kind, and welcoming. We felt really looked after and pampered. Thank you to the whole team. We will be back!","This is the most incredible place in bali , the rooms were beautiful   the amenities were great and they have the nicest staff I have ever met, they are super helpful and accommodating, they add a lot of personal touches to your stay to make it special. The food is really high quality and tastes great,  the barman his name is Made , makes incredible cocktails and ladies at the restaurant were incredible. I will be back for sure.",Wonderful honeymoon experience! 15 mins to downtown ubud. One of my favorite hotels I have ever been to. Yoga every morning at 7am. Only thing missing was more vegan options on the food.

Everything else was amasing! If I would come again I would stay at this apartment!","Very nice hotel, although it's actually more of a group of villas (the staff is not there permanently, but they are on call).
Very comfortable and spacious room, good bathroom (private outdoors bathroom). Fantastic garden, you'll feel like you are in the middle of the jungle. Beautiful small pool. Liked the breakfast, lots of options (you choose from the menu the day before).
You can go visiting tourist attractions with the Imagine Bali Tours (the guide, Eddi, is a very nice guy), or you can rent a scooter from the hotel.
Unlike what was written in another review we didn't have any problem finding the hotel, but Google Maps does suggest a route that was not the one our driver used to drop us at the hotel - after leaving the main road take the first right (very difficult corner) and then turn left when you see the hotel entrance (the streets are very narrow)."

This villa has such a magical energy and is designed with so much love. You can really feel how much love the owners put into the beauty of the details in this house. They maintain it a lot, which is not always the case on Bali unfortunately.
The garden is so beautiful! And the open living room gives you a tropical feeling. In general the garden is an absolute highlight, it is very spacious.
