We made good decision by staying there for 2 nights. Staff service is very good. Julie is so friendly. He always greeted us with smile. Deluxe room with king bed and extra cot is pretty big. We felt as if we were staying in one bedroom house. They also have paid spa and massage service. Everything was seamless.,"Stayed here for 2 days first day in the suite and next day in the villa. The only good thing about this place is the infinite pool and the view of the harbour. Starting with water they don‚Äôt provide packaged water in the room and one has to buy from the restaurant which is chargeable. Coming to the breakfast buffet which is extremely limited and same everyday, there is no vegan option in it. The villa we booked didn‚Äôt had even the basic amenities of bath robe and the water flow of the shower was also not proper. The staff is also not helpful here so you need to re-consider this place when booking.","Surprised by the bad comments I found here. The place is amazingly beautiful, located in the hill so that u can see ocean and the Agung volcano. Territory is big and well organized. All is green and clean. AC was working very good, it was even cold sometimes. Room is huge and clean, service is fast. Beautiful pool with the sea view.

Also, the location is next to all good restaurants and cafe. Totally recommend staying here","If anyone wants to stay starved and be harassed by staff can stay here . Rooms were  not clean stains all over. Bad staff behaviour. Food is worst in not eatable at all I ordered pasta which wat not cooked at all. Moreover if they want to extract money from you they will falsely accuse you of Making noodles in the kettle. Moreover they will claim this and when we asked show us cc tv they had no answers. They were telling without our permission they entered our room. I asked how n when they started telling we have duplicate keys we can enter any room they don't need your permission. Just want to extract money from tourist.
You will be starved.
You will be harassed .
Cockroaches in room.
No doors. Only a glass slider . Little to no privacy if you open curtain. No ventilation. No proper lighting in hotel.
You will have no safety of your belongings ( as they claim that they can enter any room they whenever they want)
They will steal from your room as well as I heard from another person who stayed here.
KINDLY READ ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS BEFORE BOOKING AS THEY ARE TRUE each and every review is the truth of the place.","We stayed here for 2 nights.Awesome place,ocean view from the villas.Swimming pool is huge which is impressive.Rooms and bathrooms are huge feels like really luxury.Staffs are really good and kind.Just WOW"

It is surrounded by farms and can be pretty smelly, but the worst was inside our room where we found bird poo on the floor when coming back at night.
The next morning we found heaps of bugs in our (yellow) bed sheets, we decided to leave after 1 night and went elsewhere..
There seems to be a lot of fake reviews in places in the area such as other local restaurant we tried so I doubt this hotel deserve a 4-4.5 average rating.","We stayed here for 2 days, location is almost near the harbor so it‚Äôs easy to go to snorkeling tour or to see Klingking view point,

Ordered a deep fried fish with sweet and sour sauce and a chicken fried rice. Both were delicious! Even though fried rice was at the pricey end, the taste could tell there were high quality ingredients involved.

The barbecue taste comes through nicely and when paired with the raw sambal it is just amazing..

Will be back for sure!","We visited Warung Jungle in August 2023 while visiting Nusa Penida.
We almost ordered everything available in the menu and the food was good. I was disappointed by the MeGoreng but the red snapper, prawns, calamari, mushroom soup, ice tea, mango juice and all other things we tried were good.
The staff was very friendly and helpful. One of the staff members even volunteered to help calming down the baby while we had dinner.
The service is slow but that's because food is freshly prepared. Being a Warung it's family run and very well coordinated.","nice music atmosphere, food is alright but more on the pricey side"

Will be staying at this hotel again when I coming back to Nusa Penida.","I was glad to get a room here last minute even though it was sold out online after arriving at my other accommodation booked in advance through Agoda and found it not to my liking in both cleanliness and location.
This hotel seems to be newer and cleaner. Also conveniently located right on the main road. Only issues are that you can hear road noises (but not late at night obviously) and the sliding doors for all rooms don‚Äôt seem to slide/close easily.  On top of that, a certain group of tourists, who are from a notoriously rude country, was talking so loud until almost midnight. They must have not been educated to respect others as we‚Äôve all heard.
Breakfasts, included with the room rate, are lovely and has good selection. Staff very helpful and friendly, too.
There is a warung across the street (part of a homestay) with limited food choices, and a convenience store (also run by the homestay, with expensive prices). Otherwise, you‚Äôll have to go to harbor area for everything, and the road is NOT very walkable. Better to hire a scooter from hotel and go before dark, since there are sections of road that‚Äôs winding and lack of street lights.","Clean, modern, and the best staff.

We were looking for a simple place for good price. It was a good choice for us since it is intimate, authentic and close to nature, while it is clean and has a very friendly and helpful staff.
Ellya was a super kind and helpful host with direct communication, who rapidly responded us all day. She could arrange basicly everything that you need, a very talented girl. I wish her and her husband all the best this way.","Very sweet staff, nice place.
Maybe a bit far away from stuff, so be sure to rent a scooter.",,,

The room was spacious and okay but located in the inside far away from accessibility, so you definitely need a bike to commute. Additionally the staff here is pathetic. They had a lady sitting at the reception who doesn‚Äôt understand English and had a hard time conversing. They don‚Äôt offer room service so don‚Äôt expect anything from them - even if you want a bottle of water you need to arrange your own because there is not even a single person or caretaker in the night. They have a total of 4 cottages so When we checked in we were the only ones there and in the night it was quite scary because there was no one except us. The rooms had no hot water - I think they only have smaller instant heaters so the water in the room could barely suffice for just one person to have a shower. We had our taxi scheduled in the morning and we were stranded without hot water, it was raining and quite cold and with kids i struggled managing it. Just don‚Äôt go for it because it is cheap the service is horrible. I recommend choosing places near the harbour so you have eateries and restaurants in the vicinity.","Very nice and comfortable little houses to spend your holidays. Everything was perfect, every day they cleaned the room, very attentive with the guests. I highly recommend this place. Best we had in our 2 weeks holidays in Bali.","Very friendly and accommodating people, clean and modern bungalows. Everything looks very new. Location is between the city with the port and the beaches. Very quite and still only a short way to markets, atm, etc. and to the beaches on the other side.","Best place to stay in nusa penida with location not too near to port n not far from other beach....the rooms were very nice, neat and clean nothing to complain",Its very calm and more comfortable suites.

I‚Äôm not sure if it came from the juice or the actual meal. Unfortunate regardless.","Came here for a lunch after snorkeling activity in the morning. The staff was super nice & friendly. Before settling in at the table I cleaned my feet & sandal from the sands using the water sink they provide in front of the restaurant. Didn't noticed it would make the restaurant's floor stained and wet, even though no other guest were there but I immediately apologized to the female staff that welcomed us, she politely comforting me that it was okay. Made my order and the waiting time for the food to be served was decent (it was for two people order, me & my dad) The food was served by a male staff and he was very friendly, making time to talk to us and checked on us again while the stray cat arrived and ask for some food! The cat was politely asking to us tho' and we were more than happy to share! üòÇ

We ordered fish nyat nyat, spring rolls and chicken steak. According to my dad the fish nyat nyat was delicious, he ate all the food (during our 1 week in Bali he never finished the meals) meanwhile the chicken steak and spring rolls was okay for my taste.

We had a little chit chat with the male staff after the meals that led us to booked 1 of their hotel room for one night.","Upon arriving and looking at the menu, we found that most of the items especially on the Western side were not available. The food took very long to come out and when I got my chicken pizza, it was very poor and just tasted of ketchup. The satay chicken was decent however.","Good food for Indians, We ate an indian vegetarian lunch here and it was good üòä.","Very clean kitchen and professional staff. The food menu looks amazing and the dishes well prepared. I have two critisism which I hope they will work on:
1. The Pizza Chicken only came with cheese and chicken topping, although the menu said it would have mushroom and basil. It didn't. Maybe due to shortage of supplies, but it wasn't mentioned.
2. The seafood fettuccine tasted great, but there were small broken prawns with shells on inside. Too many small shell to take out"

Thank you for good place.",We really enjoyed our stay and especially the hosts were super friendly and helpful. The rooms were really clean and the interior was pretty new. The breakfast was delicious. We would definitely recommend this place!,"It was a serene place to stay, the sunset is wonderful and relaxing from the cottages.
Ami and Tirta are wonderful hosts! We ordered food from father fields and it was delicious as well.
Great stay in nusa penida cause of Ami and Tirta! Do say hi to Jackie while you are there!","The Mungkul Cottages is one of the nicest places I've stayed. The room are very cozy, and have an amazing view. When we arrived we got a complementary welcome drink, along with helpful recommendations of the best things to do on the island. Ami and her family are extremely professional and helpful. They organized our motorbike and our laundry. Also, they served tea and biscuits each afternoon, which was a welcome treat. The food was really good. I particulary recommend the oats and muesli.
The only negative thing about our stay was leaving. The cottages are in a beautiful setting, and the customer service was the icing on the cake."

I never wrote bad review but now I feel like they laugh at me. So here the situation;
My boyfriend and I went to this place expecting having the same room as the pictures on Airbnb. Arriving there, it was two separate beds. And they told us that all of their airbnb have 2 separate beds which they never mentionned on airbnb! We decided to contact the host to find a solution. They proposed us to change airbnb and go to another place. We accept the offer. It was a bit more pricey so they send me the difference to pay. I paid 43$. 15 minutes later, the host told us that the room is no more available, she was so sorry and proposed us a FULL refund. Obviously we accepted! I received one of the refund which is the room with 2 separate beds but not the other one. They told us that it could take around 15 days to received it. 3 weeks passed, no refund. I contacted them several time they never reply or reply with : they will help me, find a solution. And then no more news for days. recontacted them again they says they are so sorry, will find a solution. No more news again. I sent them proof of my bank account showing them that I never received the refund and they never replied back. This is so frustracting. They are no professional at all and they never refunded me a room I never went.",Nuce place to stay,,,
