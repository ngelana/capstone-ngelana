Clean and well looked after. I highly recommend for any solo travelers or couples looking for a peaceful place to stay.

Spent 2 nights and would definitely come back.

Breakfast was the best I've had at any hostel or homestay in Bali so far too!","I didnâ€™t like at all, dirty, bugs everywhere, my rooms didnâ€™t get any view, if you want to cook in the dark forget because when you turn on the light too much bugs ! but the employees are very good, !","Only there for 2 night but we loved it, nice owner, nice view, good banana pancake for breakfast with Bali coffe. Good meals in warungs around for 10k to 20k. Really good to have your little house with kitchen, 2 bedroom and everything for this price.","The owners are so nice and kind. But there was usually pretty noisy, especially near the window in the bedroom, because the family was talking there all the time. I could hear the constant rooster singing there. I like this place, but I was tired of living there because I couldn't find any civilisation in that area. There was not enough air conditioning in the house, it was hot. Gojek Delivery is so high to that place. But you also can order meals from the owner for a small fee.","Good place for relaxing, watching sunset and hearing different kinds of bugs sounds. This place is middle of a village name bona in Bali. The owner of this house is so polite and helpful. Neighbors are friendly. If you like to stay in a quite place this is a good one. But this is a very simple place with very basic things. Do not expect luxury."

Maybe it was because there was an event, so the officers created a food + drink menu package for Rp. 50,000,- which visitors had to order at this time.

I chose package number 2 (fried rice and lychee tea) and hot cappuccino (when I asked if it could be made flat white, but none of the officers knew what Flat White coffee was ðŸ¥² even more the barista himself)--actually I was in the mood for coffee when I came but it's ok coz I eventually would be ordering meals later on.

The ambiance; it's semi outdoor, as they says, it feels homey, with the village vibes and nice weather probably could makes me stay longer another time.

Cappuccino could be better, i asked for a hot one and came out as lukewarm. Also bit watery to my liking.

Nasi Goreng (take away) tastes bland, portion just enough.

Ice Lychee (flavour) tea 6/10 (no lychee).

Toilet definitely needs more attention. Spider web almost around the corners. No tissue paper l.

If you're around Gianyar area, don't forget to visit and give a try. ðŸ™‚",,,,
