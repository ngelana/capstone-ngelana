You can do ‚Äúpicnic‚Äù on the ground floor, they even have picnic basket. The food could be better though, the dessert is good.
Overall great experience. Will visit again.",Beautiful place with stunning view. We came without reservation and got table on 2nd floor. Before you go there they asked you to pay 100.000 IDR per person as deposit which you could spend for food and beverages. Food quality wasn't great. Not sure if I come again. Maybe only for photoshoot.,"We went here without an appointment,  but we got the table & we need to pay IDR 100.000 in advance per person, and that can be exchanged with food later inside the restaurant.
It's better to make a reservation first before coming here.
This place is really an Instagramable photos and videos area. The place is divided into 2 places roof top and picnic area below, the top floor will be hot if the sun up with clear sky. Lucky, we were a bit cloudy and windy, so it was not hot at all.
The foods are is all good and delicious. I don't find any problem with the food.
Truffles soup good portion, taste good too.
Baileys tiramisu, lovely tiramisu, the baileys not too strong and coffee flavor just rite.
Creamy Carbonars, not too creamy and good too.
Fried rice with pork, my favorite and recommended menu.
Nasi lemak is also ok. The coconut rice also smells really good
Saigon Pork Ribs, good one and pork tender and juicy.
Small issues few fruit flies flew around while we ate, but the waiters told us already the consequences for eating at the top floor, and we were ok.

Overall, it is a good place to eat, photos, and enjoying Lake beratan view with mountains.","Eating in a Glass House.
We had Lunch there.
Little strange is the deposit for a 50k pp minimum spending right at the parking lot.
Think this place is kinda famous for the building as it can't be about the food.
The service was good and friendly.
We had Pad Thai which been honestly as far away from the original as from here to the moon.
I am a big fan of noodle dishes especially Pad Thai but this was something else.

The grilled Ham and Cheese Sandwich was with too much oil
surely no butter was used. It tasted also as used oil was used.
Laksa was good. Chicken cubes been cut to big for our taste.
Cappuccino was a little weak.
For us no place to go back."

My visit to this highly-rated strawberry farm was unfortunately underwhelming and did not live up to the hype. Here's why:

Unwelcoming First Impression: Upon arrival, the staff was not welcoming, and there was a lack of clear guidance or information provided. This made the start of the visit quite confusing and unwelcoming.

Scant Strawberry Selection: The primary disappointment was the scarcity of strawberries. After 20 minutes of searching, we managed to find only six strawberries, which, to our dismay, were somewhat bitter. Those looking for sweet and plump strawberries might find this place unsatisfactory.

Poor Overall Farm Experience: The overall experience at the farm was far from enjoyable. There was a noticeable absence of service and the staff seemed unfriendly, especially towards tourists. It felt as if locals might receive better treatment, but as a visitor, I didn't feel valued or respected.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend this farm to those who are enthusiastic about strawberry picking or seeking a pleasant day out. Perhaps our visit was an off day for the farm, but based on this experience, it's hard to justify the high ratings it has received.","good for families and young kids. can pick your own and bring home. they also sell pre picked strawberries. good size and color and taste, actual quality. can do the whole in 30 minutes if u choose. plenty of parking. recommended if in the area; combine with camping and kebun raya for a nice bedugul weekend.",Really a best experience we feel.  We harvest the strawberries in the fields and ate it without any cost. If you want to purchase it they charged 100000 idr for 1 kg.,"A large strawberry farm where we can do self-picking. The price per kilo is pretty cheaper than it is in local market in Denpasar or Badung.

We can pick strawberries as many as we want then the farm care taker will weight them and calculate the total price.

The strawberry here is the sweetest I‚Äôve ever had. The size ranged from small to big one. It is best to come with shorts and sandals as we need to squat to get the strawberry and some raws have a wet soil.","Great experience of picking strawberries.
Must try"

It is a shame about the animals in small cages though üò¢","The restaurant was very attractive considering the good reviews on Google. We arrived and waited during 10 mn before a waitress take care about us. We ordered some strawberry juices, strawberry rice and the famous strawberry pancakes. We waited around 30 mn to have only our juices, one hour for the rice and more than 1h15 for the strawberry pancakes! It was so long. The restaurant was not full at all and nobody from the staff was sorry that we waited so long! The food is good but not amazing.
After 1 hour waiting, I decided to go around and visit the garden. As an animal lover, I was in shock there. If the garden is really beautiful, these people doesn‚Äôt respect animals. They are in small cages and some of them are in a bad conditions. Rabbits, there, break my heart: they couldn‚Äôt move in their individual cage, full of holes, some of them seem to become crazy and others ones are injured or have atrophied members. Please, if you love animals, don‚Äôt go there, there is plenty of nice places to eat in the area. I hope the owners will do something for these poor rabbits that I am sure they suffer a lot üñ§."

The PRONS: Really low prices, helpful and polite owner, good service, clean dishes, satisfying portions, handmade french fries.

The CONS: Situated in a neighborhood high up a steep heel, there was no music, it was so silent that we had to put on music from our mobile, no WiFi, no soft drinks, we were the only clients during our stay, the toilets were not very clean and placed on the ground floor inside a warehouse.

Really sorry but I wouldn't recommend it. A message to the owner: You were really polite, but please fix some basic things to improve your restaurant!

Despite a booking issue they were able to host me (although in a provided tent). For a tent, it was very comfortable and they even placed a power supply inside the tent. The cable of the outside lamp won‚Äôt pass any T√úV inspection but it worked. What I really liked was the food. Both the dinner (I had Bakso Ayam) and the included breakfast (I had Nasi Goreng and hot tea) were tasty and a good opportunity to taste some typical Bali/Indonesian food cooked with love by the owners. Just be reminded that the food is by default spicy from a European perspective.
I only used the shared washrooms as I wasn‚Äôt sleeping in one of the bungalows. Therefore the washroom review reflect the shared ones. I don‚Äôt know about the ones of the rooms.
The best word to describe them: basic.
The showers consisted of a big water bucket with a smaller one to pure over the body. It serves the purpose but not more. A negative point is the missing light in these rooms.
For the toilets, they are basic as well. They only consist of the ‚Äúsquatting‚Äù version rather than the normally known sitting toilet. And yes, they are (again from European perspective) in a slightly state of disrepair (some cracks in the ground or in the walls). BUT: they were clean. However, toilet paper is not provided as it clogs the toilet.
If it wasn‚Äôt for the food and the flexibility with it I would give less stars.
And if I can speak a wish, it would be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù showers. Even basic ones with just cold water would serve my desire.
The location is on the shores of the lake and a few walking minutes (along a busy road without a consistent sidewalk) away from the famous Ulan temple. It‚Äôs not the most instagramable spot but still nice.
In the end, the price reflects the received value. It‚Äôs very cheap but with the hook of only basic common washrooms.",This place starts blasting amplified karaoke music at 6am.,Nice place with amazing views of bedugul lake,
