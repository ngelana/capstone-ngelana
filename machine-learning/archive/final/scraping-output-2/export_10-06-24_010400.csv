The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, making it a perfect start to the day. The staff were friendly and provided excellent service. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back!","Amazing pricing, crazy big portion and great food. The brunch food here are scrumptious and I don‚Äôt think I can ever find another place with such big portion, but at a lower price than the usual pricing.

Only downside here is that there‚Äôs no parking for cars, and no AC so it‚Äôs pretty hot. They close pretty early too, at about 2pm they start to put up the chairs.","It was such an amazing experience here! The food was incredible, and the service was quick and very friendly! I had the Surf's UP Juice and the Eggz Benz and they were spectacular! Highly recommend visiting here and I'll definitely be back to try more of the delicious food!!","Great place to have brunch! Been coming here since 2017. Big portions, great smoothies and coffee. My favourite savoury dishes - Carlito, Eggs Benz, Frenchie and all salads!","A very popular breakfast and brunch place with a vast selection of options including various musli bowls, eggs, toasts with toppings etc. Delicious shakes, nice coffee. The food tastes good, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it amazing. Overall the place is a bit overhyped.

The portions are very big, some even too huge.

The place is quite spacious, but can get somewhat crowded - the service is quick though: you order and pay at the counter and the food is brought to the table within minutes. Don‚Äôt know how well they cope with the crowd in the peak season though.

Minimalistic design, sort of an industrial atmosphere with vacation vibes."

The sourdough was very high quality, the smashed avocado was super fresh and tasty, the bacon was made just at the right level, and the scrambled egg was super fluffy and fresh.
The smoothie bowl was very tasty.

We also ordered the green juice which was super refreshing.

Prices are quite high for the value, but still would recommend this meal as a must in Canggu!","This place is highly overrated. The food is good, but you can find similar or even better places in the area that are cheaper.

95% of the time I've been here, there's been a line, and you have to wait at least 10 minutes to be seated. You feel the anticipation from people arriving, hoping you finish eating quickly, as the line forms in front of you and everyone is staring.

I recommend it, but not as a regular spot, as it seems more like a tourist attraction due to its high number of reviews. Additionally, it's an open venue, and the kitchen generates a lot of heat, which can be unbearable, especially on warm days, making it even less conducive to linger.","Had lunch here and picked the 5-option menu with a house-made lemon iced tea. The pumpkin bun tasted nice and the smoked salmon with the salad were a nice mix to put on there. The cinnamon roll was too sweet in my opinion and the sunny side up eggs were a little weird in texture. The lemon iced tea tasted more like water with lemon than an iced tea.

I enjoyed the concept of picking what you want, the food looks good when served and the actual service RUNS to keep all customers happy. They deserve a shoutout for the amazing service.

Upon arrival I had to wait about 10/15min to be seated and they really try to get the customers in and out as quickly as they can. Which in my opinion is a good thing since they are extremely busy.

I am happy I tried it.","Famous breakfast spot in Canggu! Given the option to build your own breakfast. Too small portion for the protein. 3 tiny slices smoked salmon, no way!!! (but really they could‚Äôve added like 3 slices more I guess haha). Ambience was great, small place, but always crowded especially in breakfast hour. Bf and I came around 9 on Sunday and lots of folks was in waiting list to get seated. The earlier the better üëç",Ok.  I was surprised at just how good this place was.  If you like small plates/bites then this is the place.  3 options for 75 or 5 for 115.  So you can have sweet and savoury with breakfast.  Go early before 09:00 as this place has queues

Very social vibe thanks to reps in particular Mouse and Patrick who were amazing at getting everyone involved and created such a nice atmosphere ! Will definitely be back!!!!!","Stayed for two nights before flying off to my next destination. The staff at  reception were very kind and courteous towards me and even helped me receive a medical package. The female dorm was quite spacious and nicely cooled via AC. The beds are big and the space to put things by your head is a nice touch. My mattress was extremely bad though and you could feel every little bit of metal wiring since there was no padding left. The beds also make quite some noise when you move in it.

The bathrooms are ensuite but outside, I had no issues with that.

Breakfast is more a snack than an actual breakfast and that is how you should consider it to be. Something to help you start your day and nothing more.

Since my flight left quite late there was no issue leaving my bags behind, using the common area and even showering before I left for the airport. The location is decent and I found it nice that it is not on the main street. Parties end at 10:30pm which is beautiful for the people that want to sleep at a reasonable hour.

I did hear a lot about how the owner treats his staff/guests from guests, which is questionable. Yet, I have no experience in this matter.
I overall enjoyed my stay here.","Really nice hostel, I really enjoyed my stay here. There are different activities everyday and if you like to party this is the place for you. The volenteers are also really fun and nice, but a special shout-out for Emotion, she made my stay even better :)","Gabriella - A Memorable Stay

From the moment we stepped into this hostel, Gabgabs exceptional hospitality left an indelible mark on our entire experience. Her commitment to creating a warm and inviting atmosphere goes above and beyond expectations, transforming a simple stay into something truly extraordinary.

Gabriella's kindness is unmatched, evident in every interaction. Whether offering local insights, assisting with travel plans, or simply engaging in friendly conversation, her genuine care for guests is palpable. It's not just about providing a bed; it's about crafting an environment where visitors feel valued and welcomed.

What sets Gabriella apart is not only her professionalism but also her fun-loving nature. Hanging out with her felt like being with an old friend, creating an atmosphere that made our stay not just comfortable but genuinely enjoyable. She effortlessly balances professionalism with a personal touch, making guests feel more like family than temporary residents.

Gabriella's dedication to ensuring guests have a memorable experience is truly commendable. Her attention to detail and commitment to going the extra mile make this hostel stand out among the rest. Whether it's recommending hidden gems in the city or arranging activities for guests to enjoy together, she understands the essence of creating a community within the hostel walls."

The staff was very helpful and prompt.

Cons
No diet side
No cold coconut avail","This is my personal opinion that the taste and flavour of the food is tweaked towards to accommodate foreigners taste bud. The food is indeed local food but taste bland without the usual Indonesia twist and spice. Maybe it‚Äôs because I come from Malaysia and used to the usual Indonesian powerful flavour.

Service is great! Very courteous staff. Ambience is beautiful! There‚Äôs a long line to dine in. I‚Äôm sure others might think differently.","Visited there after seeing the reviews on Google and bang on it justified the place.
What a breezy infrastructure that gives old school vibes and calms you down on a sunny day. We have ordered  a self assorted nasi campur plate and nasi goreng, they have a mainly 4 section consisting of rice/noodle, main course, sides and salads and all of them contain a variety of dishes you can choose from. Staff is friendly and they also provide free crackers .
Cons: In the assorted plates items displayed aren't hot, they were constantly replacing but still there is a gap there.
As it's on busy street of canggu, it's hard to find parking there so you have to find parking there.
Overall it was a nice experience will recommend you to try.","Decent options but the food weren‚Äôt warm. Everything was cold as it‚Äôs just been sitting there, which is like most warungs I guess.

Flavors weren‚Äôt what we expected and were disappointed given the great reviews it has. I wouldn‚Äôt specially make a trip out to give it a go. More of trying it if you‚Äôre passing by.

Busy throughout the day, we had late lunch, roughly 3pm and tables were full. Appreciated the clean tables tho :)",Pretty good food - just that Nasi Goreng was not a lot. Everything else was a lot! Still happy with my food and their garlic chips ‚ò∫Ô∏è

This is an open-air studio with natural wood floors and a tarped gazebo ceiling. I believe it was clean for what it is as were the props. This isn‚Äôt a luxury experience and that‚Äôs okay. I would attend yoga here again.","I really liked the yoga class

And also because this place has a hot room for practicing hot yoga.
My favorite class is Hot therapy with Tamuna - it‚Äôs really deep work with mussels, after 3 months of doing this my asanas improved a lot!
Highly appreciate the professional skills of the teacher, her help to go deeper, individual approach to the students, and final shavasana rutuals ‚ú® it‚Äôs fantastic","Just finished a yoga class here‚Ä¶ the class was not great, the teacher was quite inexperienced and her cuing was awful to non-existent meaning we constantly had to watch her.  But the worst part of all was having staff come in to film us during class- without any prior mention or request if it was okay.   This is meant to be yoga, a space where we have to opportunity to connect/yoke to our mind/body/spirit.   We were completely robbed of that opportunity by the obtrusive and unwelcome filming.

Service must be warm. Zai Caf√© scores a few, misses the taste mark slightly. Our food line-up included scallop on a shell with mango and green oil. This platter was so beautiful, we almost didn‚Äôt want to mess it up. Green oil was ingenious, but the mango sauce seems unnecessary. Moussaka is a must, by our books. There‚Äôs something in the yoghurt that transforms the otherwise humble dish. Tagliatelli with tuna tartare, creamy pesto with fresh truffle would have been superb if the pasta didn‚Äôt clump together (a little oil should do the trick). Nonetheless, the taste profile was good. Another brow raiser and never seen before dish was halloumi, beautifully plated on a round bed of watermelon with berry jam. We just didn‚Äôt get how each element would become bedfellows. Soon, we grew the halloumi and watermelon combination. We had superb, standout, warm and sweet service from Leoni, who even arranged a birthday blowout with a sweet treat of napoleon cake.

The restaurant's rustic wooden interior and panoramic views of the surrounding greenery provide the perfect backdrop for a leisurely meal. Food and beverages are always fresh and tasty, such a cool atmosphere for working from cafe or just chilling while having your breakfast and coffee, coffee was good as always.

The ambiance is truly enchanting, with the expansive rice fields stretching as far as the eye can see.

It is fancy among Western dropouts, internet entrepreneurs, and influencers. Since the place has a good wifi you see many people with laptop computers hanging around and sipping their coffees. The coffee is really good and we enjoyed locally inspired breakfast and a delicious fruit bowl. Compared to other places the price is still okay but a little bit more on the high side.
The restaurant/bar is at the end of a dead-end street and most people take their own scooter to go there. However, you can also take a Grab (similar to Uber) to get you there. Currently, there is a lot of building activity around and the idyllic location amidst the rice fields has therefore suffered somewhat."

The ambiance is charming, and the staff is friendly and attentive. Also the six rabbits hopping around makes it complete.

The food was good and it was enough. I've also read (fake?) negative reviews about portion sizes and taste, but I completely disagree. The food was flavorful, and the portions were generous, as you can see in my photos. Perhaps we had a great chef today. Just give it a try yourself. Definitely worth it.

One small point of attention... the rabbit decorations might attract families with children. However, if the little ones need to use the restroom, they might end up with nightmares for the rest of their lives due to the two dolls in thereüòÇ.","By far the best Balinese restaurant that I ever had!
Everything was fresh and delicious.
The staff were very friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was incredible.
I would definitely suggest anyone to try this place!","Food was amazing. Thanks to Evon.

The cafe presents a setting that instantly wins you over with its inviting setup and comfortable seating arrangement, perfect for a relaxed meal.

The staff at 12 Urban Cafe deserves a special mention for their helpfulness, ensuring that our dining experience was smooth and memorable. Their attentive service added an extra layer of enjoyment to our evening.

As for the food ‚Äì it was nothing short of spectacular. The oysters were possibly the best I've ever savored, fresh and bursting with flavor, setting a high bar for seafood lovers. The tuna poke bowl was a harmony of taste and freshness, while the watermelon salad brought a refreshing and sweet balance to our meal.

In short, don't miss the chance to dine at 12 Urban Cafe when you're in Canggu.

Burrito was grilled to satisfying crunch. Big portion but I found the beef marinade to be way too sweet. House Chili sauce was good but was also on the sweeter side. If the beef marinade was less sweet, the burrito would be amazing.

Good value for quantity of food but would probably order something else next time. Iced latte was refreshing and they have 20k coffee happy hour from 1-3pm daily. Music added to ambience and was not overly loud or distracting.

Staff are very attentive and nice even during rush hour.","The staff is nice! They understand what a happy face can do to customers! The food was great, although my choice for in the morning was pretty heavy: breakfast burrito with a lot of meat, which was super yummy. I do recommend them, especially when everyone goes to Copenhagen, while this gem is right next to it!","One of the best walkable breakfast cafes in Canggu. The parking space is quite small (the best option is to use motorcycles), but the food is worth it. I tried the Brekkie Burritos (5 out of 5) and it's one of the best Burritos I've ever tasted. I also tried the BLT Bagels with extra sunny side eggs (4 out of 5). The Smoothies and Smoothies Bowl were also good and refreshing (4.5 out of 5). The service is so kind and warm, overall it's a delightful experience","I can see why it's famous. The cappuccino and brunch were great. It's so popular that I think I have to endure the congestion. If you're looking for a quiet place, no. I'll come back to eat something delicious.","Cali brisket burrito was superb!!! ü§© i love slow cooked meat and it was so flavorful, not to mention the portion was big so it was really worth it.

The chicken is soo soft and yummy, ajitake also taste yummy.
Soup taste so yummy and creamy, I like it but somehow its slightly smells like a raw chicken(?) Just slightly tho.

My boyfriend had Chasu Ramen, the pork was so soft and good too.
Karaage also taste yummy, We love it üòÜ.
We also ordered Rice, I like it too.

Free flow tea. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Also they give free cotton candy and you can make it yourself! such a memorable experience!! üòÜ

The staff is so Kind, friendly and always smiling.
Food coming so fast like only in 10-15mins I guess  (there are 5 other customers).

The room is little bit warm because they are semi outdoor restaurant so they dont use ac but there are some wall fans, so its okay.

Restroom is so clean.

Price is a bit expensive for locals but its definitely worth it!
You will understand what I mean once you try it yourself üòä","Got what you would typically call Tonkotsu Ramen  but it was titled ‚ÄúChasu Ramen‚Äù. For some reason it came with ?chicken? Chasu (whatever that means) and regular pork Chasu. Asked for no chicken Chasu because it just threw me off. No price change for less food. Fair enough.

As a bowl of ramen 0/5. As a bowl of hot soup noodles if your craving a warm pick me up 2.5/5.  Would not call this Ramen per say, but ‚Äúdoes the job‚Äù and is edible as a bowl of hot soup noodles if you need it as a hit of comfort food.

Had my fare share of genuine Ramen with culturally authentic ingredients. And this is not it. Tbh far from it.

*However, the flavour did approach something similar to what my Chinese mom would make on a lazy Saturday afternoon with a chicken broth base (which this definitely was).

Very oily and greasy maybe to emulate genuine ramen broth? (See pic) tableside seasoning smells like oregano and also curry spice? Really threw me for a loop since I was at a Ramen restaurant.

Not genuine ramen noodles, super thick, chewy and somewhat undercooked. More likely resembled something like udon.

TLDR: Not Ramen, is hot soup that is mediocre at best.","Well, as someone who has lived in Japan for 10 years, I would say, this tastes somehow different from the Ramen in Japan, but still it was quite good.
The price is quite high, compared with other noodle shops in Bali.
They are also charging 10% tax and 5% service fee for extra.","I came here for dinner and ordered the creamy chicken ramen and some chicken gyozas. The flavour of the broth was really nice yet a tiny bit too salty. The chicken melted in your mouth and the noodles were of good thickness. The gyozas were nice and came with a garlic/ginger soy sauce. Upon arrival we got a glass of cold green tea and service was quick to serve our food. Decently priced considering this is Canggu. I liked it.
(Bare in mind, this doesn't taste close to original Japanese ramen, but it's quite tasty!)","Ok, I‚Äôve waited 1,5 years to write this review. Because every time I come to stay here, I visit this place few times, and I expected it to get worse with time. It never happened. It got better.

Now I‚Äôm clear: people who run this place are extraordinarily passionate to make tastiest, most beautiful ramen for their customers.
By the way a true gem is vegan ramen. Im pretty sure it got better than it was 1 year ago.

Please carry on with what you do. It‚Äôs one in a hundred type of place in Canggu."

First impression was great. We stayed at Desaku for 3 days with kids even though this place is not kids friendly but it‚Äôs fine . Easily ordered yummy foods around Desaku and u get a really nice dining area to eat. Staff were friendly and very strict.

The only downside is the cleanliness. I think it‚Äôs time to upgrade the room linen, and provide the guests with duvet as blanket instead of some old blankie. There were too many mosquitos at night as there are holes on the wooden door. At one night I killed 7 mosquitos so I could have a good sleep.","I highly recommend Desaku Bungalows for both long term and short term stay!
I was living here for 8 months and Desaku was truly my home away from home, and I miss it so so much. The location is perfect; just a short bike ride to the beach and all the best cafes, stores and restaurants Canggu has to offer. It's also very close to Pererenan.
The area itself is very clean, green and peaceful - away from Canggu traffic yet in the city centre. I stayed in the private villas and it was always peaceful, quiet and calm with so much sunlight in the bathroom. The room itself is equipped with everything you need - little kitchenette, AC, TV, desk etc.

If I had any problem, I just had to mention it to reception and maintenance and it would be fixed instantly!The team is the best. Thank you to everyone at the team of Desaku and especially thank you Rahayu for everything. I miss it so much and I know I will be back soon.","Beautiful location at the end of a side street to one of Canggu's bustling main arteries.

Pretty calm and peaceful there. An oasis.

There's a kitchen where you can cook if you want.

And a co-working area on top of a building where you can enjoy a view and a cool breeze all day.

Close to number of food locations. Nice surrounding area. Close to surf.","Enjoyed a lovely stay at this hotel, it felt like such a tranquil spot away from any noisy bars and restaurants.

Great facilities including air con, day beds around the pool and nice seating, good wifi and a pool table.
