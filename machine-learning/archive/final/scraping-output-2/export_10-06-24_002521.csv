The owner is really friendly and greeted us warmly. I heard from a reliable source that the husband and wife owners are from India. I loved the ambience of this place. Lots of greenery and natural beauty all around. As for the food, it was wonderful albeit it took quite a while to arrive. Loved the chicken curry and tea.","+What's more..
I was the only person who struggled with booking system for 3 hours at reception lobby but only I was the one who tried to solve problem. Passive manager and staffs didn't do anything but just wait.. Is that all my issue book at just regular worldwide booking agent website? THEN YOUR COMPANY SHOULD ONLY ACCEPT ONLY BY YOUR OFFICIAL WEBSITE, NOT THAT AGENT SITE. THEN WHOELSE WILL BOOK YOUR HOTEL ONLY BY YOUR WEBSITE?

I ruined all my day and manager just suggested me extra  laundry service (which was USELESS FOR) at the time of 7pm. But she didn't mention that laundry service of that day is already over that day and I have to pickup at next day 5pm (which is after my checkout time). She didn't realize that that was SO USELESS for me at all. After just mentioning that useless word, she didn't show up at all. It was the problem of YOUR HOTEL AND BOOKING AGENT THAT YOU'VE CONTRACT WITH, NOT MY OWN PROBLEM AT ALL.

TERRIBLE BOOKING MANAGER AND RECEPTION'S SERVICE AND HOTEL BOOKING SYSTEM.  So disappointed with staff named with Ojek and her arrogant attitude. They didn't give compensate for their bad service and system and even staff is arrogant. They ruined all my images of Bali. Even hotel don't have any systemic service about taxi, breakfast, dining and etc.
I wasted all money to this hotel. I definitely will NOT recommend here to all public.
If you want to go out to ubud, you have to pay directly 4 times more to hotel directly. Are they taxi company too?","My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights and we really enjoyed our stay here. The staff were really kind and helpful and the room and facilities were exceptionally clean.

We booked the Suite Double Bed room and it was extremely spacious! To get to your room, the staff take you on a ride on their golf cart/buggy which is a nice fun little experience. You can also walk to your room too since there’s a more direct and shorter path that you can take on foot. There’s free bottle water in the room and we were able to request more if needed. There are 3 infinity pools on different levels and they’re open until pretty late. It was really enjoyable to be in the pool looking into the jungle. The spa was a bit pricey but I did decide to splurge and get a hair treatment and it was really professional and lovely.

The only thing to be aware of is that the area is heavily monitored by the local taxi mafia, which allows for Grab/Gojek to drop off passengers but not pick them up, forcing you to use the taxi mafia or hire a private driver to leave the resort. To get to Ubud Center (where the Art Market is) from the resort, we were quoted 150K idr (~15min drive) which we thought was pricey. The resort does offer daily free shuttles to Ubud Center at 10am and 3pm but you must inform the front desk the day prior if you’d like to use the shuttle, and the shuttle was actually operated by the taxi mafia!

We ended up hiring a driver from the local taxi mafia for a day just because it was more convenient and we hired him again to drive us to Padang Bai harbour when we left, since he was very kind and we enjoyed our experience with him.","My family and I recently had a three-night stay at Hotel Kenran in Ubud, Bali. The hotel's beautiful architecture and tranquil ambiance left a positive impression on us. The kindness, helpfulness, and dedication exhibited by the staff were commendable and they deserve a special mention.

We chose the half-board option during our stay, which unfortunately did not live up to expectations. The limited meal options - grilled chicken breast or fish curry - lacked variety and didn't meet our expectations for a hotel of this stature.

When we decided to switch to à la carte meals and requested our half-board to be cancelled or credited, we were disappointed that the hotel was unable to accommodate this. This meant we had to bear the additional cost of à la carte meals, despite already having paid for the half-board.

Additionally, the two-day duration for decision-making and communication seemed unnecessarily long for this kind of issue. We felt this was not in line with the standards we expected from the hotel.

In conclusion, while the hotel and its incredible staff provided a worthwhile experience, the inflexibility regarding the half-board arrangement was a letdown. We hope our feedback will be taken into consideration for future guests' experiences. Despite these concerns, we would like to express our appreciation to the hotel for its overall good service","My recent stay at The Kenran Resort Ubud By Soscomma was unfortunately far from satisfactory. Despite the promising name, the reality fell short of expectations.

Firstly, the accommodation did not match the advertised standards. The room was not properly cleaned upon arrival, and there were noticeable issues with maintenance, such as malfunctioning fixtures and dated furnishings. The overall atmosphere lacked the luxurious ambiance one would expect from a resort of this caliber.

The biggest disappointment, however, was the dining experience. Despite the resort's claims of offering fine dining, the quality of the food was subpar. The menu lacked variety, and the dishes served were uninspired and lacking in flavor. Additionally, the service at the restaurant was slow and indifferent, further detracting from the overall dining experience.

Overall, my stay at The Kenran Resort Ubud By Soscomma was a disappointment. For the price paid, the quality of accommodation, dining, and service were simply not up to par. I would advise potential guests to consider other options when planning their stay in Ubud."

First off, the whole staff was outstanding! They all provided a truly 5* service. The room had a very good size and the best of it was the bathroom with both a shower and a bathtub. We also had the opportunity to enjoy the infinity pool with views to the gorgeous jungle. There were plenty options for breakfast and everything was super tasty. We also had the chance to dine during one of the theme nights with traditional balinese dancers. That was well worth it! If you love nature and luxury simultaneously, this is the place to stay.  By the way, both the mattress and pillows granted me the best sleep throughout this trip in Indonesia!
Only minor items which might not even be an issue for some people: - It takes about 15min to get warm water in the shower/tub - The resort is not that close to Ubud center, so you always have to get transport to get to a restaurant/bar","This is an amazing resort! Super peaceful and relaxing. The staff and services were beyond excellent and the room stayed super clean thanks to the house cleaning manager and his staff. They would prepare our room for the day and the night while paying attention to small details in the room.The restaurant staff and front desk staff were super friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. My fiancé and I could not recommend this resort enough and we will definitely be stay at this resort when we visit Bali again!","Such a wonderful location. Beautiful forest and waterfall view from the suites. The view from the pool is breathtaking. Absolutely delicious breakfast with plenty of choice. Staff very friendly and kind.
Suits are a bit old but that’s the charm. Love how you will find the logo of Kayon in many different things like towels and lamps.
One of the best massages in Bali we received at Kayon!","Beautiful resort off the main roads and set along a valley with a water fall.

Good place to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Ubud.

Rooms are not bad but a bit dated. Probably that’s the decor.

Probably might return if the price drops.","A Magical Romantic Dinner at The Kayon Resort Ubud

My partner and I recently had the pleasure of celebrating our wedding anniversary with a special romantic dinner at The Kayon Resort Ubud, and it was an unforgettable experience. The private dinner, set by a natural waterfall with a mesmerizing view, was nothing short of magical.

The setting was beautifully decorated with candles, creating a warm and intimate ambiance. As we entered the area, we were stunned by the incredible beauty and serenity of the surroundings. It truly felt like a scene from a fairy tale.

We were treated to a sumptuous 7-course meal that exceeded all expectations. Each dish was exquisitely prepared and presented, and the flavors were simply outstanding. The meal included a selection of fine wine, perfect for toasting our special occasion.

The service was impeccable, with a special mention to Gomboh, who made our evening exceptionally memorable. He was incredibly polite and attentive, ensuring that every moment of our celebration was perfect. Gomboh also went above and beyond by helping us capture countless photos, adding to the cherished memories of our anniversary.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our romantic dinner and would highly recommend this experience to any couple looking for a special place to celebrate. The Kayon Resort Ubud offers an enchanting and intimate setting that is ideal for creating lasting memories.

The staff is incredible - speaks great English so communication is easy.

Extremely hygienic in terms of food preparation and water (all filtered/bottled). We did the cooking class as well and we got a sense of how careful they are. Ate at the restaurant 4-5 times (drinks, salads, raw veggies and never got Bali belly).  They also are good about providing unlimited complimentary glass bottles of filtered water as you ask for it.

The rooms are also gorgeous - plunge pool overlooking the jungle was beautiful.

All Bali hotels have some insects but this one was minimal. We also saw them do mosquito smoke treatments which helped a lot - plus they refill mosquito oils in your room every evening.

Definitely recommend the Balinese cooking class it was one of the best things we did in Bali.  You end up cooking 2 meals worth of food :) which they serve you for lunch and dinner later if you want.

A++ just stay here if you can swing the price - the value is absolutely there.","Had very pleasant stay for 3 nights. Nice food and excellent spa service in this resort. Free Yoga class was good as well.
Though there were some hiccups during our first night we stayed here, the staff /manager immediately took some actions.","Tejaprana is such a beautiful Resort. I’ve never seen such a caring and dedicated staff team. The room are ACed with a lovely view. They offer a large variety of spa treatments, good food on premises, even with evening animations. We went there with our toddler. They were great and helping.","Extremely beautiful resort and hotel ! The villas are magnificent ! We spent 5 wonderful days for our honeymoon. The staff is young and very reactive. There is also attention to detail which we highly appreciated (ex.  water bottles are left next to the bathroom sink which is extremely convenient as you need mineral water to brush your teeth in Bali). I see people complaining about bugs - being sensitive to this, it was not a problem. You are in the jungle so it’s totally normal. Location wise - yes, you need transport to Ubud, but again, generally speaking Bali is not adapted for pedestrians. The only thing which we would advise on is a more clear communication on activities. There are inconsistencies between the website, the leaflets and the information the staff in the reception may give you. This was regrettable and made us unable to subscribe to an activity we really wanted to try due to a lack of clear information. However, still I would recommend 100% !","We stayed in the one bed with private pool with view onto the jungle and that was absolutely amazing. The team there are so helpful and the hospitality and service is excellent. You need to take a cab to central Ubud. Beautiful yoga shala, classes 2 x per week."

Very friendly and helpful staff. Great food. Awesome views from the villa of the jungle and the sounds of the waterfall. Only 20 mins shuttle bus in to Ubud center. Absolutely loved our stsy there.,"My wife and I came here for our honey moon. We stayed 4 nights, it was amazing. We got the room with river views, but honestly all the rooms looked like they had amazing views. The restaurant on site is wonderful, serving up some of the best resort breakfast I've ever had. The staff were top tier, super friendly, always asking how we were going and just generally being super helpful. The spa was really great too!!

The one sort of drawback is you can't exactly walk from the resort to anything super close by. You need a taxi, and whilst the resort has its own private drivers, they were all really good too, clean cars, great english etc. I suppose that's what you get for being in the rainforest.

Highly highly recommend this place if you're ever in Bali, Ubud. Some top tier relaxation and pampering.","We stayed at this resort for 4 nights in a private pool room. Overall we were extremely satisfied. The resort is small, and therefore I found the service to be more personal / intimate than larger resorts which was nice. Couldn't fault any of the staff, they were super helpful. My only criticism is a small one - there is fig trees over the top of the villas and really hard figs fall down hit the roof etc, which is fine, and over the pool there is a netting to catch some, however they go right through the holes. I ended up sitting under an umbrella whilst at the pool to avoid being hit in the head. No big deal as it's a jungle resort. Perhaps the netting above the pools could be a tighter weave? Anyway apart from that everything else was flawless and we will return.","There is so much that I would like to say about this place and how much I loved it.

I think it’s easy to understand from the pictures already posted online that this place is heaven on earth. You feel surrounded by the calm, the sound of the jungle, the peace and serenity, as soon as you reach the resort. It is also, very romantic. This is a 5 stars resort and it deserves all the recognition possible for the work they achieve.

On a practical side, we stayed in April for 4 days and the rooms (with private pool) are spacious, cleaned everyday with water refill and all, and make you feel like home very easily. We did use the laundry service it was impeccable.

On the public amenities side, the hotel is in my view, perfect, the restaurant is excellent and the pool is so relaxing with a superb view on the jungle. Heaven on earth.

Activities proposed through the resort are really good (i.e the cooking class with the amazing chef of the resort, the rice field tour with a lovely guide, the photography session …). Also, the transport facilitation they offer was incredible.

Now, the biggest highlight is the team. The most remarkable is how kind and understanding they are - delivering the best service possible. This remark include also the staff of the restaurant.

They are very accommodating, sometimes  even a step ahead of you for arranging things (Epita is an incredible woman).

Their constant smiles and goodness are the best part of it. They care and look after you.
Good people, with two lovely cats who sometimes bring jungle presents to customers.

I was really sad to leave. But thank you so much for our stay. Best one of our Balinese trip.","I loved my stay at The Sebali resort. Everything was wonderful, from room to staff to the food ! It was all amazing.
The resort is located in the middle of the jungle and just above a river. Which makes it the perfect escape from the busy life and city vibes.
The floating breakfast was just charming!!!!

Although I got a nice package from the resort's website, I don't highly recommend the river view as you can only see small part of the river.
The free shuttle was a great way to go to the downtown, It's better to inform the reception that you need the shuttle prior to your time of going out.
The staff are very helpful and polite. My husband got sick during our stay and I had to call the staff at the middle of the night to order ginger tea with honey and lemon. Although it wasn't in their menu, but the provided it immediately."

It will be on my must-visit list for my next vacation in Bali. They offer a very authentic taste of Indian food, and there are several menu items that I rarely find at other restaurants. On my first day, I tried the gulab jamun, and it made a perfect first impression on me.

The waiter will ask you to choose your spice level: Indian spicy or Indonesian spicy. I made the mistake of thinking Indonesian spicy would be milder than Indian spicy, but it turned out to be spicier.

As an additional story, I met the owner in the bike parking lot while looking for the way to the restaurant. He directed me to the restaurant and introduced me to Miss Nopi, who guided me during my visit. She was very helpful and offered to show me the good spots in the area, but due to cloudy weather, I had to head home soon. Miss Nopi and all the staff on duty today were so helpful and warmly welcomed me for my lunch time. The owner also offered me a discount because it's rare for Indonesians to come here to try Indian cuisine. Thank you so much!

Next time I visit, I'll definitely stay longer. The weather and the vibes were simply perfect. 😘👌🏼","A high quality place to eat outstanding Indian delicacies. 🙏🏼 I couldn't stop eating. There was so much to try.
And the view into the jungle is stunning. I just wanted to stay there forever.
Very kind staff and awesome service. I'll come back for sure!
Can recommend everyone who likes to eat in a super class place. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","I experienced the best quality of Indian food, service, and kindness at Natti's Indian restaurant❤️‍🔥 I ordered Mutton Rogan Josh (spicy goat meat) and Goan prawn curry with butter nan and Bastian rice, all of them are exceptionally scrumptious! The staff are super kind and professional, especially my server ""Donny"". He answered in detail all my questions about the menu and never lost his smile all the way. The atmosphere of this restaurant is also amazing. I will definitely visit here again when available 😊","Wauw 😍 I tried many Indian places in my life but this restaurant is one of the best till so far! Every dish had THE perfect flavor and amount of spiciness 👌 Also the portions were exactly right.

The restaurant is located in the back of a resort and has a view on nature and calm vibes. Very tasteful design and traditional interior.

The people that work here are super warm, professional and their service is excellent. At daytime they serve the most food options> I took the non vegetarian Thali, which was amazing!

By coincidence I met one of the owners (Indian)  of the restaurant: very friendly men aswell. I will definitely come back. Thank you 🙏🏼","I surprised my wife with a honeymoon romantic dinner!
After contacting Shiva to make it all happen, I could not be me impressed and happy with how everything turned out. Absolutely amazing!
It is a memory that will last with us forever.

We arrived around 9:30 to the airport and we had Bomo waiting for us. He was very nice nice with us and during the Transfer he was telling us a bit about their culture. We have really enjoyed the ride with him.
When we arrived to the hotel they received us very well, we register for next day breakfast and everything was great.
The room had increíble views to the jungle, the swimming pool was one of the BEST things from the Villa. There was a bit of humidity but this is part of the enviroment. The room could be more clean but It was not a big deal. You could not hear any noise at night time just the nature and the animals that life around and algo the little waterfall.
Novi was very nice with us explaining us how everything work and all the services they provide. We enjoy an hour massage in there and was really relaxing. We also book a motorbike with them an move around Ubud with to discovery new places.

No sounds during the night apart from animals. Love this place and the people working in here. Than you guys our stay was very comfortable","BEWARE OF FAKE REVIEWS AND UNRELIABLE BOOKINGS (SHORT NOTICE CANCELLATION)

We booked this place after lots of research during high season in Bali.

Two days before our planned arrival, we were told we couldn’t stay there due to noise from a month long ceremony nearby (isn’t this something you would’ve known in advance?).

The manager attempted to move us to significantly downgraded accomodations from the same JJ group, which weren’t comparable at all. It felt like they never planned to have us stay at Doni House in the first place.

I have researched this manager’s listings and noticed that many of them indicated dodgy reviews and cancellations/moving people to other listings within their group.

Beware of fake reviews by the manager and employees of the JJ group. If you look more closely at these lovely reviews, at least 3 or 4, if not more of them, are FAKE to get good ratings.

In summary: Extremely unreliable host, short notice cancellation, stay away, and don’t trust their reviews..",Bathroom needs an update but beautiful views and room otherwise

Bebek Kayon,  signature dish of Balinese deep-fried crispy duck, a pepper beef and some banana fritters - all very good.

Afterwards the staff kindy showed us around, a short steep walk deeper into the forrest with an amazing waterfall.

Perfect location - town center is a quick ride away, still convenient, but it was really perfect to be outside of the hustle and bustle of Ubud. There are also waterfalls nearby and the owners, Subba and Renuka, are extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about providing recommendations and support for outings off the grounds.

You really feel like you’re smack in the middle of the jungle while luxuriating in the most beautiful accommodations, from the rooms to the infinity pool to the yoga pavilion.

The staff went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and enjoying my stay and I enjoyed the complimentary yoga every morning. My only regret is not staying longer. I won’t be making that mistake when I return, which I hope will be soon.

Thank you for making our last few days in Ubud super special and peaceful.","Stayed here with two friends for two nights and three days. We each had our own room and we ended up spending most of that time on the property after a few busy days in villas around Ubud before. The vegan food is incredibly fresh, healthy, flavorful, creative, and affordable. The owners are so open and generous, guiding us around the jungle paths and meditation hut and talking about their journey to creating this healing space. Local Balinese yoga instructors lead morning classes and there are occasional evening meditations. The design reflects a true reverence for the land here—you can easily take long walks in the fields or through the gardens where the food comes from. Also monkeys might pop by during breakfast :). I had a late flight and they let me extend my check out until I needed to leave that night which made my travel day so easeful. It was such a restorative stay and a perfect spot if you want somewhere that’s secluded.","the hotel feels like a jungly paradise away from the busyness of town center. there is daily yoga and meditation, and an extensive menu of veg/vegan food which is perfect for a little self-care retreat. the pool, room designs, and landscape is stunning. you can see monkeys in the treetops! the owners are also so kind and personable."

Pros: 10mins drive to Ubud Centre, Spacious room","We booked this place through Airbnb from 17th to 21st Sept’2023 for around 13,33,000 IDR.
The hosts were lovely.

Booking a hotel in the midst of nature yet centre of the city can be quite a task but not if you are planning to stay somewhere near Ubud coz Tegalalang is the perfect place amidst rice terrace and nature all around, where you will wake up to the clucking of hens. Its literally 6kms from Ubud market and still away from the hustle and bustle making it an ideal location if you wanna enjoy the serenity of the place. We were staying at UMAH NIK KEPITU which was a homestay taking care by a very friendly family who took care of everything. If you are a pet lover then this place is heaven for you as they have 4 dogs.And you have a lot of choices in Tegalalang ranging from resorts, hotels to air bnb depending on your preference you can opt for one. It’s a plus if you know how to ride a Scooty as transportation will be quite cheap. We used Grab bike taxi which was quite affordable.","Dear fellow travelers,

I recently had the pleasure of staying at this lovely homestay and wanted to share my thoughts. The owners were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making me feel right at home from the moment I arrived. The room itself was spacious and beautifully decorated, with all the amenities one could need for a comfortable stay.

However, I must note that the room was not very well isolated, and it felt like I was sleeping outside at times. The sound of the chickens crowing throughout the night and the loud morning ceremony that starts at 5 am could be a bit challenging for light sleepers. But if you don't mind sleeping in nature, it's definitely worth considering staying here.

On a positive note, the homestay has a few adorable dogs that are sure to brighten up your day. Overall, I would highly recommend staying here if you're looking for a unique and authentic experience, and don't mind a bit of noise from the surroundings.

Best regards"

The program is highly personalized, tailored to meet individual health needs in the most serene and beautifully designed surroundings.

The staff are not only carefully selected but are also experts in their fields, providing holistic care that makes you feel genuinely cared for.

I'm grateful for the short time I spent here, and I am eagerly looking forward to a longer visit next time.

Highly recommend this place for anyone seeking a comprehensive approach to health and wellness.","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Ayurvedagram Ubud for four nights to try it out though minimum recommended period is a week. It was truly a transformative experience.

From the moment I arrived, I was enveloped in a serene atmosphere that immediately put me at ease. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, ensuring that every aspect of my stay was perfect.

The Villa accommodations were spacious, clean, and beautifully designed, providing a tranquil sanctuary to relax and rejuvenate.

Each morning, I woke up feeling refreshed and energized, ready to embark on a day of wellness activities.

The Ayurvedic treatments offered at the resort were nothing short of exceptional. From personalized consultations with knowledgeable practitioners to indulgent massages and rejuvenating herbal therapies, every treatment was tailored to my specific needs and left me feeling balanced and restored.

The resort's lush surroundings added to the overall sense of tranquility, with stunning views of Ubud's natural beauty providing a serene backdrop to my stay.

Whether I was practicing yoga overlooking the rice paddies or enjoying a leisurely stroll through the tropical gardens, I felt completely immersed in nature's healing embrace.

The food at Ayurvedagram Ubud was another highlight of my stay. Each meal was thoughtfully prepared using fresh, organic ingredients sourced locally, and every bite was bursting with flavor and nourishment. The emphasis on Ayurvedic principles ensured that every dish supported my overall well-being, leaving me feeling nourished and satisfied.

Overall, my four nights at Ayurvedagram Ubud were truly transformative. I left feeling rejuvenated, recharged, and deeply grateful for the opportunity to experience such profound healing and relaxation. I can't recommend this resort highly enough to anyone seeking a holistic wellness retreat in the heart of Ubud.

Expat Indian and Other nationalities in Indonesia / neighbourhood this is a valuable option for you in your own backyard, on the Holy Island of Bali.","The only thing 5-star about this place are the prices they charge for the treatments. The place felt very dirty and unhygienic. The ladies giving the treatments, surya and dula were very sweet and polite (the only reason this place deserves 2 star service). I was asked to arrive 10 mins before my 7 am abyanga and shirodara, but there was no staff on site when i arrived at 6:45. I waited till 7:10 before someone came to take my blood pressure and by the time the actual treatments started it was 7:20am! I paid 145 euros for 90 minutes of treatment at a basic resort that deserves no more than a 3 star rating. The treatment rooms looked old and need lots of renovation. The bathroom was mouldy and the cloth provided after the shower was very ugly. The abyanga massage itself lasted about 25 mins after all the formalities of changing and praying etc.. the shirodara treatment was very relaxing but paying 90 euros for 30 mins of oil on your head in Bali is a bit excessive. Treatment rooms are close to the road so you hear all the traffic noise while trying to relax and on top of that a phone was ringing for a while during the shirodara treatment. As a qualified ayurvedic therapist with many years experience receiving such treatments at other places, i was not impressed at all by the value for money.  After the treatments i asked for a 10% discount for the time i had to wait, but they refused and after another 10 minutes discussion they agreed to 5% discount. What i found most appalling for such a spiritual place was that they charged another 2% as “credit card” fees” after taking off the 5% discount claiming that was standard practice although i know this is not so!  so actually it was only a 3% discount. I hoped for a 5 star facilities and service but arrived to an old, dirty, run down place. Unfortunately this place seems to be run by greedy owners not interested in feedback from the client or improving clients experience. And the pictures on google are very old.","It's a planet of peace and happiness, which emanates from our inner selves. One should not just visit here once; it's a place to make one's permanent residence. Thanks to the management for developing this artistic space and providing mindful food in accordance with Ayurveda. Special thanks to the chefs and Dr. Natasha for guiding us on food and beverages tailored to our body's nature.","Amazing place in Ubud! Incredibly beautifully preserved nature.
Ayurvedic Doctor Naatasha is very dedicated and lovely.
Staff is gentle and very helpful."

A restaurant with a good view.

The mie goreng was overly fishy and the beef rendang was pretty bland. If you are staying at the attached resort it’s worth going to if you are feeling lazy, but otherwise there are definitely better options.","This is our second trip to Aruna.Great, fresh meals here.

on the other hand, for my taste, the music is much too loud, sometimes the sounds of instruments are repeated for hours, it's not necessarily pleasant when you want to rest

I had tom yum and felt like I was in Thailand eating it. Reason for not a 5* is because they use plastic straws still. Seems like a big well going place. We've been to such smaller restaurants and they still provide anti plastic items. Hopefully this restaurant will take on the new times soon.

Homestay situated in a more local area so its not that easy to walk out and find food like the area near monkey forest. So I actually ate in the homestay which the Indonesian food like mie goreng, nasi goreng were so good. I had a good rest for the 3 nights there.","This homestay is a hidden gem. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking an authentic and memorable Balinese experience. It will immerse you in the local culture, language, and traditions. Each day starts with sounds of chickens and temple chimes. The location is just steps away from a sacred water temple, surrounded by lush green rice fields and temples. The local Balinese community is kind, open, and humble, always welcoming with a smile. I was so captivated by this experience that I extended my stay from 5 nights to a whole month!

The family who runs this place is amazing. They know the area and can provide excellent recommendations for anything you need. I even had the best massage right in the comfort of my own room. You can organise everything directly with the family, from motorbike rental to site visits, etc. They will even take you to the local market and teach you how to cook Balinese food at home. Each day out exploring you come home to a beautiful clean room.

I'm extremely grateful for this experience and feeling a bit sad that the month is coming to an end…. Terima kasih Umah Nik Family!","I spent 2 night at this amazing homestay and the experience was enriching to my soul. Food was fresh and delicious, everything we required was offered from them. I was looking for traditional experiences and tried to avoid crowed places. I found this family who allowed me to clean my body and soul in a sacred and secret temple. I simply loved it. Family is so nice, the owner is such as wonderful soul too.
Thanks:)","Highly DO NOT recommend this place, even for one night, if you want to relax in silence and have a good night's sleep.  All night long roosters will crow, dogs will howl, and at 5 in the morning prayer will be turned on in the temple.

And after complaining to the manager Nick that he didn’t warn about this in advance before paying, he will tell you to get out of the room at 8 in the morning, although you paid, and go to your country, because all tourists are disgusting and crazy. Or pay him 15 mln Rp then he will give you proper service. I have not seen such rudeness in Bali for a 7 years.

By the way, his family, very friendly and hospitable, they apologized and returned the money, but I did not take them, as I somehow tried to spend the night there. But I won't be back.","Place is wonderful. All the reviews are exact. The family could not possibly be any happier to have you as their people in their village. So welcoming. Me and Umah went to the temple and bathed while getting a massage and doing some water yoga. He also took us to the famous coffee and tea shop. Wanted to spend so much more time but we was running out of time. But lovely people, lovely free breakfast, coffee was on time, and the room was probably the biggest room I had stayed in Asia. The garden was fantastic. Everything perfect."
