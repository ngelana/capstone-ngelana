Highly recommend. The lunch wasn't great but the elephants definitely made up for it, as did the scenery and being able to feed them fruits and vegetables.","Only the elephant ride is worth the fee. The elephant guide very professional. The elephant ride was beautiful.
The car driver was helpful and friendly taking photos of us. But the place itself as a building was ready to be demolished with the ceiling falling. Awful food. Warm soft drinks. Not recommended.","If you want to ride an elephant then this is the place. You can really get close and personal... We rode Laura and she was wonderful. The guide was very professional and the location is wonderful, although you feel more like you are in Africa and not in Bali... I do think it's a bit pricey but I also understand that maintaining such large animals is not cheap. Beautiful place and highly recommend it. Btw, the Balinese food we had there was wonderful...","The elephant ride was really good, didn't go white water rafting... next time.","Had a great day river rafting.
Great easy rafting for easy level day."

Got to ride Laura and Andrew and they were both very well behaved and listened to the guide well. Laura picked grass/food on our tour which was fine as no different to riding my horse out. Elephants had plenty of food and loved their scratches.  Thanks again :)","Not worth it.
We wanted to try elephant ride. Well.
Actually what I enjoy - was only feeding them. There are too many animals in small cages :(
You feel really pity for them:(
Monkeys have no place to walk and spend all time and life there:(
During elephant road - elephant timer was persistently hinted that we need to pay him extra. He said like he with his friend are volunteers and they are saving money to buy food for elephants. I said him, I bought my food as well. But he repeated this information about food for elephants 3 times. I‚Äôl tell you what was he speaking. ‚ÄúWe have 10 elephants, 3 of them died because of bad food and because there is not enough of food for animals in zoo ‚Äù. I was like ‚Äú what ? Not enough fruits in Indonesia?He said me like ‚Äúwe have very big competition with other zoo, that‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt have enough food from market‚Äù. Kinda don‚Äôt believe this information - because for locals to buy fruits in bulk is cheap.
So this man had 2 ways to ask money: 1)when he ask it for photo
2) when he was telling this sad story about zoo.
This zoo always has customers, i checked dates - it‚Äôs full.But he wants to take money from nothing. Why after paying 80$ for zoo I should pay extra to this man? After this weird story we fed the elephants with our food and after Indonesian woman came to us with fruits(we need to buy) and feed another timeü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Elephants are extra cute!
But one ride is totally enough.","Rafting.   Didn‚Äôt realise it was part of a zoo.  Rafting was fun but the walk down was very slippery, two of our group fell on the rocks.  The actual rafting was fun and the guides fun‚Ä¶. As we were the first group down the river that day we came across many fallen trees across the river, surely it would be easier to send someone down each morning before paying customers‚Ä¶ we spent time waiting whilst they cut and removed the trees.

The trip back to the resort was in the back of an open truck, quite uncomfortable.  The changing rooms/showers were just awful, poor water flow, mouldy walls, bare electric wires/bulbs over the shower, we didn‚Äôt bother showering as would of felt dirtier.  The lunch provided in the price was very basic.  Although I didn‚Äôt go to the area that was the zoo I did see apes in small enclosures above the main building‚Ä¶ so sad!  3 stars for the guys that took us rafting and picked up those that fell!!! 1 star for the company/zoo/showers","Its a shame that people support this kind of animal abuse for their own selfish needs and entertainment.

And its a shame that its still allowed to ride on elephants!
Elephants get beaten up ,chained up and tortured and you selfish tourist go and pay for it!","Please read ‚Äúholidays that harm ‚Äú before visiting any venue with elephants.

It was the best way to experience the rainforest and lots of little water falls coming from the mountains. Our guides were hilarious and really made the experience my favourite Bali memory. There were lots of drops but nothing too scary for the kids who had an absolute ball. Highly recommend.,"Good place, forest, river & there are monkeys üêí","Riding elephants is extremely inhumane! They are tortured into submission for your mediocre entertainment. Please stop supporting this cruel treatment of beautiful, intelligent creatures. They deserve as better life as much as you do.",Nice river,Awesome place
