We were impressed with the quality and location of this hotel.

Very easy to get out and about to explore on foot, and as it’s such a large hotel it’s nice to escape the busyness of it.

We went for the bed and breakfast option and what a nice offering of choice each morning. Certainly didn’t leave hungry!

It was a nice, friendly and pleasant stay for us all.","We absolutely loved our stay at Hyatt Regency. After 24 hours of flight time, it was great to have seamless transport from the airport that was arranged by the hotel, and a warm greeting and delicious welcome drink from the staff. We also received a room upgrade, which was a nice surprise (we have elite status with both Marriott and Hilton hotels and do not always get an upgrade this nice.)
The grounds are beautiful, the staff has 5 star hospitality and the hotel is in a convenient location with many restaurants and cafes nearby. We loved our stay so much we extended it an extra day.","4 short days on this trip to celebrate our anniversary and we're very glad we made Hyatt Regency our home. Fantastic location that is close to many cafes and great spas. Loved the ability to lounge beachfront and the long boardwalk by the beach. Daily breakfast was yummy with consistently great coffee too! The incredible staff in f&b and housekeeping were so friendly, efficient ,multi-lingual and their lovely smile really made such a difference.  On our last night at the beach bbq, one of the servers also doubled up as the emcee for the evening - deftly introducing us to the various traditional dances of Bali.","Had a lovely stay at the Hyatt.  My room was lovely and clean and I had a great view of the beach.
The grounds are stunning to walk around.  Loved the loungers on the beach,  nice and peaceful.
Easy walk along beach path to so many great beach side restaurants.
Would definitely stay again.","One of the original resorts in Bali, dating back to the early 1970s, Hyatt Regency Bali is a beautiful complex full of lily ponds, gardens, courtyards and shade trees. It also has a fine collection of statues. The lush grounds attract lots of bird life.

The rooms are spacious with lots of Balinese nuances. Some of them have sea views and others have garden views. The complex also has a couple of different restaurants and a large club lounge. Food is very good at all these venues and service is professional. Staff wear traditional attire, which gives a nice touch as well."

Such a beautiful resort - so peaceful and relaxing.
The food is incredible. We were expecting buffet but it's actually unlimited a la carte - all so delicious. Fantastic coffee too! I had so many that I found it hard to lie relax by the pool.
The best part is the location. It backs right onto the beach and there's a path that runs along it, shaded by trees so you can walk during the day. And the front of the resort is the main street with lots of restaurants and massage places.
Only negative is the hard beds. But if you like hard beds - there are no negatives.
We will definitely be back!","This is a great place to stay in Sanur.  This was a very relaxed and quiet place to stay.  The pool was relaxing and it had some interesting toys readily available to use.
The room was spacious and clean we loved the amenities of the room and it was great to see that they had a HDMI port for the TV as a wall socket so we didn't have to fiddle around behind the TV to attach our device.
The food here was superb, breakfast menu was interesting as it is not a buffet but a made to order small plates.  You have to try the dishes of the day (which changed each day) and try all the signature dishes.  Everything was delicious and loved the friendly service of everyone there. In room dining was great also having 24 hour service for food.
There is a kids club, but we did not take advantage of that as we had some day activities planned already, but reading through the activities it would have been great for kids.","My wife and I chose this as one of our honeymoon holiday stays. We stayed 5 nights in April and were absolutely blown away. Andaz is classy and refined. The breakfasts are a highlight with the a la carte style and unlimited orders. The resort is big and spacious and manicured perfectly. We loved the large pool and the fisherman's club restaurant. The beachfront was clean and free from vendors. walking along the beach provided options of jet skiing, fishing and had restaurants, the resort also provided free bikes for use. There were a lot of children, mostly well behaved, and a hands kids club seemed to mostly occupy them","The best spot in Bali if you have kids and want to relax. I'd rate it 6/5 if I could! The hotel is super kid friendly and only 30 mins at most from the airport. I loved the pool and easy access to the beach. Bali is getting so much hotter nowadays that having a well insulated room with AC is crucial. The inside of the room is also so well thought of with a great bathtub.
The only feedback is that the bathroom door makes a pretty big sound which isn't great when the kids are asleep.
Definitely would consider coming back!!","This resort was incredible. The food was amazing, the room was beautiful, and the amenities were wonderful. I cannot say enough great things about the experience we had at Andaz Bali. It was well worth the journey from the US. The resort was well maintained and tranquil while still offering plenty of activities. Also, we also felt incredibly safe the entire time we were in the resort.

I cannot compliment the staff enough either. They were wonderful during our stay and extremely friendly. They truly elevated the experience over any other resorts we have visited in recent memory. Their attentiveness and care during our stay was refreshing, and we greatly appreciated them."

Staff were very friendly however the rooms are in need of some maintenance as they are abit run down. The bathroom smelt and there wasn’t enough light in the room. The pool was nice and I liked that you ordered breakfast from a menu as I prefer this than having a buffet.,"We stayed at Abian Harmony for 5nights, we enjoyed our stay and the hospitality are great !! Helpful stuff, the location just right in the center where you can catch good restaurants and coffee cafe. Reasonable price , room quite big. I would recommend for those who look for a good budget hotel.  ( to be mentioned, the smell from the drainage quite strong if you not run the water)","I stayed a week with a girlfriend we had separate rooms and separate experiences with those rooms. This is an aging hotel, but keep in mind when Covid hit all money dried up and no wages could be paid or refurbishments could be done. They are now in the process of slowly making it better.
My room had 2 king single beds which was enough for me. I had a balcony I didn't use, except to dry my swimwear. The mattress for me was very hard, not what I'm used to. I brought my own pillow so can't comment on the ones there. The sheets did have slight staining, but I also think this has a lot to do with the water quality in general. The bathroom had a musty odour but everything worked well enough. There is a safe so that works and ample hanging space. The little fridge is great and keeps things cold, the air conditioner works beautifully. We were on the 2nd floor and had 2 ways to get to our rooms.
The breakfast was a choice of salad, fresh cut fruit, cook your own toast, and off the menu. The local coffee is not to my taste so I drank Americano instead.
We used the spa facility once for a foot massage and that was a nice enough experience.
We spent a lot of time in the pool, I enjoyed being in there, due to the humidity.
This hotel is close to other restaurants, bars, shops, doctor, chemist, money changers. The beach is 500 metres away and an easy walk.
Even though this hotel is on the old side, I think they can get it up to a better standard in time.
The absolute standout is the staff. They are fantastic, every single one of them. Their happiness and friendliness was so welcoming. If we had a question they had an answer or found it out.
Are there better hotels, yes of course, are there worse, yes there too. So this is in the middle, the price we paid was absolutely fair for what we got, breakfast was included so that helped.
I had a great holiday.","First of all I want to give a shout out to Arsa Yasa who went way above and beyond to make my son and myself feel accommodated, comfortable and even special. He treated us as if we were family and he's one reason we will definitely be back. The rest of the staff were very friendly as well and the breakfast at this hotel was one of the best on our whole month journey around Bali. Good location not far from the ferries.","I don’t see any good reason to stay here when there are so many other places for a similar price that are much nicer. We felt the photos of the rooms were very misleading (deluxe double)

Our room sucked. It was old, absolutely no ambience whatsoever. The walls were cracked and worn, the bathroom was… just odd? Like a small grey dungeon.

The room was clean at least. But I didn’t wanna spend a second longer there than I had to.

The hallways to the rooms don’t smell great. The decor is bad. There’s like pamphlets by the TV of how much you’ll be charged if anything is damaged. But honestly, the towels are like already ripped along the bottom stitching. And the bathroom towels look ripped in half.

Our room was close to the elevator and all night long every few minutes we were lucky enough to hear the clunking of the lift mechanics. Very loud CLUNK.

The room was noisy, we could hear so much stuff all around us.

The staff were were kind, welcoming and accomodating and the welcome drink was delicious. It was easy and cheap to book a driver to the airport. The pool was nice.

But this is the only good things I can say about this place. We booked a quick one night stay here on our way home, I wish I booked somewhere else.

Stay somewhere else."

But then my order never came, and I had to remind them. But I had no proof that I had paid 44,000 Rp, so oh well, treat it as tip then.
There is parking outside and a parking attendant to help control traffic. The restaurant is already considered not too dirty. The waiters are helpful.",Nice traditional bakso joint in Sanur area. The taste is good for the price. I would recommend to order two portions of bakso without any noodles as one portions is too little for me and the noodles are not that good.,"One delicious meatball. Juicy meat and broth, but too much fat oil, perhaps it's clearer during the opening hours. One moderate portion that's perfect for less heavy meal. Casual place with endless patrons coming in and out. A little bit cramp that I got nudged few times by servers. Quick serving and cheap.

As other reviews have mentioned, there are areas where some TLC would improve the general appearance, but I think given the price point it’s a very good hotel. Bed is sizeable and comfortable, The TVs in the room are sizable and have Netflix, Prime, etc. AC works. Rooms are cleaned everyday and they supply you with a couple of bottles of water everyday. The pool could do with a scrub, but it’s usable. Breakfast tasted good; personally, I found the à la carte option preferable as the food was hotter compared to the buffet style.

Regarding the busy road, there is a zebra crossing towards Naughty Nuri’s (exit left outside of the hotel). It’s about a 10-minute walk. Another option is to cross and jump onto the island in the middle. There is a turnaround spot just outside the hotel (a gap in the island), but this can be quite manic. Crossing here requires extra caution. If you want to avoid it all together grab taxis should suffice.

Also you can’t hear the road from the rooms which is obviously a great positive.","I had a wonderful experience during my stay at Abisha. The hotel boasts a strategic location, being close to both the beach and the city center. The accessibility was convenient, and I found the services and facilities to be commendable. The staff provided excellent service, and the amenities were up to par. Additionally, the pricing was reasonable, making it a great value for the overall experience. I highly recommend Abisha for those seeking a comfortable and affordable accommodation with a prime location.","SCAM ALERT! DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!
Me and my fiancé booked this hotel for 26 nights and I don’t know where to begin. First and foremost, you cannot enjoy the pool at all because there are SWIMMING LESSONS 2 times a day. Yeah you heard it right. Starting sometimes from 7-9 in the morning and then in the afternoon aswell. 2-8 kids in the pool screaming, splashing and bringing full equipment into the pool with 1 teacher for each kid.
Nr.2 The personnel and manager and owner do not listen to any complaints and they don’t care about you. The owner/manager asked ME to give other people WARNINGS since he didn’t wanna do it himself.
Nr.3 All the photos are misleading, it’s nothing like it looks on the pictures. The rooms are moldy and very rundown. They’re tricking you with the pictures but it’s not even the same hotel.
Nr.4 Other people that stayed there came to me, begging me for help and slipping letters under my door cause some rooms had 10 people in them drinking, smoking and partying all night and the staff didn’t care at all. Even tough several people did let them know.
Nr.5 The rooms are so bad you can hear a mosquito in the room next door, that doesn’t help with the sleep I promise you that. Guarantee NO SLEEP.
Nr.6 the breakfast is insanely overpriced and not a buffet, you are lucky if you get a more goreng or nasi goreng.
We had to check out earlier even tough we prepaid for the room cause it’s a mad house. And we were not the only ones, there 4 other rooms that did check out earlier because they couldn’t take it anymore. MADNESS! DO NOT BOOK!","Not worth it! Room smelt like a sewer. The smell was so bad you could taste it! Damp and mould growing on the walls. After 5 minutes of sitting on the bed, myself and my friend were itching our skin raw. We ended up needing to leave the room as the itching was unbearable. The bathroom is a terrible lay out, water went all over the floor. Pool was green and slimy, needs attention. We ordered a club sandwich which was cold and stale. DO NOT RECOMMEND.","Love the staff.
Room smelt of sewerage and mould. It was infested with mosquitoes too.
Ordered Fish and Chips and the fish was off. Inedible.
Service recovery was great. This space has great staff.

One suggestions - I felt a little rushed. I am aware you are closing 22:00 but playing hard rock music and clearing up at 21:30 is a clear sign to ‘get out’. If you close at 22:00 please at least keep the ambience going till closing.

Thank you","Great location, super amazing food, cocktails and juices. Lovely roof top bar and aircon in upstairs dinning area. Super friendly staff and always super delicious fresh food. Never had  an issue getting Bali belly from these days. Lovely place to eat, get a cuppa or a cocktail. Highly recommended if staying in Sanur.

White two stories building nested in the main street of Danau Tamblingan which make it easy to find. The first fl for outdoor and second fl is indoor with a lot of window and an outdoor terrace.

Food is really good and don't think you will make a wrong choice in here. The service is also outstanding and the place is very cozy. Overall very recommended to try this chic place.

Btw, no parking space as most of place in Bali and better make recommendation if you plan to visit  it in high traffic time/ day.","Good food, great location, reasonably priced. To put in a perspective it’s like having a 5-star hotel breakfast with a fraction of the price. Well picked ingredients, great measured portion, attentive staffs, cooked to perfection; the full circle.
Would definitely book my hotel without breakfast and have it here instead 👌🏻","We visited this wonderful bistro for lunch.

Since I'm vegan, but not pure vegetarian, so this is fine for me. Specially, they have more than 10 choices of veges. Taste are all local flavours.

Even Tempe has few different way of cooking. Cassava is also there as usual. And sambal Matah is also available. Long beans and black mushroom also available. Cold drinks and soft drinks are available.

I also checked their menu. Some other orders are there. Not just the ready choices on the counter.

Located close to Duyung beach in Sanur, this warung is literally small with limited seating area. There are two ways of choosing meals, you can choose variety of cooked foods from the stall or hot meals from the menu. Hot meals might took a while as they will cook it fresh after receiving your order. Their babi kecap is definitely worth to try! It comes with rice and big portions of meat. I added vegetables from the stall (cold but the taste is still nice).","Went here for the famous Nasi Campur for bule they said. The selection of vegetables and meat is various. I'd suggest you buy their corn bakwan, it's so crunchy and sweet. Other than Nasi Campur, they also serve panini and salad. I'd say the taste was okay and not too strong for bule. They have desserts too, like cake and pastry.

The place is a bit small. I think it might fit only up to 10 people in the room. The price is on the pricey side compared to other similar warung that sells nasi campur."

We spent nine wonderful nights at this hotel and were thoroughly impressed. Here are our impressions:

Rooms and Gardens: The rooms and gardens are truly beautiful. The tasteful decor and well-maintained green spaces contributed to a relaxed atmosphere. The incredible size of the rooms and outdoor area deserves special mention. We felt extremely comfortable in them.
The hotel is small and we barely ever noticed the presence of any other guest, this adds a lot to the overall private feel you have while enjoying your villa.

Pool: The pool was a real highlight! We enjoyed refreshing ourselves in the cool water while admiring the surrounding landscape.

Hotel Staff: The entire hotel staff was extremely courteous and friendly. They always respected our privacy and ensured that we felt completely at ease.

Breakfast Service: The fact that breakfast is available all day and can even be delivered to the room is an additional plus. Flexibility and comfort are essential aspects of a successful hotel stay.
Overall, our stay here was an unforgettable experience. We wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and look forward to our next visit!","We stayed here for a week and glad that we avoided popular Bali resorts. This is a beautiful place ~lush green and gives you peace and time to reflect, away from the hustle bustle of touristy busy resorts.
Staff and the team at Kayumanis are the best. Always smiling, happy and eager to help! They even sourced soybean crackers for us from local market.
Private pool and big gazebo were our favourite spots.
Property is nicely maintained and minimalist yet sufficient.

If you want peace, tranquility and top notch service - try this. You won’t be disappointed.

6/5","We came here to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary and vacation during holiday break and could not be happier. Downtown Sanur is so quaint and inviting. Amazing restaurants and shops!! The Villas offer a complimentary shuttle service daily until 5pm. The food here is spectacular. They deliver breakfast to your villa or you can enjoy in the restaurant. The property is small, but absolutely luxurious and beautiful. The villa was amazing and exceeded our expectations. We felt so pampered here. The pool was a perfect way to enjoy the afternoon. The employees were so kind, professional and amazing. The spa is fantastic and I highly recommend you book a massage with facial. Would definitely recommend this property and would definitely stay here again. One of our favorite stays in Southeast Asia. I love this property and hope to come back❤️","My family and I recently spent an unforgettable few nights at Kayumanis Sanur Private Villa & Spa in November. Nestled in the heart of Bali, this serene retreat exceeded our expectations in every way possible.

Accommodation: With a 4-month-old baby in tow, comfort and convenience were paramount. The villa was not just spacious but also exuded a sense of tranquillity that put us all at ease. The amenities were meticulously designed, and the thoughtful arrangements made us feel right at home.

Service: The hallmark of Kayumanis Sanur is undoubtedly its exceptional service. Every member of the staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was flawless. Their attention to detail and genuine warmth made our experience truly special.

Dining: The culinary offerings were a delight. From local flavours to international cuisines, the food was not just delicious but also catered perfectly to varying palates. The quality and presentation were commendable, adding an extra layer of indulgence to our stay.

Ambiance: Being the oldest among the Kayumanis properties in Bali, it holds a unique charm. The tranquillity enveloping the entire resort made it an ideal sanctuary for a relaxing holiday. The well-manicured gardens and serene atmosphere were a balm for the soul.

Recommendation: We wholeheartedly recommend Kayumanis Sanur to anyone seeking a rejuvenating getaway in Bali. Its blend of comfort, impeccable service, and serene ambiance makes it an ideal choice, especially for families seeking relaxation without compromising on luxury.","We’ve just come back after a fantastic stay at the villas.  It was for my partner’s 70th birthday and we certainly got the luxury treatment of a personal chef and barbeque, a candle lit garden and pool, etc.
The rooms and gardens were beautiful, the food was fantastic and the massages we had at the spa are highly recommended.  The staff were polite and friendly and the service great.
The pool was huge for a private villa. We will definitely be back."

The meat tasted a bit funny and the guacamole was not good.
The atmosphere inside is okay but outside is a lot nicer.
The staff were friendly and helpful","18.3.2024 Mexican style restaurant. Expectations based on first impression were high. I don't know if they have a restroom because there was no need to use one.

Food: Nachos with marinated shredded chicken. Was liked but did not stand out as anything unforgettable. Salad with marinated shredded chicken. The salad was really nice. It had spices and a nice flavor. Based of other experiences with mexican foods a solid 3/5.

Service: staff was polite and handled the whole process from start to finish as expected. 4/5.

Atmosphere: A family friendly place. It was an ok setup all around. Good for a lunch. I would probably seek for another place for dinner though. 3/5.

Be aware that they add +15% to the prices. Pricing is maybe mid-high in this area (Sanur). It is a nice experience worth visiting. Overall, the food, service and atmosphere,  it's a 3/5.","There aren’t many Mexican restaurants / options in Bali. Coming from California, Mexican food is the one cuisine I miss the most from back home that I feel like I can’t get easily on the island. This is the best Mexican restaurant I’ve come across so far. Great service, veggie options for protein, and nice chic interior. Will be coming back soon 🤲🏽 P.S. the horchata had a perfect level of sweetness, worth a try if that’s your thing. Stay well always 🦥","Want to give a 4.5 but not an option. 4 too low and 5 too high. The carne asada and beer battered fish tacos were fantastic. The beef tacos edge the fish tacos. The grilled chicken nachos were good as well but topping to chip ratio off (lot more toppings than chips). Also ordered the carne asada kids quesadilla—just meat and cheese, so if your kids are picky eaters, it’s perfect!"

Our booking also included breakfast which is a set menu with a choice of a few different entries, it was very tasty and satisfying.

Really good value - it was a joy to discover this property.
This hotel is old style Bali and just perfect for a stay in Sanur.
Excellent location, quiet, walking distance to fabulous dining, shopping and beach.
I choose this hotel as my number on place in Sanur and after my 3 night stay here will be back every time I trek from Canggu to peaceful Sanur.
Cannot express my gratitude enough. Thanks guys!","To arrived at this hotel with my 5month old and 7year old and the room smelt so bad of mould upon entering the room. I then saw black mould in the walls. When I mentioned to staff they wiped this off however the smell was so potent it was hard to breathe. The replacement they offered was also mould ridden. The hotel refused to refund or offer a room without mould.
I had to leave and book another hotel as it was soooooo bad. Very poor they refused to refund even though I had photo evidence and they admitted the rooms have black mould.","The location is your on Sanur,but the  resort,is not maintained, so bad,because could be a marvelous  one.
One point very disappointing  is the smokers,are every rooms,no sections,so you cannot seat on your outdoor space,it is disgusting  😕.
The shower  has a drip,no flow ,the linens old,should be replaced.

* Fresh lemonade 45,000
* Guacamole 55,000
* Chorizo compapas 45000 (spicy chorizo sausage with fried potatoes)
* Tacos carne asada 35,000 * 2 (tacos with beef)
* Tacos Baja California 30000x 2 (Fried fish tacos)
* Tacos Chicken Adobo 30000x 2 (Chicken Tacos)
* Churros 45000
* Tortilla chips ->  maybe mistaken for salsa & chips for 40000 rupiah
Total 577170 rupiah = JPY5,596

I especially liked the guacamole, chips, and churros there. The churros were freshly fried and came with vanilla ice cream and plenty of chocolate sauce. It was sprinkled with cinnamon, so the adults probably enjoyed it more than kids did. The guacamole was homemade with fresh avocado and was not spicy, but I could have eaten as much as I wanted with the chips. My daughter loved the chips and the tortilla part of the tacos and ate a lot of them. The sauce was not too spicy, so even my 4 year-old daughter was able to eat the chips with the sauce. The service throughout the restaurant was very nice and the gentleman who probably owns the place was very friendly and pleasant and most food was delicious, and we were very happy to have Mexican food after a long time.
*We are heavy repeaters to Cancun who used to go there every year before Covid
-19 pandemic. Although the overall spiciness of the food was quite moderate or not spicy at all,  it was still tasty and probably better for family guests or other guests in Sanur.
Highly recommended!","I found Jalapeno as a good option for Mexican restaurant in Sanur area. I ordered Nachos, Jalapeno, and iced long black.

I liked the interior, felt like I wasn't in Bali for a moment.

The nachos was really delicious with their rich sauces, crispy corn chips, and the tender tasty pork meat (optional).

Their iced Long Black was nice, the coffee aroma and taste were fit to my like (Not too acidic)

Some staffs were really welcoming and accomodating. I really appreciate their service.

I walked to this restaurant. The restaurant is located just beside the 2 lanes road.

I would definitely come back to try their burrito.","The place is very nice! We've passed through the road for so many years but never hadthe chance to go here because its always full. When we finally had the chance to go here for a lateunch, the experience didn't dissapoint. The food was great! We tried their carnitas, tacos and fajitas and a couple of their small bites. Oh wow! The taste is so sublime and authentic! Coupled woth their margharitas and its just perfect. Really recommend to meet with UJ who is very friendly and attentive during your visit! Good luck UJ and the rest of the crew! Definitely will come back for more to Jalapeno!","If you're in the mood for some delicious Mexican bites, this restaurant is definitely worth a stop. The food was good - small bites that were reasonably priced. We highly recommend asking for the spice to give your meal an extra kick. Additionally, the cocktail selection was impressive, and the bartender was clearly proud of their craft. We enjoyed their cocktail recommendations along with our meal. While the space may be on the smaller side, it's cozy and has a great vibe. Overall, we had a great experience and would recommend this spot to those looking for a tasty and budget-friendly Mexican meal with a good cocktail to match."

Sangria had a nice kick to it. Fantastic service too. Wish there were more places like this!!,"The best food and service! Day 2 in Bali and I wanted seafood. Found Pescado through Goggle Reviews. The place is so nice and clean and I was greeted immediately by the nicest staff. I told Bayu I liked seafood and he made some recommendations. I got the scallops, and some clams in green sauce. It was the best clams I’ve ever had! He said most tourists like the Mussels with Citrus but clams with green sauce was more traditional Balinese. It did not disappoint! I cleared both my scallops and clams and wishing I had more. The clams also came with some delicious and perfectly toasted bread. I also wanted paella and I was going to get seafood but Bayu said the beef one was really good and the photo convinced me so I ordered it. Wow!!! So amazing. Specially with mixed with the aioli.

Finally I wanted a drink like white linen but with vodka. I noticed that the Spicy lady drink was what I was looking for except with cucumber instead of Chili pepper. They made it for me and again, amazing! Ask for the Cool Lady instead :)

Once I asked for my check, they brought out chocolate truffle on the house.

I’ll be coming back for the mussels before I end my holiday in Bali.

Suksma Pescado!","Definitely a must try Spanish restaurant in Sanur area. Great food and they have variety wine options if you are into it.

Great taste and high quality food. The desserts taste also great as well. Depending on day, it will dictate how crowd it is, so better make reservations.

They have indoor and outdoor sitting area, in my opinion both options are good.

Overall good experience and recommended if you are in Sanur area.","Highly recommend eating at Pescados. Food was flawless with generous seafood servings and unique flavours as well as perfect presentation. Cocktails were delicious and used multiple ingredients to bring a level above anything we had at the nearby resorts. And lastly atmosphere and service was spot on, attentive but not intruding.","Not the cheapest in Sanur and Not the most expensive but if you like good quality European food it rates up there with the best in our opinion.
Both air conditioned and outside dining available. Our two furries were allowed thank you.
The scallops and croquettes and garlic prawns were simply devine.
The Barra fish and also the Beef cheeks did not disappoint either.
The staff were extremely competent, friendly and helpful.
Ironic we went from dining at a Warung style establishment that had been booked but was shut to here at Pescado. Only in Bali."

You will need a scooter or you can get grabs to get about but it’s only a 5 min drive from everything and being slightly further out means it’s super quiet at night.

For example, we asked for a mixer to prepare some food for the little one and the next day it was there already. The communication via Airbnb and live is perfect.

I highly recommended to try the Balinese white wine you won’t be disappointed, super fresh and citrusy on flavor.
