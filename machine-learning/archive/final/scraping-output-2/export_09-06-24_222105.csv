We were welcomed by Sari, a very kind, friendly and helpful person.

The rooms and the pool (new, clean facilities) were impressive for the local conditions and served us well.

What made our stay even more was the delicious breakfast with a gorgeous view and Sari sharing with us the variety of fruit that literally grows on the breakfast terrace (passionfruit, mangosteen, sapodilla, duku).

Good stuff, thank you Sari!","I was there last month !
I was apprehensive before booking.. I do not deny that some of the comments are accurate, but Mrs. Sari and her brother  Deki have a great tolerance for listening to criticism and striving to change for the better: For example, when we criticised the breakfast meal, which consisted of eggs and toast, on the second day, there was a variety in the breakfast.
Unfortunately, we did not change the currency and were not able to leave a tips, even though these people in these areas suffered as a result of the quarantine and need help because they depend a lot on tourism.The family and the locals of the area are all very kind, cheerful and helpful as well.
Don't miss the good relaxing massages at very reasonable prices at Mandhasativa homestay! Book it with Sari in advance.
The place is comfortable, especially in the early morning. I take the opportunity to thank the whole family for their good reception, and I do not regret the stay, because the place compared to the prices, as I mentioned, is very suitable, and I hope to stay again in the same place.","We stayed here for a week and had higher expectations to be honest. The sink in our room was broken so that water was dripping everywhere and we always had to clean it up. The room isn’t as new as shown in the Fotos, there was mold in the bathroom and a lot of dust everywhere. The The pool was dirty even after it was cleaned. The loungers by the pool were really dirty and not welcoming to lay there. Sari was really nice and welcoming. Breakfast was ok (not even butter for the toast, just plain toast and egg). But of all things we didn’t appreciate Deka giving our number to his nephew without asking us, because the nephew was a guide to sekumpul waterfall. Out of the blue a random number was calling us (his nephew) and asking us when we were coming to sekumpul waterfall and we never agreed to take him as a guide. Deka offered it and we said we will think about it. We didn’t like that.","Niluh Sari, the host, is the best and very welcoming! (It would be best if you speak bahasa a little). The atmosphere is very serene, you don’t hear any noise from the road, and the dinner on sunset roof terrace is memorable. It’s 20 minutes to waterfalls by transport but worth it, the climate is better. We’ll be back ❤️","Amazing homestay. Staff are so friendly and polite, breakfast was great, location fantastic. Couldn't fault it. Will definitely go back."
