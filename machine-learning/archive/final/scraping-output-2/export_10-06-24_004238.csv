Food were good, service was fast, staff were friendly.

You have to pay Rp 150,000/person to enter, which you can exchange for food and drinks or to use the pool.

I think the only thing that sort of disturbed us was the very loud music, which sort of ruined the relaxing atmosphere of the place.",What an amazing place! One of the best I've visited in Bali. We were so lucky to come in the morning and not have anyone inside. The entrance fee is 150k (50k is for the towel and 100k goes towards consumption). Very nice service. I would return back (and I hope I will).,"My partner and I travelled 1 1/2 hours from Seminyak to this amazing place. At first I was hesitant to travel here but it is well worth the travel. The road is safe , with just a steep area for the 100 meters up. It has the most amazing views, the pool is warm and has a deep end. It was very peaceful and relaxing. We loved  the nasi goreng which was very reasonably priced and Ketut made my partner and I delicious cocktails.
The service is friendly and prompt. You will need to pay an entry fee of about $100,000 rupiah but it is well worth the spend and you will get a rebate on your drinks and food.
A definite must visit, the most beautiful place and loved all the decor monkeys !","This place is a must for us when we visit Bali.
Spectacular infinity pool on the side of a mountain. So peaceful & serene.
$15 entry includes a towel & $10 food voucher.","Great spot, pay to enter but this includes towels and a swim and you get most off your lunch. Amazing infinity pool, much more appropriate for adults than kids."
