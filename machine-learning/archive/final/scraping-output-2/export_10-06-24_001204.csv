Great view. Looking at the sea. Friendly. We were here at noon. Juice not fresh, but that‚Äôs all over Bali. Tasted good.","I Komang runs a great little beach restaurant that has a level of chill that I‚Äôve not yet experienced anywhere ever. His food is very tasty, copious and affordable. The views are absolutely epic, especially when the sun sits nice and low. It‚Äôs going to be a long drive back to this place from Ubud, but in my opinion absolutely worth it.",Great (safe) food. Great owner. Great location. Went there several times and the only thin I regret is that I can not be there more often. Hope to be there soon again. Love it!,"Delicious! Kindly owner, good music, nice view. 10/10
Regards from Poland",Good food and good service. The best in the area üëçüëç
