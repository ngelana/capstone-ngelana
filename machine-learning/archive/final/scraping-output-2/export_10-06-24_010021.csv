Food serving was huge and staffs are friendly. Affordable rates for day bed.","Love the ambience here. Beach club with sea view but kids friendly.
They have a great service, great food, great pool, and they have a foam pool party also. Our children loves to swim here.
Pepperoni pizza is recommended for sharing.
Orange juice is very refreshing. We ordered 3 glasses for this üòÑ.
Sabana sea breeze also great.
Whole coconut is also fresh and the water is sweet even without sugar.","Here for our daughter‚Äôs birthday yesterday. Staff was super attentive, food was amazing. Try their pepperoni pizza, chicken wing, nasi goreng and salad. All is great! Thank you to Bapak Dewa for his hospitality everytime we visit this place. It‚Äôs now become our kiddos‚Äô favorite ‚ù§Ô∏è","We got the Safari and Beach Club package and they took very good care of us from the start to the end. We were picked up from our hotel in Sanur and Mr Dewa was our driver. He was very friendly and kept checking on us, he made sure all of us well taken care of and provided the outmost service. We really enjoyed the garden cabana, food portions was big and delicious. Staff was attentive and provided great service too. The kids really enjoyed the pool, foam party and face painting. It was a very relaxing day for the family and we enjoyed it so much. Thumbs up to the flamingo team! I would highly recommend coming here. We feel so rejuvenated and happy. ü¶©‚õ±Ô∏èüòÄ‚ù§Ô∏è","I have been wanting to visit this place with a friend recommendation. I am not sure what to expect since some info about entrance fee, minimum spend etc. Came here today for a short visit 3 adults, 1 kid, so far so good ‚ô•Ô∏è

Music a bit loud on the entrance walk but was fine inside, Friendly staff welcomed us and lead us to day bed, we ordered food, price is reasonable & came out together so we have meals together so that's good. Pool is clean with a pool watcher so that's a plus! They have the changing booth & shower I think very well prepared so easy to change especially if with kids.

Plan to be back earlier and want to spend longer time there. Really like how this club is not overly crowded it makes it pleasant to hang out.

There's also playground in the space, definitely will be back."

The room, surrounded by nature, is comfortable, luxurious, and very well decorated in an authentic Balinese style. The owners, Carl & Alex are welcoming and available, they know the island very well and will help you get the best from your stay in Bali. The food at the cottage is delicious, freshly cooked with a menu changing everyday depending on Alex‚Äôs findings in local markets. Finally, the cottage is ideally located in the south east of Bali, where you will be able to explore, preferably by scooter, one of the most authentic and culturally rich region of the island.
I highly recommend.

This beautiful designed Bali open living, styled home, is the perfect, private and peaceful retreat for you and your family to just relax in for your holiday. (For little ones no fencing around the pool)
It's situated with an ocean view overlooking the popular Surfing ""Saba Beach"" with its unique black volcanic sand. The Commune Hotel is about a 20 minute walk up the Beach for a coffee or if you choose to dine out. Ubud is  30 minutes drive away with fantastic array of restaurants or you can just simply enjoy the beautiful sunsets around the gorgeous tantalizing Infinity 16 metre pool with your glass of wine while your  meal is cooked for you. Then dine in the open sided living room with its poolside dining!
The house is surrounded with landscaped gardens that are full of orchids and exotic plants to wander through.

The completely open living space is so fresh and peaceful with little birds all around and views of the ocean.
Saba beach is a popular surf beach with unique volcanic black sands.
We just spent 5 wonderful nights here and wish we could stay longer. We enjoyed an In house massage every morning, lunch out each day with so many options. Commune Hotel 15 mins walk up the beach, 5 mins car offers all day delicious food selection and great coffee. Sanur is 20 mins drive and many restaurants.. or just 30 mins drive to Ubud Village...
For dinner why go out when Komung will cook you a beautiful Indonesian meal at home in the Villa. (Komung was our lovely hostess who cares for all guests.)
Couldn‚Äôt get enough of the beautiful infinity pool, always seems a perfect temperature with  the sounds of ocean waves in the background, birds and view over the gardens.
The beds were really comfortable, rooms air conditioned and spotlessly clean.  Bring your own food delights (cheese and chocolates ) for snacking and some nice wine goes down very well at sunset.
This villa is perfect if you want to just sleep, relax, read, swim, yoga and spoil yourself...
With great internet you can still keep in touch with work or family.
