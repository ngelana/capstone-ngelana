Tasty food with reasonable price, they also have a swimming pool here and guest can swim (must pay but dw its really cheap)
The waitress is really nice and informative","A nice relaxing ambiance place for a meal. Unfortunately, my experience here wasn‚Äôt too pleasant. My order was taken after 20minutes of handing me the menu. Food only arrived after an hour plus‚Ä¶with the wrong item. I ordered the nila sambal locok but was served sambal matah. To further add to the frustration, I was only told that the side order of sayur urap has finished when they served my main meal. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Only got scraps of whatever‚Äôs leftover. They should have informed as soon as the kitchen informs that they are out of it and that would have allowed me a chance to make another order.

Please manage your expectations in waiting if you do chance upon my tough luck. They really should look into how to operate more efficiently. Maybe it could have been me being a foreigner in a local eatery‚Ä¶but I surely hope it is not due to that.",A traditional balinese culinary. Good taste and calming ambiance,Nice place with affordable price. Good service. Great place if you want to make an event,"The place is calm, clean enough, have parking area, the food is cheap and delicious, after eat we can enjoy the surrounding which still green.. surrounding by rice field."
