Regretfully, I had to cancel my booking at this property just 24 hours after making a reservation having discovered negative reviews regarding bedbugs at the property. Being elderly I could not face the prospect of exposing myself and compromising my travels. No one would take this risk when two independent travellers had reported issues just the week before.

The property assured me that they would offer a refund and I have spent the last two weeks liaising with them to secure a refund. Not only is there a hygiene matter of concern I am also feeling very let down by their service. Despite promising to arrange a refund, I still don’t have anything back from them. This is really disappointing service and I know that other people had similar concerns about their stays. Such a shame because I had a genuine cancellation reason and had only just booked so they did not miss out on any other bookings. Pretty appalling and they just kept referring back to the booking terms.",Its a beautiful location and facilities were amazing. This hotel has comfy beds with amazing and stunning views. Every morning we enjoyed free yoga and in the evening sauna was great followed by massages. The breakfast was great and staff were very polite and helpful. I recommend staying here if you want to have a chilled out time.,"Overall okay.
The best thing was the views, large bed and comfortable pillows.

However I am very lucky that my partner found that in our first bed, there were bed bugs. They moved us to a different room but gave no compensation for the additional laundry we would have to do.

However, the restaurant was meant to close at 9pm, but when we got back at 8, they had already closed it. When we left to get food the staff rushed back to reopen the kitchen and we waited around 45 mins for some mediocre, but fairly expensive food.

Then during the morning yoga (which was free, so I cant complain too much) there was a very loud high pitched drilling sound for much of it that was very off putting.

Pool was nice, the staff are polite.","I hate to leave a negative review but after the service we received here I was left completely dissatisfied.

Upon arriving at this hotel we wanted to get settled into our room and after a long day of traveling laid down to relax on our bed. However, I then realised that I had forgotten to check for bed bugs (as I always do at each place I stay). Unfortunately we discovered hundreds of bed bug eggs nestled in the corners of our mattress. I immediately addressed this with reception and they said sorry and moved us to another room. No compensation, no partial refund, no offer to pay for our laundry (which we then had to do because our belongings had come in contact with the bed and we didn’t want to risk passing bed bugs into our next accommodation) and no free meal or drinks as an apology. This just showed me that they had no idea how to provide good customer service and didn’t really seem bothered about our situation because they had moved us to a different room so in their eyes the problem was solved.

On a positive note, the pool and the view from the hotel were great and the new room appeared to be fairly clean with a very comfortable bed. However the service definitely let me down and the bed bugs soured the experience for me. The location is also very far away from any shops/restaurants so you need a bike to get anywhere.","Everything is perfect, The staff is so friendly, The owner who give Yoga lesson class on Saturday ( there are lessons class every day) is so friendly, The view is amazing, the room is very clean, the activities are good, Its very quiet, the price is very correct, I will come back;"
