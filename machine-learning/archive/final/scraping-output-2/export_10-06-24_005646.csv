The private pool room we stayed in exceeded our expectations with its luxurious size, cleanliness, and ample amenities. The villa itself was surrounded by beautiful greenery, creating a peaceful atmosphere that allowed for total relaxation.

We thoroughly enjoyed our two-night stay at Freddies and highly recommend it to others. As a precaution against mosquitoes, I advise keeping the room door closed  after evening hours.","I stayed at Vila Property for 3 days, and it was an absolutely wonderful experience! From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the stunning architecture and beautifully maintained grounds. The staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating, always ready to assist with a smile.

The rooms were spacious, clean, and well-equipped with modern amenities. The comfortable bed and serene ambiance made for a restful stay.

The location is isolated from ubud market and it’s very hard to find anything in walking distance .

Overall, Vila Property exceeded my expectations in every way. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing getaway. I can’t wait to return!","We’ve recently stayed here. Service is very poor and food was worst.
They take breakfast order on the previous day and it includes only one breakfast per person, you cannot order more. This was the worst part.
You can see lizards in the room. The place where it is located is also off.

If you are intending to book a hotel in ubud then please look for better options","Hi All, we stayed for 3 days in this hotel. The hotel room’s Seems to be ok, we had hard time on the day we arrived as the AC is not enough for us due to high humidity for such big room preferably need big AC or the AC condition might not be good. However hotel staff tried their level best to help us by calling the technician to visit how ever no much difference.
We have taken the pool villa for one day  that was excellent, the view and pool and the open bathroom seems to be very good and we enjoyed the pool villa so much. I suggest to take pool villa over here if you prefer to have stay over.","We recently stayed at this hotel and were thoroughly disappointed. The room was infested with mosquitoes, which made it impossible to sleep. The breakfast buffet was underwhelming, with stale options. But the worst part was the washroom. It was poorly maintained and loose faucets. We will not be returning to this hotel again.

If you are booking any holiday packages through travel websites, please make sure this hotel is not in your itinerary."

The restaurant is located within a resort and was totally empty when we arrived that we thought we were at the wrong place. However, we were really impressed by the food! Though the prices are definitely not cheap for local food, their food was really good. My mie goreng had breaded prawns as well which I have never seen it being included in a mie goreng before but they were really good and not greasy at all. While the Ayam Bakar Bucuan (spicy grilled chicken) which my husband had was a tad dry, the flavour was still good. Service was great too although we waited a while for the food. Overall, I will recommend this restaurant if you are in the area and looking for local food.","Good cosy place and serves good food with a good view. Its near a river bank. I loved the pork ribs, chicken breasts​ and Balinese food. They are great friendly people.","The food was good Indonesian food. Had the crispy duck. There were three beautiful Balinese dances.

Never had a problem with what was stated in previous reviews (trash etc.). It's tucked away in a serene corner. Definitely a hidden gem with a perfect blend of comfort, hospitality, and natural beauty.

The surroundings are lush and the gardens are well-maintained to give a peaceful atmosphere!","The accommodation itself is a haven of tranquility. The lush green surroundings and well-maintained gardens create a peaceful atmosphere, making it an ideal escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The architecture of Vila Letung is both charming and modern, providing a perfect balance between contemporary comfort and traditional aesthetics.","*Disclaimer: I originally posted this review on December 16th, 2022 while my girlfriend and I were staying in the villa, and the landlord of the property angrily harassed and bullied us into taking our reviews down. DO NOT COME HERE.*
The entire village burns their trash, including styrofoam, plastic, batteries, and every kind of garbage you can imagine. This leads to the villa to often be filled with toxic smoke, which has made me and my girlfriend very sick during our entire stay. We began developing painful acne, have had headaches since we first arrived, and have been sick to our stomachs to the point of throwing up frequently. We have ended up leaving three weeks earlier than our scheduled stay, and AirBnb offered to pay for our next place since the circumstances were so awful. This would be a lovely stay if you are in the villa for only minutes at a time, otherwise if you intend to spend a lot of time here; be prepared to become sick. We will not be coming back to this village, and I strongly advise you stay elsewhere until this issue is resolved.","Small, quiet and serene location. Staff were great hosts and attended to every request much quicker than expected. Would definitely choose another Bali stay with villa.","Beautiful private villa’s. Modern interior with a Balinese twist. This is the real Bali nature experience, in the midst of a local village and with beautiful scenery views. Absolutely perfect, you can relax and unwind here."
