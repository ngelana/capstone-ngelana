Pool, breakfast and rent a scooter all good.

But what I wanted to say is, we booked the ferry for 16:30 through the owners of this accommodation and at the same time we went to see some beaches in the morning.
Our ferry and a taxi were booked for the afternoon and the taxi was waiting at 15:30 .
We were returning from the beach around 13:00 and the heaviest rain I have seen in my life started. Of course we got stuck and couldn‚Äôt move but quite far from the accommodation.
We decided to leave as we had to catch the taxi and the ferry later on.
My bike stopped working (think water entered somewhere) and my friend went to the owners and told them what happened.
They sent taxi to collect us along with our luggage and we made it 10min before the ferry sailed. Not to mention we left the bike somewhere and taxi driver took the keys and returned them to the owner.
I can only send our gratitude and highly recommend these nice people to everyone.
I am sure in some other place they would take me responsible for the scooter and would miss the ferry and the plane later on.

Thank you and thank you again, you left positive experience for us and we wish you all the best.","staying at Kubu Sental Cottages was a beautiful experience, the staff were so friendly and welcoming- they were willing to help us with anything we needed such as taxi and scooter rental, making us breakfast and recommending destinations to see on the island. the rooms and pool were stunning, and all at a very reasonable price! a very big thank you for having us and would definitely recommend to anyone travelling ‚ò∫Ô∏è",Rooms are good. The wood and bathroom can use some maintenance but everything else is fine for the price we paid. Very quiet place away from the mainroad. Very friendly staff. We had some miscommunication with the taxi. But I suggest to rent a motorbike at the harbor and use that to get there and back.,This hotel is far away from the main road. It is atleast 2 kms away from the main road and 8 kms away from the toya pakeh harbour. From Main road to hotel there is no street light so at night there is a issue for going out for dinner. I wont recommend you stay at this property if your coming with the family. The system of washroom is also very odd as the washroom is in the ground floor and room is upstairs. if you want to go to toilet in the night you have to get down. if you wanna bath you have to get down as it makes little uncomfortable to change clothes. Food is good and the staff too. Swimming pool is the only best part of this hotel. the room was cheap i got it in Rs.3500/- (INR) for 2 nights.,"It was no problem to extend our stay, because the boats weren‚Äôt going. And the staff also called a few times to see if the boats would leave the island. The people that work here are very nice and helpful. Also the rooms are really nice. Would recommend to stay here!"

All the staff, including the driver and our tour guide, did their best to make our stay an unforgettable experience for the two days my parents and I stayed there.

Especially the manager of this hotel, who was patient and friendly and spoke Chinese! She made my non-English speaking parents feel incredibly welcome. We also cooked chicken noodle soup together on our last night and had a very enjoyable night with them .

Also, i have to mention that before we got to the island, the hotel staff provided us with a detailed guide to buying boat tickets and told us a reasonable price range for transportation . Since we don't know how to ride a motorbike, the staff picked up all of our dinners here for us, which were affordable and delicious.

The  tour guide we went with did his best to take countless wonderful photos of us, despite not being proficient in English. Took us to treasure shooting spots he found himself. When we were climbing the mountain, he helped us carry our water bottles and luggage, which was really touching.

I really recommend Gading Tree House to everyone.‚ô•Ô∏è","The outside area area incl the pool is just as beautiful as in the pictures.

Staff is nice, but sometimes their English is just not good enough to communicate effectively with hotel guests.

The hotel is beautifully located close to nature, but that means in return you will need a motorbike or private driver to take you anywhere. It's at least a 25-30 min walk along a (partially) very steep road to get to any restaurants or shops. The hotel offers the opportunity to order food from one of the restaurants, which is nice. However, in my case they did not mention the delivery fee. The money was not a big deal, but still an unpleasant surprise.

The walls of the room are also very thin so you hear everything from outside: wild life, people talking or walking in front or above your room etc...

Overall I enjoyed my stay and would recommend Gading Treehouse, but there were just these few points that did not make it a 5* experience for me.","Had a great stay in Gading Treehouse! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I slept in the treehouse which was great, felt like sleeping in nature with the sounds of the gecko‚Äôs and other animals üòç Loved the openness of the house, so nice!

Apart from the accommodation, I loved the local people in the street, while walking by all the kids started waving already and shouting your name ‚ù§Ô∏è Had some nice chats with the locals there!

The staff of Gading was outstanding! Always friendly, up for a chat or giving me a ride to the diving centre üòÉ

Suksima & Sampai jumpa!

Wish you all the best!","Everything good. Services when I'm arrived with welcome drink. Staff very good, friendly. But it's will be much better if provide portable aircond.Nowaday weather too hot even location surrounding greeny. Ceiling fan too slow even put level 5.Hope can improve for future.","Perfect gateway place . We stayed there for Christmas and couldn't have asked for a better place. Super dedicated staff. We felt cared for and quite alone in the jungle which was nice.
Room was stylish and comfortable. Highly recommend"
