I spent 10 days with them, solo traveling woman, felt completely safe and cared for, like being a part of the family. The yoga classes are of a high quality, including different styles. They prepared their food freshly and adapted to my needs.
These 10 days were an absolute immersion into balinese culture and living as they made trips with us to the heart of their region, wonderful and kind people.","I had a week long yoga and meditation package with accomodations and all meals plus many wonderful excursions and activities. It was all wonderful. The amazing part was working through a difficult first couple of days to come out healthier in body, mind and spirit than I have felt in along time. I also loved the staff and food.","We have just spent a week here, the staff are absolutely wonderful (all run by a lovely happy family), so friendly and caring. The whole place is very clean, they do housekeeping daily, and we had fresh bedding and sheets every 2 days. Such a wonderful relaxing environment, and the pool is spotless - we swam every day!
They have activities running all of the time, if you don‚Äôt book a specific retreat package you can still book on to these. Some are run with a neighbouring accommodation, including twice daily yoga sessions which we highly recommend too!
It‚Äôs in a small village, however the staff also offer transport if needed and they also offer 3 meals per day (all extra but totally worth it). Food is lovely - fresh fruit every day!
We would definitely stay again and recommend to our friends!
Thank you again for looking after us!","I loved my stay at the Bali Garden Retreat. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. The staff were, at all times, very friendly and helpful. They always had a smile on their faces and were quick to attend to any needs or questions that I had.

I thoroughly enjoyed the yoga sessions. There are 2 a day (8 am & 4 pm) and they are headed by a range of different teachers with their own unique styles so that allowed for much variety and kept it interesting. They also made sure to modify with suggestions about how to carry out different poses according to your level.

I also had a great deal of fun with the daily cultural activities, which usually started at about 11, from visiting the shaman, to making canang, trekking, visiting the local village to see how coconut oil was made and more!

The food was another highlight for me. It was always well-balanced and simply delicious. I always looked forward to the meals, especially after the yoga sessions!

While there is a lot to do, you still have time to yourself to unwind and dip in the pool, or rest in your room as well.

I can't recommend this retreat enough. It is the best that I have been on and I wished I could've stayed longer. It was the perfect place to feel at peace and rejuvenated.","Did a 6days yoga retreat here. Nyoman and the rest of the team are really welcoming and caring. The place is peaceful but you need to get used to the barking dogs and roosters at night. The food was amazing, and the surrounding area is spectacular with lots of rice fields and waterfalls. The beach yoga was also a great way to enjoy a tranquil and not touristy black beach.
Thank you so much for having me! üôè"

I loved here while I visited the nearby retreat center (Balitrees - 5 minute walk). The family is kind and friendly and takes very good care of you. The rooms have a private bathroom with a hot shower and good electricity. The best part is the people who live here and the beautiful gardens that they keep!!!
