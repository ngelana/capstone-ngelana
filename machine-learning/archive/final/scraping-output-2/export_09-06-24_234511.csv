The grilled chicken was especially tasty. Take a stroll after the meal and enjoy the swing and wonderful landscape the place offers!,It was the best food that we had in Bali. What a special experience!!! The owners is extremely welcoming and friendly. This was an experience on its own great food and good company. The fried rice and chicken dish is very very good. Strongly recommend the red rice tea. I just love this special place. Everyone needs to visit here!!!,Beautifull views and delicious nasi and mie goreng! Such a nice,"The best food we had in Bali. The owner and his wife are amazing, we felt at home and we had an insight of the Bali culture. They speak amazing English so you can have a chat to find out more about their life and their culture.
100% worth the detour, for the food, the atmosphere and the view. Youâ€™re in the middle of rice fields overlooking three mountains.
If we ever come back to Bali, visiting will be a must!","100% recommended!
We came at 7pm and Arta and his wife were already about to leave due to no guests. They were so kind to reopen the restaurant for us and made us one of the most delicious dinners we had in Bali so far. I could order any meal from the menu and they would make a vegetarian variation for me, which I really appreciated.
Also in general they both were super nice and friendly and Arta even spoke German with us, which was pretty surprising!"

We will be back and tell all our friends about it. Kia Ora from New Zealand my friend.,"The surroundings is so much better than the pictures. The host Arta is very helpful and easy to communicate with, the room is also equipped with everything you need. There is no air conditioning but itâ€™s not needed as the area is refreshly cold, also walking distance to a nice waterfall and a restaurant next door.","Great place, beautiful view of the rice fields, at night you can hear cicadas and see fireflies, 10 minutes from the accommodation there is a waterfall where nobody comes (almost like a private waterfall), 12 minutes into town there are local hot springs under the bridge. Very nice hosts!",Had such a special time here. Arta is an absolute legend and very accommodating. There is so much surrounding beauty in these parts. Definitely do some waterfalls and bird watching here. Jutiluwih is great too ðŸŒ¾,"I really enjoyed the serenity of the atmosphere around the cabin with my partner.. we really enjoyed the natural beauty around the cabin area.. starting from waterfalls, rice fields, very friendly locals... and amazing evenings...
i am very very happy to find a place like this cabin... thank you and  if I could give more than 5 Stars I will give them 100 stars lovely"

Recommend to have coconut inside rice terrace.","My visit was back in
2019 October. Been had lunch here 3 days in row !! The food was amazing, the owner was generous and kind. She gave us, desert, entre, and cacao fruit for our way back as complimentary. My partner wanted to try eel, and they prepared for us the next day. And he loved it!!
I totally recommended if you visit jatiluwih. Located not far from Pura Besi Kalung, but if you are from entrance of rice fields, you need to walk until almost the end of the rice fields.
The view was calming, quiet, and you can enjoy it for yourself.",Beautiful place in the middle of the rice fields. Lovely local people. Cheap prices. Get some rest of the long walk. Delicious food.,"They are really nice but I am sorry, I donâ€™t like how they do the business.
We didnâ€™t ask chips but they give us with the juice, we thought it was complimentary but they charge it 20k in the bill.
We ordered curry but it was not a curry that they served, its more like stir fried vegetables with soup, and they charge 70k for every plate.
Fried rice came with only rice and a small amount of eggs as a topping. No veggies or even chicken. They charge 45k for every plates.
For a small warung and the food that you get, the price is expensive and tasteless.

The good thing is only the view.","the food is delicious, the service is very good and friendly, the food prices are also very affordable. The place is beautiful, surrounded by views of green rice fields."

Right after crossing treshold of this restaurat we were welcomed as family, food was absolutly amazing, we ate here one of the best dinner in Bali. I can't say any bad word! Totally worth to taking 2 minutes of trial for such wonderful expiriences in the middle od ricefields.","I highly recommend this place. Food was excellent, we ate here one of the best Nasi Goreng. Stuff was amazing too, very friendly and helpfull. The place is located far from crowded main road where most restaurants are placed (and they are much expensive) and in the middle of the rice fields, so you will have calm meal here.","I accidentally stumbled upon Warung Mina Nugraha while trekking alone. I met the most friendly people, had some great fish and stayed for a few cup of teas. Lovely people!",Very nice place
