And the food, yuuummmm. Pair your coffee with any toasted bread they have would be amazing and bring your coffee experience to infinity and beyond haha.

Note this internet, always ask for mosquito repellent lotion :)","Very cozy, nice guy, tasty food

We got a bottle of arak cocktails and a chicken dish and fish dish with rice, 2 portions of ice cream and it was 150000 which is around ‚Ç¨10. I gave a tip also as it was one of the nicest nights we had. My trial bill including tip was ‚Ç¨13. Please go here and support local businesses and at this price you can't complain.","Since living in Mambal, Warung Penyemeng has become my daily kitchen, and for good reason! The food is delicious; my personal favorites are the Capcay (chicken, egg, and vegetable soup), Jamur Crispy (crispy mushrooms), Rice Bowl Ayam (crispy chicken bites & rice), and Mie Goreng (stir fried noodles). The staff is very friendly and they will really make sure to give you the best service. (When having my food delivered, I asked if they could pack it in a natural container instead of styrofoam and they really made my night with this awesome woven grass boxüôåüèº). Prices are also very affordable. I highly recommend this Warung!","Hostess is really kind. Great food.
