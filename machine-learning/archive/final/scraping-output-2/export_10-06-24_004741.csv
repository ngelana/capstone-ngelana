Mengwi, Kabupaten Badung, Bali 80351, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=12620827724593023725,OPERATIONAL,,hindu_temple,"hindu_temple, tourist_attraction, place_of_worship",4.6,8283,,"Beautiful, sacred temple surrounded by lovely garden, temples, galleries and mini theatre.

Located at Mengwi, it took me around 1.5 to go here for Nusa Dua. It was on weekend with quite heavy traffic.

The temple is wonderful and unique as it was built surrounded by water.

The entrance ticket is Rp15.000,- for domestic tourists. You buy it at the entrance. They check your ticket and your attire at the entrance, making sure we respect the sanctity of the temple. They will lend you a piece of sarong to cover up.

The galleries are packed with photos, histories and painting. The mini theatre shows movie about the history of this place.

There are ramps in many parts of the temple and the garden so it's quite ‚ôøÔ∏è friendly. There are stairs as well and I think it will be a bit tricky with such combination. But they have a dedicated path for those with wheelchairs so it's great and helphul. The toilets are also provided, with one for disabled, although I suggest that the designated toilet for persons with disabilites is built wider and more spacious.

I came at around 5PM so it wasn't packed with tourists.

There's a cafe inside if you need to get some food and beverages.

Parking spot can be found on the surrounding areas","We recently visited Taman Ayun Temple as part of a day trip from Ubud booked through a travel company called Ubud Area Tours. The temple is inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Opening hours are 8am to 6.15pm daily and entry fee is IDR15K per person which includes a sarong which you must wear while exploring the temple grounds.

Historically this is the Royal temple of the Mengwi while the complex that you see today seems to date back to the early 17th-century and features traditional Balinese Hindu temple architecture.

The temple grounds are surrounded by a manmade rectangular shaped pond (moat) and connected by way of a bridge. You will see delicately carved entryways, shrines and other structures symmetrically situated amidst  gardens and green grounds. There is a Rice goddess statue along with side gallery with art and film describing some of the history of the temple and Mengwi people.

Overall, this was a very impressive temple complex to visit during our day trip out of Ubud. It was particularly helpful having a driver/guide familiar with the temple history and able to share with us what we were seeing. We very much enjoyed our visit and would gladly return to see Taman Ayun Temple again during future visits to Bali.","pretty beautiful and calming temple. The ground is big, surrounded by water. It has calming and relaxing vibes just walking around. Less people so it is very nice and not crowded so you can enjoy the temple and relax. The entrace fee is 15k for domestic and 30k for international. Recommend this place to be visited.","Interesting place. During the ride with the taxi driver, they stop here. Well, taxi drivers stop in every temple where you need to pay, which theres no problem, prices are so cheap. But it is sad that they see you as a tourist, they think you don't know anything and they want to take advantage.","A must visit temple ! You will love it.
I loved how well kept and managed it was.
They gave us a little brochure about the temple and the tour ended with an art gallery and museum.
We ended up arriving around closing time but the employee was very friendly and patient with us."

They have a collection of over 20 ogoh-ogoh on display, including a massive one you can take a photo with. The ogoh-ogoh are incredibly detailed, standing tall at 3-5 meters and portraying God or fierce creatures. The owner is very knowledgeable and provides interesting insights about the ogoh-ogoh tradition.

This museum is a fantastic resource to learn about and experience Balinese culture. The entrance fee is 20k IDR per person (as of March 2024). Please keep in mind since most ogoh-ogoh are crafted from styrofoam and paper, they are quite fragile. It's always a good idea to ask the owner before touching it.

Outside the museum, there are hawker stalls selling variety of local food and beverages, so you can grab a bite to eat after your visit. Overall, I highly recommend visiting this place! I was so happy to see and take photos with Shiva, Barong, Rangda, and other cool ogoh-ogoh.","This is a fun little gem of a museum! On an island full of overpriced tourist traps, this place is the real deal. It is small, but full of incredible works that look incredible in real life. The woman who runs it also gives you a lot of great information about the history and celwbration of Balinese New Year.","Cost Rp 10,000 for adults and Rp 5,000 for children to visit. Completely worth it!!! The owner informed me that for Bali New Year, people make these giant monsters, and whatever ones don't get burned he buys it to add to his collection. Pictures don't capture how giant and cool these are!!! If you like monsters, highly recommend checking this place out!","The sculptures are magnificent and they are the real sculptures used in the festivals over many years.  The purification of the evil spirts is no longer performed by fire, leaving these stunning works of art intact for all to view.  This should not be missed on your tour through the area.  It‚Äôs a true insight into traditional Bali culture.","Amazing collection of Ogoh Ogoh parade statues. The manager/owner was very kind and showed us around. Explained stories of some of the statues, how they were made, and took photos of us (even dressed up)! A hidden gem!"
