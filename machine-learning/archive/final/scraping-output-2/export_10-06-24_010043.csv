It's close to a number of warungs and a few food carts are often found along the main road so it's quite easy to buy takeout foods like Chinese, gule, satay, etc. There's also a new jogging track at the back of the complex which goes all the way near Dalung Permai; we often walk along there in the morning while enjoying the rice fields. Complex is relatively safe all the time despite security guards don't always shows up. And it's quiet as well since it is a bit isolated from the main road.

Now for the minus things. First, it lacks of power outlets and the quality of the building's materials are kinda cheap. Second, mobile network isn't very good in here, probably because the complex is built on a hill slope (we use Indosat, not sure about the quality of other providers in here).",It's a good place to stay here because the house is so clean and tidy with a minimalist interior. The housekeeper is so helpful. But the access to the villa is a bit dark.,"Quite place.
Have a running route just beside of the river.

It has a very pleasing ambiance here, it's beside the fields, they have a mini pool table too and you‚Äôd get it free to play.
They got many menus that are affordable too and WiFi, so you can work on your laptop here or just chill on the couch.
I think there‚Äôs one thing that needs to improve a little bit: the toilet‚Äôs clean.
Ada sedikit lil gift (ide design area toilet) dari sy karena saya suka cafe ini (sudah 4-5x visit) dan merekomendasikannya ke teman. Barangkali menjadi inspoüòÉ.","It's a good place. The food is delicious and inexpensive. A lot of chicken was put in the dish. They did not spare the meat, as in many cafes. Thanks.","The atmosphere of this place is so conducive to a pleasant pastime that you can forget about the hustle and bustle of city life.

But the most important thing, of course, is the coffee and food. I ordered an Americano and I had to agree that it was a delightful Americano! It was hot and fragrant, with the perfect ratio of coffee to water. I felt that this drink was truly made with love and professionalism.

And the pasta was a real masterpiece! I ordered pasta with mushrooms and spinach, and it was excellent. The sauce was rich, and the mushrooms were cooked in a way that they melted in your mouth. The taste of this pasta was so good that I could eat it every day.

Of course, the dish took a little while to come out, but it was not critical since I came here not to eat quickly and leave. I wanted to enjoy the cuisine of this place and the pleasant atmosphere, and that's what I got.

Another plus of this restaurant is the prices. The prices for the dishes are very reasonable, which is really pleasing. I can recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to spend time in a pleasant environment, enjoy delicious food and excellent coffee. If you haven't been here yet, then you definitely should come here.","Carbonara was delicious, Jasuke also good. I prefer the music more pop . Pandan latte and Hazelnut Yakult was good.  Thank you.","The food is super cheap, and taste just okay. Service incredibly is helpful. But the atmosphere‚Ä¶.ü•¥ Its just super hot, perhaps it‚Äôs the glass.

The burgers are standard, more like ""Indonesian Burgers"" with sweet buns, just a piece of lettuce and a slice of tomato, and packaged chili sauce.  I chose the cheese variant, it was quite good, the cheese melted well.  I suggest buying this if you want ""Indonesian Burger"".
