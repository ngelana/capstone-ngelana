The rooms are very basic and do not expect any luxury . Cats live in the ceiling . There are not ATM and it‚Äôs cash only , and you can‚Äôt pay via any of the online platforms.

The service was ok but we had an issue with one of the attendants in squaring away our food bill and also the fact that we were told breakfast was included but then all of a sudden it was not.

In any case , this is a cheap place to stay with zero thrills and you get what you pay for","Beautiful local hotel and just enough facilities for backpack travellers like me. The view every morning and evening is so beautiful.

Don't forget to mention the restaurant that serve balinese food that so delicious for me. Will be back soon when I visit Kintamani in the future..",Nice hotel close to Mt Batur for the early morning climb start. Clean but basic rooms.
