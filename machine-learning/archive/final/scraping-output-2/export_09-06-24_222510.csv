Catherine and her team made it one of the most comfortable and luxurious stays we‚Äôve ever had. From the smell of the freshly washed towels and linen (which made us get our own laundry done!) to the food, surroundings and flexibility of booking in activities, we would give it 5 stars!
It is very secluded and feels like a retreat so be prepared to feel cut off from the world and lose yourself to the sound of the waves and wildlife. It felt as though the owner had designed her business to include everything she would want from a luxury stay and eliminate everything she hates about time restrictions and rules and regs of hotels (so for instance breakfast was served until you wanted it!)
Thank you Catherine we will definitely be back again, you made us feel like we were visiting family but without the expectations and intrusion.","The pictures don't do the place justice. It is even more beautiful in person.
It is quite, unbelievably pretty, you can see this place has been lovingly decorated with a lot of attention to detail.
The food is excellent, we had dinner and breakfast and both was prepared perfectly.
There is also a dart board, games and a pool table.. if we just would've had more time.
Will definitely return.","Yes, yes, yes!!! If I could give 10 stars I would.

This beautiful, hidden-away resort is the ultimate Bali escape! Catherine (the French owner) and her staff are absolutely amazing and will go above and beyond to provide you with a relaxing stay.

The rooms are tastefully decorated, following a lovely theme that suits the beach location. The pool areas, restaurant and spa are like an oasis ‚Äì truly a hidden gem I would absolutely recommend.

Having stayed at fancy 5-star resorts in Uluwatu, staying at Louka was refreshing (and not pretentious) for an affordable price.

We will be back 100%!! üôè",A perfect place if you want to be away from the crowd. Very peaceful. The owner was very helpful and welcoming. The staff very very good.  I suggest you to book directly from them. The food it was fantastic. A little far from the airport but worth it. I highly recommend it. Thank you Catherine for made my stay so pleasant. Cheers !,Louka Resort is the most beautiful place I‚Äôve ever seen. The rooms are amazing and spacious with patios and there are two different pools on the grounds. We ate most of our meals there and they were all delicious. We got wonderful messages in a beautiful seaside room so close you heard ocean waves the entire time. The best part is the hospitality - every staff member is so kind and accommodating and the owner was so friendly and helpful. I cannot recommend this place enough!

I had my parents visiting from Canada as I live in Uluwatu and it was a nice change from the southern part of Bali. The resort its self is beautiful with serene views of the ocean and the staff are so kind and helpful. I would highly recommend staying here for anyone who is looking for a nice, relaxing, comfortable stay. It would also be beautiful for a wedding or family gathering! We will be back!","Awesome place for a holiday. The staff is friendly. The resort is well maintained. Recommended for honeymoon, family gathering, or just relaxing üòé",Amazing resort and great view. Super calming!!,,

Kubu, Kabupaten Karangasem, Bali 80853, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=5199179103919182969,OPERATIONAL,+62 811-2211-194,bed_and_breakfast,"bed_and_breakfast, lodging",4.7,22,,"This is a very nice place with a lovely pool, open gardens and direct beach access. The beach is black sand and pebbles and there's a narrow but good stretch of reef only a few metres out, perfect for a morning snorkel. The sunrises are wonderful with views of Gunung Rinjani on Lombok in the distance. It is a B&B and, though you may be the only guests there (there are two spacious rooms available), the hosts are generous with plenty of local advice. The food is as good as you find in most places and you have a kitchen to cook your own if you choose, or go to the warung almost over the road. I've just read a previous guest's recent review and this seems to be a huge over-reaction. For us the food was very nice. The bathroom did not fill up with bugs and nor did the bedroom! I think we had to chase away a single mosquito and this was at the end of the wet season. There are two dogs on the property (golden retrievers). We did not see any hair in the pool and nor were there mouldy toys or any other such things! Our daughter was a bit worried about the dogs but the hosts went out of their way to keep them indoors or in their separate little garden area at the back of the property. In the three days we were there they did not interfere in any way. There are some belongings of the hosts there - fins, masks, snorkels etc that are available to use - but that's it.The hosts know a couple of local masseuses who will come to the property. My wife and I had massages and one of the ladies gave a short massage to each of our children too so they didn't feel left out and could experience it for themselves. If you go there expecting a private villa with no one else about, you may find it it is not quite what you want. But it is advertised as a B&B and, in my experience, this means that you are in the home of the host, who runs the property and provides breakfast. The hosts here did exactly that and more. Good luck finding a nicer place at such a reasonable price!","We booked both bungalows with the idea that you have the swimming pool to yourself and privacy, but none of this is true.

You are sitting in the middle of the owners belongings (swimming shorts, shoes and other many many knick knacks).

The food is average and cold when it arrived. The breakfast is just absolutely terrible. Don‚Äôt ask for an extra piece of toast as you will have to pay for this. Never had to negotiate for breakfast in my life.

There are 2 or 3 big dogs on the property. Apparently 1 dog likes to swim and swims in the pool. In my opinion this is just absolutely disgusting and is unhygienic. The pool was full of hair and toys that grow mold.

Edit: this isn‚Äôt an open bathroom situation (like the owner is stating). This is an old bathroom with a window you can‚Äôt even reach or look out too. The room filled up with bugs in the night. Even we kept all doors closed. They come in from the bathroom window (no mosquito screen or glass screen available). When we mentioned this to the staff they just shrugged their shoulders.

The room is dark, the bathroom is old, doors don‚Äôt even close properly and a used sponge was hanging in the shower. The cleanliness was very questionable.

We booked a 7 night stay and decided to leave after 1. This was a big mistake and I don‚Äôt understand where the 5 star reviews are coming from.","A wonderful ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù.  The villa is right on a pebbly beach, and you see corals a just after a few strokes - perfect place for snorkelling.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable with a porch for alfresco dining and relaxation.  The lush garden and good-sized pool are tranquil and filled with frangipani scent.  Message in the garden by the beach is a must!  The hosts and staff are absolutely lovely, very accommodating and helpful.  A great escape from the touristy side of Bali.","A perfectly relaxing place in a lush tropical garden directly on a quiet beach.
The host gave us a warm welcome. We had dinner together and spent a wonderful evening in their open living space.
The guest rooms are luxuriously furnished and provide privacy in a separate garden house.
We could only stay for one day but would have loved to stay longer. Very recommended!","I had the pleasure of being the guest of this beautiful spot in the north of Bali. It's an oasis of quietness surrounded by a lovely garden with a nice pool.
Brett is a perfect host who knows the area well and will assist you in getting in touch with dive schools, tour guides, etc.
You will immediately feel at home and enjoy your time there."
