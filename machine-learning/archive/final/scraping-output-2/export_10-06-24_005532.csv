The staff is amasing. We can't give them enough credit for their way of treating us. Very friendly and forthcoming; doing their best to make us feel good.
Our room, Ganesha, #104, was great. We especially, loved the showerfacility. The room was nice and clean, the bed made us sleep like babies. And the ac worked perfect. Being located to a room just beside the great pool, was just another plus. üëç
The hotel garden is really a place where you can lean back and relax.
We had breakfast and dinner at the restaurant twice. And we can only recommend it. Great food, allthough you must think twice before you order breakfast. A ""fried egg"" is not just a fried egg. It's a meal. üòãüëç.  We recommend you try the Kung Pao Chicken and the Falafel Bowl. If you do want the burger, remember your toothbrush. The charcoal bun is great, but it is rrrrrreally black. üòâ
We recommend Vision Villa to everyone. Singles, couples and families with kids.
A special thank to Triana, Kane and Yuanita who made our stay so so good.","We are just amazed. Everything here is just awesome.

Amazing staff which solves your every request with a smile, helps you and advise you with usefull tips on what to do in the neighbourhood, super delicious food. Oh sorry, that is not correct, the food is more than that! I liked everyrhing here. Since I am an vegetarian, this was a paradise for me. And those home mada brownies and chocolate! Unbelievable!

The views in the garden are so calming, the peace and traquility. Nothing less.

And lady in a spa is just perfect. Massages were so calming and she helped me with my back pains.

And staff were more than nice to our daughters.
