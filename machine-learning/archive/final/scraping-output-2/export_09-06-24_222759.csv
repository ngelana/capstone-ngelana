Guntur and his mother were really helpful to teach us how to weave a beautiful basket and after the workshop we could buy some more homemade products. They told us about the process before the weaving but also their way of living in the village and it was very interesting to learn about it! I would definitely recommend.,A fantastic experience! I can highly recommend a visit to this place. Get to know all about bamboo weaving in the most beautiful surroundings among the friendly and welcoming families of Tigawasa. A unique place that I will surely visit again soon.,Good place for bamboo weaving class,Feel Home,Bamboo movement and culture
