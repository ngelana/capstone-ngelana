Experience: 5/5

I've tried both ancient sound healing and LSV (light, sound, vibration).
LSV was much better as it was for fewer people reducing the risk of doing the session with people who cough, use their phones or snore. Despite promises, the staff doesn't always react which ruined my experience during ancient sound healing.

Drums, gongs, Didgeridoo, and other instruments used during the sessions produce vibrations that reduce beta and increase tetha waves, which leads to deep relaxation.

Top tips:
1. Check out shuttle bas options from Ubud Palace.
2. Book your spot online.","An incredible spot for meditation; I could spend an entire day here, immersing myself in various experiences. It holds a remarkable power, so be prepared. The pleasant cafe offers a variety of juices and some food options. After leaving this place I felt like a new person.","Experienced the Ancient Sound Healing meditation class. Was given a complimentary eye pillow for the session to bring home.

It was an extremely lovely experience with such a beautiful ambience, I felt so peaceful and relaxed here. The instructor was very well knowledgeable about the types of gongs and other instruments that was used in the class.

The session definitely put me in a deep state of relaxation and calm. It was certainly more intense and intimate as compared to any other meditation experiences I‚Äôve had.

I will definitely come back and visit again.","Hello friends üòÅüòÅüòÅ Far from the center and there were big traffic jams, it took 1.40 by car.

Loose screwed hanging table. Door can't fully opened. Broken ceiling at bathroom. Stained bed sheet.

Location (1/5):
Remotely located which is quiet but narrow access and horrible parking space. Absolutely not suitable if coming with car.

Service (1/5):
The worst of all. They clean the room but don't put new towel and mat so I have to come down myself to ask for it but both reeked of metal or something.

Verdict:
I truly regret staying at this hotel, not even a slightly enjoyable experience. First of all, the horrible parking space with poor access. I don't mind entrust my key at the front desk, but I have to wait 20 minutes myself just to get out because of the full space. And on my last day I have to face an impudent female staff but don't give a damn care anymore. Truth be told it's 3 star hotel with 1 star quality.

I advise to stay away if you come with car or on family vacation. This hotel actually has potential but with this poor management and everything I'm afraid it won't last.","Room is clean and spacey.

Sadly there are a few works going on next door (like most places in Ubud- just something to be mindful of). I think this  the noise and sights could be covered one day with some natural fencing or trees to make the overall feel by the pool much nicer.
The location I love, it‚Äôs a bit further out of Ubud centre but if you have time to walk around, the jungle sights are lovely and different from what you find in Ubud Center. There are some great cafes around, I highly recommend Melali and Muse.

Although it's not in the best location in Ubud, it's easily accessible with a motorbike within 8 minutes, and they even provide a shuttle service going 3 times back and forth to and from the city center to Ubud palace.

Also, just in front of the hotel, there are 2 great restaurants with amazing prices! They called 'Mula Ubud' & 'Mai Ubud'.

The breakfast was always super delicious. You have a choice between either a fruit shake or sliced fruit and on top of that American, Continental, or Indonesian breakfast. The American one was basically 2 eggs served in different ways. The continental breakfast was pancakes and I absolutely loved them! Definitely give them a try!

The rooms are spacious as described on the booking platforms and the condition of the hotel is also absolutely fine. It really provides western standards and we highly appreciated the daily cleaning services which ended up in great cleanliness!

Overall, staying at Gita Maha was the perfect accommodation in Ubud and we totally recommend staying here!

Thank you so much again, guys, that was just perfect!","The rooms I was shown were old and musty. Smelled like mildew. I am sensitive to mold. Cancelled my booking.

I can't recommend this property. The listing photos look great but the actual rooms were very disappointing. This is my first trip to Bali I became instantly deflated after this being it was my first day to Ubud.

The managing staff person was super friendly and understanding. He was in agreement in assisting me with cancelling the booking.

I hope the owner/management addresses the conditions mentioned. Considering Ubud is a place of wellness, having mildew and musty conditions are so contradictory.

Breakfast is great

The hotel and rooms are big and tastefully done. Gorgeous views of rice fields and in a still quiet area of Ubud - away from traffic . Siwi and her staff are so incredible and lovely. We love to stay with them like family. Choose this hotel if you want a peaceful and real Ubud experience. Best service ever !,"Stayed here for 6 nights and had an absolute wonderful stay. The staff are all so loving and caring. They really treat you like family and want you to enjoy Bali to the fullest. They offer free shuttle service to central ubud and back to the hotel which was a huge convenience! Great free breakfast options, comfortable room with mosquito nets (even though we had zero bugs at all), and a PS3 in our room with many games and movies on blue ray to use from the hotel. Overall; amazing stay and couldn‚Äôt be more thankful to the staff for making it a wonderful stay.","We stayed at the studio, which was very spacious and clean with a balcony and beautiful view of rice fields. Staff is friendly and breakfast is delicious. There. The walk to Ubud is a bit lengthy, but there is a convenient shuttle between the hotel and central Ubud plus you can order a rideshare using Grab or Gojek app. Very quiet stay away from busy and noisy Ubud areas.

The only con was a slow WiFi, but we didn‚Äôt really need it for our stay.","Great check in with delicious welcome drink provided.  Upon arrival in our room, we noticed a wonderful handwritten note welcoming us to the hotel.  Wow what a kind gesture!  Also enjoyed the PS3 game system with blue ray disc player.  Pool is small but clean.  We booked a Kintamani tour through the hotel and it was awesome.  Major shout out to our driver Dewa! üôè Free shuttle from hotel to downtown Ubud is available from 10:00am to 10: you 00pm.  Easy to schedule your return pickup via WhatsApp.  Special thanks to Sre, Siwi and Ngurah for their incredibly kind service!","We recently visited Bali and stayed in JunJungan for 4 nights. The whole experience was amazing. We also enjoyed the Spa. Food was awesome and they catered to our dietary needs.

Siwi, Sri and other staffs were nothing but smiling, humble and helpful individuals.

Thanks all for making our stay more pleasant.

It‚Äôs nice to get out of Ibud center and have a nice meal in what‚Äôs left of the rice fields near town. The first lunch I had was the ribs, which I ate before even thinking of taking a photo, they were so good. The next time I stopped in I had the chicken curry with brown rice.

Great little pool area very calming,

Cons- a little bit out of ubud centre but still very accessible by Gojek/grab/taxi, not much food places in walkable distance

There is a tv + safebox  + wardrobe but no mini bar , No tissu on the table, only toilet paper + they only give us one brush for 2 guests..when i ask that the staff said Yeah there's only one in the room.

The staff were amazing as well!,"The room is very large and gorgeous. The staff are very attentive, lovely people. Great price, yummy breakfast, and the location is a lovely break from the busyness of Ubud.  There are quite a few restaurants in walking distance. It would easily be about an hr walk, but a quick Grab or scooter (the front desk can set you up for 100,000 rdp a day).

The only downside is that our room faced construction and powerlines.",This Villa was a perfect spot to retreat to during our time in Ubud. It's a short scooter ride down the road to the centre of town. The service was warm and accommodating. Would not hesitate to book here again!,"We booked based on the reviews and the photos. The drive out was very far from the main centre- definitely not the 15 minute walk they mention at booking.com- more like 1 h. The driveway and general area looks not well maintained. We almost felt like they were surprised that we arrived.

Once we were taken to the villa, we noticed that boards around the pool were lose and it wasn‚Äôt quite what the photos promised.

The icing on the cake was that we booked a private villa and noticed that there was a cctv camera facing the private pool and sundeck. This is not a common area such as reception or restaurant and in our opinion violation of our privacy and other guests (especially thinking that they could film your children!who knows who is on the other side and what happens with the material!)

This facility deserves is nothing more than a 2 star bed and breakfast.
I wonder how this place reached great ratings and people would tolerate to be filmed while walking around in their bikini.
We left as we didn‚Äôt feel comfortable to stay here!"

The staff is so polite and friendly, always at your service; they arranged our transport to and from the airport, and also got us a motorbike so we wouldn‚Äôt have to walk to get one.
They have a very convenient shuttle service to and from Ubud Palace, which you can book through Whatsapp.

One of our favourite meals in Ubud! From start to finish, everything we ate was absolutely delicious. The location was peaceful and the service was great.
Great value for EXCEPTIONAL food!! Our steak was cooked to perfection and the chocolate peanut butter cake was yummy and light. Everything we ate was packed with flavour - a truly wonderful meal.

It‚Äôs a little bit further out, but a lot better than some of the places we‚Äôve tried in Ubud centre. If you‚Äôre a foodie, this is the place for you.

Thank you for such a delicious meal Tulen team!","We come here to enjoy a delicious meal twice a month regularly. Here are my top food picks:

Lasagna:
The best vegetable lasagna I've ever eaten! Just like I make at home, with two sauces: red and white. Exceptionally delicious. A must-try!!!

Ravioli Shiitake:
Al dente and very pleasing.

Chicken Ties:
My husband's favorite. Very tender and healthy.

Ps very calm place during the day","This restaurant has a bit of parking and everything else but the best part of it was I Luh, the waitresss.

Tulen gives you the rice padi fields that‚Äôs quiet and away from the road. Mind you rice fields comes with the whole enchiladas (last time I was here, the farmer was burning things in the fields and the smoke wasn‚Äôt survivable).

The service by I Luh was awesome. She gives the best recommendations. We were not vegetarian and we turned into vegetarian for a night and were satisfied.

The food - as this is not my first time. The food quality has been quite consistent. The dishes were tasty. Their vegetarian burger was awesome and the Urap is must try because it is different from others in good and unique ways.

This restaurant is absolutely recommended if you are visiting or staying in the area.","Such a great find. Beautiful venue, delicious food, very friendly staff.
My husband was very happy with the steak one of the best. I loved the vegan burger. Kids very happy also.
