I recommend the customized fresh salad and fresh smoothie bowl.

They provide detox pressed juice too.
Overall is good, recommended.",Gorgeous Cafe and wonderful service. We had the tropical smoothie bowl and the poached eggs with smashed avocado and they were delicious. Great coffee and juices. They also have a lovely range of vegan desserts and healthful teas.  Definitely visit this Cafe when in Amed.,"Arrived to Amed and had the most nutritious, healthy, and delicious dinner possible here!

The rare cooked tuna was insane, the cappuccino very good as well and the fruit smoothie bowl next level! Very grateful to have found this place and for sure will come back as the quality is too good to be true. Amazing! Keep it up guys ü´∂üëè","I love going to Goodstuff, the food is amazing. My favourite dish is Green Power.
Friendly helpful staff and great relaxing atmosphere.","We‚Äôve been there nearly every day during our stay in Amed. Great coffee, cakes and would really recommend to try cold press juices and mie goreng."

The rooms and bathrooms however were not, there was a mouse in my room, the bathrooms had not been cleaned and so drains were blocked and toilets smelt.
Wasn‚Äôt made aware there wouldn‚Äôt be anyone running the hostel and so no food was available from the hostel for the last 2 days of my stay.","I‚Äôm sorry to inform that that all night you will hear and orchestra of dogs shouting and barking. And if you think for a second maybe they will go to sleep eventually, you are wrong they will continuously bark and shout for the whole night. Pure torture!","Local, authentic vibes with boasting views of the Volcano and the mountains. I highly recommend this place. Location is top notch: on scooter, the driving to and from Amed will be a pleasure (volcano, rice paddies). Rooms are spacious, huge lockers, beds spacious and self contained, AC, cute terrace. There is a warung downstairs with a varied, delicious menu, local and western fusion. Grilled eggplant with peanut sauce was the best (veggie here)!","Not the best hostel, you get what you pay. Bathroom was not clean. A/C was weak in the rooms.
Breakfast is two waffles with honey.","Super nice staff and great, cheap restaurant below! Rooms were also very good, with ac and nice beds! Even breakfast included for the great price"

The owner grills up a lovely fish in banana leaf and they have great spring rolls. Kind of a hidden gem. Nice sunset as well.,"One of my favorite places in Amed! There is 2nd floor with beautiful Agung mountain view. Melasti is peaceful area than beach side. All the foods are fresh and so delicious. Especially I love their local foods. and owner is so friendly, too! Highly recommend.","This warung was disappointing compared to the expectations set by the reviews.  The service was excellent and the view of the mountain was nice. However, the food lacked flavour. Chicken Ayam soup tasted like the seasoning came from a ramen packet. The fish curry broth was very thin and the fish could have been chicken, snake, lizard???...the texture wasn't not like fish. My husband's cashew chicken was a daily special and, very expensive at 80k compared to the rest of the menu, with a sauce that tasted straight out of the kecap Manis bottle.",Really nice little spot to look at all the beautiful nature enjoying some great food. The staff are also really lovely - would definitely recommend! Spring rolls are really delicious!!,Fabulous location with large windows giving a full vista of the volcano.  The food was also tasty.  Both the soto ayam and Balinese veg curry better than the average offering you often get.  Friendly family service.

It is ideally located in a quiet area of Amed but not far from many coffee shops, restaurants and the more touristic area. It has a good view on Mount Agung and the nearby hills. The apartment has two rooms, including a well-equipped kitchen and a bedroom with a comfortable bed. It is spacious enough for 2 persons. It also has 4 balconies. The wifi works well. It is most of the time fast enough to have a video call or watch a movie, but it is sometimes unstable, so you might experience interruptions during your calls. The guesthouse staff, Kadek was very accommodating to our requests. For those who like hiking/walking, there is a very nice trail just 3 minutes away by foot, to climb the closest hills. Overall, I can fully recommend this place. It is a perfect place to be for both short and long stays.","Excelent sleep quality, love the bed very comfortable","My parents stay there 2 months to visit me and they were really happy of the place. They rented the flat on the first floor.
You have a super nice view and it's quiet üôè‚ú®","I stay here last week for 5 nights. Its nice place, clean and new room, with aircon and hot water shower. No breakfast but i domt need that.

I was staying for 3 months on a budget and just needed a comfortable place in a good location with a kitchen. Then my friend recommended me Kungkungan house and I was blown away!!

The views of Mt. Agung and the neighbors' rice paddies are fabulous and the entire place is gated, simple, modest, open with lots of light, and very quiet. Friendly neighbors, too! Even friends and expats living in Amed came by and were jealous of the place! We also had someone cleaning once a week, which made the long stay super comfortable and comvenient.

The landlord Andre is so sweet and accomodating, and even when there is a power outage or other occurrence (you must remember Amed is a small town and these things happen), he always checked on us afterward. He often went beyond what is necessary to help us, which really added to the great experience!

We are planning to come back at the end of this year and I almost didn't want to leave a review and spread the word so there is a guaranteed place for us - but sadly, it would be a crime to keep this gem to myself. So I will cross my fingers and plan early - Enjoy the magic of Amed at Kungkungan!!",,,,

The restaurant is very clean with inside and outside seating. Location is easy to find. Good vibes only here üôèüôè","The owner is very friendly, the local food menu is delicious and very cheap.","Oh my word. What a great restaurant for some traditional Indonesian food! So good, and on another level when it come to affordability. I honestly think I‚Äôd come back here everyday if I was here for a longer period time. This is my second time in less the 24hrs. The owner is super lovely, and in the evening he whipped at some karaoke which was some great vibes. Only thing is, it‚Äôs family ran, and so it may take a little longer if the place is full, but we have had no trouble and it really deserves some love if you‚Äôre in the area.
