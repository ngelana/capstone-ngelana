We booked a tour with a guide for 500K idr for 2 people.  If you stay closer to the Waterfalls the locals can offer discounted passes but without the guides. We have been shown 3 waterfalls. Track was not  challenging, easy enough to walk withouta guide. It took us 4 hours of slow walking, stopping to enjoy views and take photos. On the way, you will find 2-3 small places to get something to drink or snack. Highly recommend.",Great place to trek and enjoy waterfalls. Yes 3 of them. Some level of fitness is required. Entrance fee for medium track (2 waterfalls) is 150k while long track (3 waterfalls) is 250k. Enjoy the refreshing air and get ready to get wet no matter what.,"impressive waterfall! The road through Kinmantani is a serpentine, but it was very exciting. official ticket at the box office costs 150,000 for the medium track, guide included. the climb is not the easiest, but it's worth it.",Wow what an incredible experience! The waterfalls are impressive from all view points. Upon arrival we bought a ticket for the medium track to two waterfalls (sekumpul and hidden) for 150.000 pp including the guide. The guide explained that there are 69 guides in the villages and they take turns. The entrance fee you have to pay creates income stream for the villagers and supports the maintenance of the path to the waterfalls. The walking path are well maintained stairs. If you can walk stairs you can do it. It is a short walk downstairs to both waterfalls and the views are spectacular! Highly recommend going here when you are in Bali!,"We read a lot of the reviews and were prepared for the worst, but had the most amazing experience!

We did arrive at the waterfall, where Yes, we payed 150k per person (took the midi trail), then drive our motorbikes to the furthest available point and had to walk maybe 20minutes down to waterfalls. When we reached the first one, it started to rain, so we were actually super happy that we had guide with us, who helped us no to slip on the rocks, carried bag for us, and took pictures and videos! At the end we had coffee and tea degustation for no extra charge, so it was really beautiful experience!"

Hidden, Sekumpul and Fiji waterfall.  Sekumpul is the tallest waterfall in Bali (80m) really a must see because it is incredible. Also not so many tourists  :). The entrance is 150k or 200k depending on how many you want to visit. I recommend to have a towel with you,  and a set of clothes because you will get wet also shoes that you can use in water or flip flops with a good greep. Enjoy!","I was going to go but the rude, insulting responses to negative reviews, from waterfall puts me off. Ive been travelling in Asia 8 months and not seen anything as expensive as this for what is described in the favourable reviews so - if it's a fair price - they should be prepared to explain their pricing without getting nasty.","The most beautiful waterfall in all of Bali! Lots of people complaining about the ticket price and the requirement to have a guide, but keep in mind that the way down is quite challenging. We found our guide to be very knowledgeable and helpful. He helped us carry our equipment and take some amazing photos too. Also, don't forget that the local community and economy around Sekumpul is highly dependant on the income from the waterfall as there are little to no other employment opportunities for them in the area, so when you do pay for these waterfall tickets around Bali you're also supporting the local people and are helping them to maintain these pathways for you to have a better overall experience too.","Had a wonderful time after feeling some dread and confusion over the 1 and 5 star reviews. It turns out scammers from a village some distance before the waterfall trekking entrance were stopping vehicles and demanding an entrance fee. These crims have been sent packing so now the ‘official’ trekking fee for a 3 hr trek is 250,000 which is well worth it. Highly recommended to go with a tour agency who can provide a driver who knows the area and can help you avoid any scammers. Sensational place","beautiful place and an even more stunning waterfall. please go here, you will not regret it. walking around here everything is lo vibrant and green and healthy, its like a slice of heaven. the waterfall is so spectacular. i would definitely also recommend seeing fiji waterfall and the hidden waterfall, they are both gery close by and equally as stunning!!"

You will be asked for 150 or 250k for the tour to the waterfalls BUT if you just want to go to the view point just say that and give only 20k. And then go to the viewpoint. If you change your mind at the view point you can go down and the price is 150k but you can say that you dont want a guide. View is amazing here. We stay in Bali for 60days but if I had only 10days I just recommend to pay and go down the path.","DON'T PAY FOR A GUIDE!
You're supporting a local mafia, by doing this.

Just pay for the view (2x 20.000, first for Sekumpul, second for Fiji), which already is the entrance ticket, and go in, ignore these rip-off-guys who tell that you wouldn't be allowed to enter - it's a scam. They want to sell you massively overpriced guides for a very easy to walk path.

The waterfalls are really beautiful and going there is a very nice little hike!

Hopefully government turns off that rip-off local mafia, soon.","Great view of Sekumpul & Fiji falls as you first start walking down to get closer.

My main post is on Sekumpul Waterfalls page.",Ticket Only 20k / person,"Beautiful view point for 20.000 IDR. The path is a bit slippery, so be careful.
Be aware of scam: there are options of 150.000 IDR and 250.000 IDR for a short and long waterfall walk with guide, but they won’t tell you that you can go to a viewpoint for 20.000 IDR."

Rooms were perfect and great for value.
Breakfast is included.
Food is great.
Not a bad thing to say about the place.

I would definitely stay there again.","The homestay exceeded expectations in every way. The discounted prices for the waterfalls (50000) and Fiji (20000) were a fantastic deal. The view through the window was simply mesmerizing, creating a serene atmosphere. Dining at their restaurant was a delight, with delicious food adding to the overall satisfaction. The warmth and friendliness of the owners made the stay truly special. A five-star experience that I highly recommend to anyone seeking a memorable getaway! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","It was ok. We made the mistake of booking the place for 3 nights. I think for one night the room is bearable, longer than that is not recommended. They have two new rooms (newly built so maybe the quality is vastly different from the room we stayed in) and the rest of the rooms are old. Our room smelled moldy but I couldn't find mold except inside the wooden closet. The wifi was really bad and the internet connection from our phone provider wasn't the best inside the room. We basically couldn't use much internet inside the room. Throughout our stay they never emptied our trash or gave us more toilet paper (we ran out the one roll that was in the bathroom). The water heater must be so old bc the water was hardly even lukewarm. The towels had very suspicious looking stains.

I understand that this is a homestay and not a hotel so we didn't really have high expectations to begin with but I have had much better experience in other homestay accommodations that I've been to. The owner will give you some kind of badge and tell you that you can go to Sekumpul without a guide and for a cheaper price bc you were staying there but I don't think it's true. The price is normal (30k for sekumpul, 20k for Fiji) bc we go through the route without people scamming us to pay for a guide. The route is very close to the homestay.","One of recommended BnB in the area. View of restaurant is amazing. We got the last room hence view is not that great.

Breakfast is rather simple. The omelette is not what you think as western but rather as indo style omelette with cabbage (lots of it) and carrot, and 1 slice of milk bread.

You can just walk up to waterfalls, lovely scene with local life while passing.

Great location, good host, clean room condition.","Amazing location close to Sekumpel. Also, Sugi hooks you up with a pass to get into the waterfall at a very discounted rate. He also did a nice coffee / tea tasting for us. It was a short but very nice stay."

Really nice host. A few minutes away from 3 waterfalls.

It would have been an all 5 stars review but: the good location also makes it a very noisy place, motorbikes and dogs barking constantly (even late at night and very early morning). Also, the food was good at the restaurant but my wife got food poisoning with tuna one evening.","this hotel is even more amazing than the photos show.  And then there's the staff... Agus is an amazing host!  He and all the staff made sure we had a great stay, from arranging transport from the airport to giving us the advice that we should do the waterfall tour on a different day than we had planned as it would be much quieter, plus great hospitality and food  delicious for every meal.  We cannot recommend a stay at Sekumpul accommodation highly enough and will definitely stay there again when we come back to north Bali!","An incredibly beautiful place to relax.  Agus is a very friendly owner, always helpful and immediately responds to all requests.  Everything is clean and well maintained.  Not to forget the excellent restaurant.  Everything is freshly prepared and tastes great.  if you stay at sekumpul accommodation you get the best option to visit sekumpul waterfall,, walk 10 minutes to the waterfall alone and pay only 30k to enter as they will give you an identity card.  That's what we do and I think it's the best option to enjoy yourself the waterfalls around the area and help the local people instead of being a con.",Amazing place to stay for really fair price with great service! Strongly recommended if you want to check out the waterfalls and stay in quiet & cozy place to rest in the mountains. Gotta come back again! 👍,"We wanted to visit Sekumpal Waterfall. We are glad that we stayed here. It would have been really sad to drive out after seeing and experiencing such a great waterfall.
There are 3 rooms with a verandah and a great view at the upper level and 1 smaller room at a lower level.
Pros:
1.Location absolutely next to the gate of the best waterfall in Bali.
2. Discount passes, which allows you to visit the 2 waterfalls at 30.000 idr instead of the scam by the local goons, which forces you to cough up ten times the money.
3. Great value for money. It was the cheapest room we had in Bali.
4. Specious and comfortable room.
5. Rock cut toilet with an open to sky skylight
6. Lovely mountain view.
7. Good landscape and site development
8. Good food and breakfast
9. Great hosts Agus and his wife
10. The sky that's seen from here is fabulous.  Millions of stars.

Cons:
1. The geyser didn't work for a long time.
2. No AC, but it didn't make a difference because this is a mountain resort, and it's cool. They had a tower fan. We were comfortable in September 23.
3. The road that leads to the Sekumpal waterfall and accommodation is narrow and steep. The driver has to be an expert.
4. One has to have his own transportation to come here. We had our car so we were fine.

Overall,  it was our best decision to stay here."

We also ate delicious handmade vanilla ice cream there!

In the end, we bought almost 1.5 kg of coffee from the owners (1 kg kopi luwak) and left very happy. We wanted to go back there, but it was very far away because we were in a different part of the island.

That first night we were very happy with room and ordered food at the attached restaurant. The reviews are glowing. Our gado gados were just the worst thing I've eaten. I had to return mine. The explanation was that the owner's wife was out buying groceries so his uncle prepared the meal which was not to the usual standard. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt considering all the positive reviews and how motivated they were to make sure we were happy.
