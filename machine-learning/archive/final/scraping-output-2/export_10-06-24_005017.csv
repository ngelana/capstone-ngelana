The best teachers & most beautiful life long memories madeü´∂üèº Forever grateful,"The room I‚Äôve got is a private room so It was nice and clean. But my friends got the downstairs room for 2-4 people and it‚Äôs full with mold. The building needs a lot of upgrade for sure. The staffs were absolutely nice! They‚Äôre the best and the location is based on where you want to go. If you want to go to Ubud it‚Äôs quite far but if you‚Äôd like to be in the nature, this is the place.","One of the most amazing, life changing experiences of my life. Very chill and relaxing environment, filled with amazing staff and teachers! I highly recommend to anyone looking to be a yoga teacher or just to deepen your practice. Thank you house of Om ",Overall I have really enjoyed my time at house of Om. The teachers are so amazing and knowledgeable and the location is perfection. There is a black mould issue which needs to be addressed in the rooms - the surface level cleaning is good but due to the black mould - a bunch of people were developing sickness.,House of  üïâÔ∏è has been the perfect place where I got my 200H YTT. The location is surrounded by amazing nature and it's perfect if you want to really focus on your personal journey. Accommodation is comfortable and food is very tasty. The school management is taking care of creating a conscious community and giving the best experience ‚ú® I could feel a lot of love and have a real experience of what YOGA means! ‚ù§Ô∏è

All the waitresses are so kind, ambience is good, esp when they switched their playlist from loud music to the calmer tunes. It‚Äôs already good but there‚Äôs always room for improvement.","I can't say this place is fancy, yet it has place in my heart (& mind). I didn't expect that I'd find place like this in Gianyar area (I live in Denpasar, so I have no idea about this). Small place, yet they can make everything looks comfy & cozy. The food is affordable & tasty, the music they choose uplift the mood (some places sometimes choose sad music/sad song/ballad for a cafe, not really a thing for me. Staffs are very nice too. If I may give just one suggestion for the owner & staff, maybe you can remove the plastics (small containers for sauces, straw) and use something else for substitute. Overall, I recommend this place for people who want to enjoy their afternoon break.",Ordered twice. Turned my belly inside out twice. Cannot recommend at all.,small portion and not expensive but the taste is pricelessü•∫‚ú®üí´,"I order take out from Gojek, cost around 80,000 IDR. The food tastes just ok, but the portion is so small. The ice coffee I order look completely different from the image on Gojek and Google, full of ice and cost 19,000 IDR which is quite expensive. Fish and Chip portion are also small, and fish has a lot of batter with few piece of fries."
