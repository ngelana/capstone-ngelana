Walking around trying to appreciate the village was difficult as people are trying to earn through the tourist which I don't blame them for. While talking around learn how difficult it's for them and more than half the population have moved away to find good jobs and opportunities.
Do visit the area as the people living there are so kind.","Tenganan Village is a wonderful place to visit if you want to experience the authentic culture and tradition of Bali. They are also known for their unique crafts, such as the double ikat weaving of geringsing cloth.The village is surrounded by beautiful nature.I enjoyed walking around the village, seeing the traditional houses. I highly recommend Tenganan Village to anyone who wants to see a different and rich side of Bali.üçÉüíö","While the village was incredibly nice and well preserved and our guide was super informative and interesting we walked to the end of the village, north gate, only to see that all the plastic trash is thrown down the hill towards the river.

Signs everywhere are saying do not do this. But they are not working. The village needs to educate the residents in waste management. This is not a good solution.","Hire the tour guide at the front from the village! There is so much history, very fascinating. Highly recommend to do while in east bali. But be sure to have a driver stay or you won‚Äôt have an easy way out.","Amazing and not to many guests
But i think day by day and year by year litle bit will upgrade the old house"
