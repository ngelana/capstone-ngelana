Overall was nice.

Waiting time around 30 mins for food to served on your table.
Toilet is also clean. If you bring a car, maybe a bit difficult to park when crowded.","Love the food here, very close resemblance like the ones in Malaysia and Singapore. The only one thing I dislike was the greasy floor  and I almost slip.","Warung Bunana offers a cozy ambiance and delicious canai bread. The bread is perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, making it a delightful treat. The menu features a variety of flavors to choose from. It's a great spot to enjoy tasty canai bread in a relaxed setting.","It was confusing to order. No one gave you menu and no one tell you anything. I had to asked for a menu, turns out you you have to order at the cashier.

The place was dirty and the area to wash hands and toilet was a disaster. No soap, clogged and I don't think it has ever seen a scrub in a long time!

Ordered the roti cannai L size doesn't seems that big so I can't tell the difference. The roti cannai was a bit under cooked it wasn't crispy and a bit doughy for my liking.

The curry was not authentic not even close to anything an Indian, Malaysian not even Indonesian taste. More like plain not enough species just dominant salt and somewhat spicy.

The tea tarik was not bad .

The concept is nice but can improve on service and taste.","Good place for snacking, we ate martabak, canai tambal, canai susu, teh tarik, & buttermilk
Overall the food & drink taste good."

It‚Äôs located in a bustling part of East Denpasar redlight junction with a little patio.
Fun spot to meet and hangout with nice vibes.","The ambience is super nice and quite tranquil, even if the location is right beside the traffic light.
Most of the dishes are delish.
I recommend the karubi if you like beef, but if you love spicy, their sambal mbe is a must üî•üî•üî•
Their club sandwich portion are big and very fulfilling with lots of meat
For the drinks, the coffee is great.
Would love to come again, even for just coffee sipping, working, or reading books."

Even though they put up signs saying to keep mask on all the time, but they did not even wear them. They continue to do this even after i have asked them to put masks on.

Definitely not coming back, such a shame though. I used to like this place.","The place was cozy but what a shame that in the midst of pandemic all of their team members (staff, cashier, waitress) don't use face mask.
