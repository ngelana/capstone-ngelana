A great place for any kind of events such as meetings, wedding ceremony, birthday party, anniversary, gala dinner, product launching, etc.
Also a nice place for family dinner, or lunch on social gathering with friends

they have a lot of selection room for different capacity. Huge outdoor space, big hall, large meeting room, small meeting room, and also some small room equipped with karaoke facilities.

Not only the place was good, but their food is really delicious. one of the best chinese food in Bali. Few times of visit and trying different menu each time. The result? The taste is only good and very good. I never found bad one.

A lot of parking space.

Good service with friendly staff.

A chinese restaurant with good food, good space and good service.",The foods are delicious. Maybe they need to consider the order of food served and during the day for lunch it a bit hot. It is good place for big weeding and group party. They have huge parking area and big entrance. The staffs are kind and polite.,"Big restourant with ballroom.. Capacity until 2000 people with round table & personal chair..

The food is funtastic delicious..
Many event using that place.. Like Fashion show, wedding ceremonial, etc..

In middle school, my friends and I went on vacation to Bali and stayed here. lots of things to do here. You can have fun, play, even be sad at this hotel. In my opinion, this hotel's service is very good. The hotel staff are also friendly. But it's just that the rooms are a bit lacking. Over all it was comfortable, but the shower in my bathroom was broken. When I use, it only turns on in hot water. when I turn, it gets hotter. So my body was a bit hot when using it at that time. The food is delicious, there is a swimming pool too. But it's a bit of a miss, the location is far from destination and minimarkets.

Don‚Äôt waste your money and time watching this performance. It costs IDR 150k, the performers were not professional at all. They were chit chatting and laughing on the stage among themselves while performing.
You will never understand the story because their act is really bad even though you got a summary of the story in English. Go do something else instead of coming here‚Ä¶ seriously","This is not for kids at all, the jokes they used is 17+. You will not get the story even though they give you the storyline paper. If you searching for traditional and cultural experience, this place is not going to give you any of it. The actual story is only 10-15 minutes but because they put a lot of unnecessary jokes and interactions this takes longer (about 1 hour).
After that, they might offer photos together with actors, but i recommend to DO NOT take any photo with them. They ask for money after taking the photo (not beforehand). They asked for a certain amount of money (for me it is too much) and they charged per person. So if you take a group photo, you all have to pay (mine was IDR 20K per person). Few of them not charging a lot (IDR 2K or 5K) is fine.",Traditional dance with a bit of drama and comedy. Was a little awkward the comedy part to see with kids. While taking photos Barong secretly asked for money. That was a bit unprofessional. Ticketed show so already paid for it before entering.,Such a fun experience! A beautiful dance and the story of it is so meaningful with talented dancer and traditional music player.,"Don't waste your time and money. Such a boring dance and you've to pay IDR 100K for entrance which is super expensive. The pace of the whole act is super slow and they just drag a 10 min show to 1 hour.

Just an trap to make some money from the tourist. The photo might looks good but trust me you can't even bear it for 5 min so please avoid this place."

Food wise they operate by a vegetarian philosophy, with no byproducts created by harming animals.

We ordered the Mi goreng and the premade spring roll and deep fried banana. Luckily we use Google translate to get a rough translation. With a cold Spring water, it came down to about 40k RP.

The food was decent, a tad spicy for my tastes and the banana was a little stale. Mind you we arrived at 430 pm, which is when they close. Overall though was a nice experience and happy to find another cheap, friendly, vegetarian warung!"
