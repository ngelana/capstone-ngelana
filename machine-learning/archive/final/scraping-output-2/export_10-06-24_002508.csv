I've been to Bali several times and am tired of the masses of tourists and traffic jams of Canggu, Kuta, etc. I was looking for a quiet, private area to relax in and I found it here. The villa looks like these photos and is set in a patch of jungle surrounded by jackruit, durian, cacao and coffee trees. One afternoon I even had a visit from a monkey that came and hung out on the back railing. I went for a walk every day through the surrounding rice fields and was awed by the scenery. The area around the villa is picture postcard worthy. There are rice fields, jungle, and mountains in the distance. The villa manager, Kadek, is able to help line up scooters, laundry, etc. He was available 24/7 and lived only a few minutes away if there was an issue. The air-conditioning in the bedroom makes sleeping comfortable, although it wasn't needed every night. The villa is surrounded by a wall which gives complete privacy while swimming or taking a nap by the pool. I will hopefully be able to return for an even longer stay.",Looks great. Nice and cheap,Nice,,
