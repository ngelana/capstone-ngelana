We will return for sure! üòäüôèüôè",A good place to spend the afternoon and enjoy its affordable menus. all food tastes good. I like the view of the vast rice field  and sea. You can even see Nusa Dua lights if you cone here in the late afternoon. The only annoying thing is the mosquitoes. Better bring the mosquito repellent next time.,"A nice local warung in the middle of beautiful rice paddies in Tabanan. We ordered mujair nyat-nyat, ikan goreng, ayam kecombrang and for dessert, banana fritters and everything was delicious.

Ibu Dayu herself served the food and spare her time to talk to us with her beautiful smile and a genuine Balinese hospitality.

After eating, we hang out at the warung just to enjoy the peaceful ambience that we couldn‚Äôt find anywhere else.",This is by far the best food I have had in Bali.
