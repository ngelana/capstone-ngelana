We spent a lovely lazy week here and totally recommend this area and hotel for anyone seeking to settle in to a quieter more relaxing side of Bali.

Excellent staff and service, beautiful spa, and enough tasty food options inside and around the resort.

Decent snorkelling just off the bay and easy options to hire gear or go further afield to dive or snorkel.

Would definitely come back to candi beach and this resort.","A beautiful hotel at the east side of bali. Service was excellent. The environment feels relaxing, beachfront, and they have good restaurants available. We booked through luxury escapes which had some inclusions that provided us with free meals and massages. Everything was top notch. The villa with private pool is spacious, modern and had a beautiful view. Highly recommended.","We stayed 5 nights in a luxury pool villa which was beautiful and really private. The staff were all fantastic and the service was outstanding. By far, the best service I've ever experienced anywhere in the world. They went above and beyond.

The beach was nice and the water was surprisingly clear. During high tide, there is no beach but still lovely to swim in. The spa which overlooks the ocean was stunning and we had a lovely massage.

The only letdown was the Indonesian food which is clearly modified to cater to Westerners - too sweet and not spicy. We enjoyed the Italian food at Basil, though. Aside from that, we had such a great holiday! Would love to return again one day and have already recommended this resort to friends.

Thank you to all the staff who made this a truly special experience.","We were not happy in Ubud and wanted a break from the chaos. Candi was exactly this, and coming in to our Villa took my breath away. The views, the attention to the gardens, maintenance, plants, and the guests too, is exceptional. Even the restaurant was not expensive compared to other local Balinese places we have been to. The beach is extremely clean, and the sun beds and maintained and tended to. The breakfast buffet is awesome. No complaints. You should go if you want a care-free trip.","We just enjoyed 5 nights in a luxury pool villa & had an amazing time!  Whilst the villa, private pool & day bed were all incredible, the outstanding feature of this resort is the staff.  10/10 for genuine friendliness & helpfulness.  There‚Äôs literally nothing I can suggest that would have made our stay better."

I was charmed that they had a yoga class for staff. And later for guests. Also a mini golf that we didn‚Äôt quite get round to using. Good pool and restaurant is a nice space partially over the water. We upgraded and our room was very spacious. Nice to have a private veranda.

Food ok but better off going to Vincent‚Äôs üòä","Lovely resort to relax, very well kept. Staff good, breakfast and restaurant good. Nice pool area, plenty of space and beds. No beach, but beds that face the sea. Free bikes and shuttle, spa and nice small gym. Perfect for a few days rest. The manager of the restaurant Kadek was wonderful, nothing to much trouble, very friendly and welcoming ü•∞

Food was great and the views from the restaurant was spectacular üòç there is a free daily shuttle into town if you want to do shopping or explore cafe's and restaurants.

The resort has a very calm atmosphere with beautiful villas, restaurant and is very clean. The staff are very helpful and anything you need they will organize for you to the point where they actually made me a dish that wasn‚Äôt on their menu for my dietary requirements (I don‚Äôt know if they will still do this).

The pool is big and perfect temperature - not hot or cold and it is cleaned regularly.

Breakfast is great with a selection of fruits, juices, egg dishes, a few other dishes, pastries and tea and coffee. The fresh juices are delicious.

I will definitely be coming back üòÅ","Extremely clean, beautiful ocean side resort with lovely pool and tasty restaurant with extensive breakfast options. The best part of staying here was the service - we stayed only 1 night, but we were going on a snorkeling trip and asked if we could come back and shower even though we had checked out. Our previous room was being used, so they prepared a DIFFERENT room for us to shower in. It was raining very hard and they offered to walk us to the room with umbrellas. Would definitely stay again!","Most value asset of this resort is definitely the staff, they make you fill very welcoming. Food was also excellent and the cocktails didn't miss any alcohol. Rooms are well maintained and the toilet are really clean.

Only downside from my point is the gym, it could use some more weight, but it did a trick üòÄ","The staff was very friendly and the grounds were nicely laid out. However, the rooms showed significant wear and had a musty smell. For instance, the mosquito nets were stained and in need of replacement, as were various furnishings like faded mirrors and stained toilet seats. The restaurant was overpriced for the quality of food offered, a stark contrast to other places in Bali offering better quality at similar or lower prices. Additionally, the service in the restaurant was very slow, and prices were net, with a 21% charge for service and taxes added later, which was not the case in other hotels. Even setting the table was an extra charge for hotel guests. Despite the beautiful seafront location, the preferred seating areas were not well serviced, possibly due to their distance from the bar.","A great stay at Nirwana, with 2 kids (3 & 5).
4 nights. Had two bungalows.

Perfect stay having just landed from UK. Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of other parts of Bali - so we could get over jet lag.

Wi-Fi worked perfectly. Streamed loads of stuff without hassle (in contradiction to some other reviews).
Restaurant was lovely - same menu for lunch and dinner though.

Wife went to spas etc nearby via taxi (included in spa‚Äôs price).

Pool is as beautiful as pictures suggest.

Great service. Staff are the friendliest we had during our trip to Bali."

Very good Indian food restaurant.. Dosas are on another level. Very tasty sambhar. Pani puri was outstanding. Onion rings were good too.

Overall, a very good place to have indian food during your Bali tour.","I give 5 stars for the food and service. Qnara serves delicious authentic Indian dishes in the middle of stereotype cafe foods in Candidasa. Really gives refreshing diversity to foods choice to get there. From rice, paratha, tandoori, thali paneer, all there for you to choose.
So many major spelling mistakes on the menu, and the place is quite warm with floor fan only, but all forgiven with their foods taste.","Everyone has mentioned this so I‚Äôm going to go ahead & mention it anyway. Do not be turned off by the appearance. This isn‚Äôt like a proper restaurant that you would expect but rather like a Dhaba style place.

Food here is amazing‚Ä¶most authentic Indian we have had in Bali till now. And the surprising thing is that both owner & chef üë®üèΩ‚Äçüç≥ are not Indians but Balinese!

The food tastes like proper Indian like we would have it back in India. We don‚Äôt even get this taste in Sydney. I would recommend this place to anyone who visits this. Please do dine in here atleast once.

We went for dinner the day we arrived & then skipped complimentary breakfast in resort & went to Qnara for breakfast.

Daal tadka, eggs bhurji, romaali roti, paneer chilli dry, masala dosa, masala tea, you order anything & you won‚Äôt be disappointed!

I definitely plan to come back and try more items from their menu next time.",Great food! The best Balinese dishes i‚Äôve tried actually! They are adorable and the place is wonderful. Great service by the sea and super clean! If you‚Äôre staying in Candi Beach Resort don‚Äôt hesitate to pay them a visit. The food is way better than in the resort and half the price. 100% recommendable.,"Great place. This is owned/operated by the same people as Lu Putu restaurant.  Both places will pick you up from your hotel and shuttle you to their establishment free of charge.  Had lunch at Lu Putu and asked the driver about snorkeling. He drove us here and let us hang out and use their facilities/ beach access free of charge.  Found out they have hotel rooms too, with bookable spa service. Only had their Gelato, but it was great (which is no surprise, considering how good Lu Putu was). Will likely stay here next time we're in Bali.",Very nice balinese restaurant. Delicious food and nice people. Very good service. It is located directly on the beach between the Basil Restaurant and the Candi Beach resort.,"We had the famous Gelato (ice cream) which was delicious. The prices were a bit over the top for indonesian standards but considering it's part of a hotel it's not too bad after all. The service was friendly but a very very slow paced. I'd recommend it, the food looked good too!"

It is located on the small village around the hotels and bungalows in Sengkidu. I love the ice cream and the vibes here.,"We have been coming to Bali for years and are always looking forward to the coffee from Mendira House. We even claim that we have not yet drunk a better one in Germany. The team is super nice and the boss is very sympathetic. This time he even made it possible for us to take the coffee with us to Germany. But there is not only delicious coffee at Mendira House, but also very high-quality and tasteful souvenirs, we will find something for ourselves or for friends every time we visit. We are already looking forward to our next holiday in Bali and our daily coffee at Mendira House.","A little gift shop that primarily serves this small road and village. It has EXCELLENT green tea ice cream made from real matcha. Coffee is made using beans from Kintamari - more bitter and robust, not so fruity.",Cosy souvenir shop with a cafe and ice cream. Nice gifts made in Bali.,"I love the details of this cute little shop in Sengkidu, Candidasa area! The interior design is lovely, the items sold are in good quality and neatly displayed, the handmade ice cream is very tasty, and the staff is friendly. It‚Äôs a must visit shop to buy some souvenirs or get a cup of coffee/ice cream if you happen to visit Candidasa!"

This place is underrated and as Warung go in Candidasa certainly the best surroundings and most pleasant place to sit. Pork ribs were beautifully cooked (and nice to see them being grilled on the BBQ at the front of the Warung over coconut husks). My wife had beautiful chicken that was wonderfully tender. Highly recommended.","We ate here several times during our stay at Candidasa. Excellent quality food for an affordable price.
They grill the chicken using dry coconuts instead of charcoal and they add some sort of barbacue sauce that is excellent.

After trying a number of different plates I ended up ordering a Nasi Goreng and a Ayam Gayak (grilled chicken) due to the portion size. I am a hungry person üòÖ

The only thing I can criticise is that there is no soap to wash your hands.

It is a great place to eat in the area.","Awesome food, cooked to order, sweet service staff. The extra time for your dishes to be BBQed over corn husks make it special. Ate here three times over a week because it‚Äôs so good.","Much like everyone else‚Äôs and experience, there are not many choices to eat around these parts in terms of warungs as the majority are closed. This was one of the first places that we found to be quite solid on the fact that there is ample seating and it is outdoor which brings in a nice breeze.

The menu is pretty solid with a variety of Indonesian and western dishes so there is a lot to choose from.

As my partner and I were craving chicken we both ended up ordering the Paket Ayam Goreng which is fried chicken leg with rice and some side veggies for 55k. The chicken was fried nicely where the skin was crispy and the meat was tender.

It‚Äôs a pretty average experience where you know the food will be good and it is nothing out of the ordinary.

The staff overall was pretty nice and attentive and the kitchen was quite quick with pushing out our food. She even showed us the side veggies that it came with which was very nice of the chef.

The most important thing to note is that it is very clean and the food was cooked well.","Really friendly team that‚Äôs works here, you can see they‚Äôre a tight nit family that is very hospitable towards visitors and wants to share with them the beautiful Bali culture and cuisine!

Food is amazing! Especially the grilled garumi - we haven‚Äôt had it better anywhere else!"

The staff were professional as well as very happy and helpful.,"The restaurant directly across from Candi Resort entrance is cash only so I just needed to walk up for another minute and discovered this Warung which takes credit card for an additional 2% fee.

They provide a welcome drink for new customers which is a nice touch!

Food was good and plentiful and drinks were strong!  Food here is cheaper than resort restaurant food and they have extensive menu options.

Interesting enough Candi Resort  wifi works in the restaurant even though it is 110 meters away! It loads pages slowly but it can definitely get you through a meal

At the end of my meal, I was offered a 15% discount on my next visit so I came back the next day.

I didn't  realize the coupon I was given had a very specific ""Use On"" date instead of a typical EXPIRATION date. This was odd and rendered the discount useless as I wouldn't be in the area on the Use ON date.

Hopefully they rethink this policy especially if the whole intention of the discount is to encourage repeat customers and build up their customer base.",Great food and amazing service by very friendly staff. Recommend it warmly!
