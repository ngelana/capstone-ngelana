Stayed here for 3 nights while getting PADI advanced scuba certification.
Diving with divemaster Sam and crew was a lot of fun - I felt safe on my dives and with the equipment I rented.
Great location if you want a remote destination to disconnect and separate from the general tourist and party crowd.
It‚Äôs near a small fishing village and there are no other restaurants or shops in walking distance so there‚Äôs not much to do except scuba diving, sitting by the pool, or walking on the beach. Loved that.
Spa facilities pretty basic, although after a spa body scrub treatment the included bath was lukewarm and less than half full in a small tile room under fluorescent lighting, which I think could be improved with candles or some better ambiance. The scrub was nice, though.
I kept the door to my bathroom closed most of the time since there was no glass over the concrete light openings in the wall by the shower and I didn‚Äôt want to deal with bugs.","Just amazing place for anyone but especially for divers or people becoming one.
Easy to reach but still very quiet and away from all the hassle.
Clean and roomy rooms with really good beds and nice bathrooms.
Diving is just great and sites easy to reach. Everything is handled professionally and instructors/divemasters know what they are diving.
Restaurant has wide menu of all kinds of dishes with really reasonable prices. Tasty food!
Staff in overall is very friendly and they will take care of you. Would recommend this ten times of ten.","My wife and I spent 11 nights at Bali Dive Resort and Spa in Tulamben in October 2023. I booked this trip through BlueWater Travel, which always provides excellent service.

The resort offers great value. It's spacious and well-managed, with large and comfortable rooms. The dive operation is top-notch! Everything is well-organized, and everyone is friendly and helpful.

During our stay, I did 21 dives in Tulamben and two in Amed. All dives were either from a rocky shore or a jukung (Balinese boat). Tulamben is mainly for macro and muck photography, but there are a number of 'wide angle' sites with nice corals.

Finnish sauna on the beach with icy cold plunge front of sauna. After long diving day, this will be the ultimate relaxation and memorable experience. Highly recommended!!!","An amazing place for diving related activities. The resort has PADI diving  centre housed in its premises.

Although I did not stay in this resort, I found the place quite amiable in terms of staff, infrastructure and location.

I had been to this resort to get my scuba diving certification and was fortunate to have been trained and certified under Rabi ( 414337). Got a lot to learn from a person who has 2000+ dive logs. He made sure that, I along with 3 of my friends had our basics right before diving into the ocean.

Along with him, Mika and other PADI staff have been accommodating to get us through our scuba diving lessons.

I‚Äôd recommend this to anybody who‚Äôs diving around Tulamben. reason being:- efficient transport service, professional diving equipment, experienced diving instructors and more importantly, beautiful dive locations around this coast."

The spacious and immaculately clean rooms with comfortable beds ensured a restful sleep every night. The cozy seating area outside our room provided a stunning view of the sea and the volcano, making every moment feel special.

Each morning, Komang delighted us with delicious banana pancakes drizzled with honey, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruit. The crispy fried bananas were a crunchy treat that we looked forward to every day. The beautiful pool was our afternoon haven, perfect for cooling off in the warm weather.

A highlight of our stay was the diving experience offered by the adjacent dive school. After practicing in the pool, we embarked on our first two fantastic dives, which were nothing short of magical.

In summary, our stay at Villa Saudara was nothing short of delightful. We left with cherished memories and a promise to ourselves to return to this little slice of paradise.","Villa Saudara was simply magical!  Made and Belinda were the consumate hosts of this lovely property. Their staff was terrific keeping our villa clean and preparing delicious breakfasts.

They also made arrangements for a private Balinese cooking class and dinner, three hours of massages in the villa,  helped us order pizza and arranged for their driver, Locko, to pick us up at the cruise terminal, chauffer us around Ubud and deliver us to the airport.  They even recommended numerous restaurants that had wonderful offerings to feed our bodies along with our senses.

We highly recommend staying at this lovely property when you visit Ubud. We will definitely return to Bali and stay at Villa Saudara!","I was there for the weekend while diving and I really enjoyed the time there. Brenda, the owner, and all the staff are absolutely lovely and made me feel at home. The room was confy and clean and I enjoyed the quietness of the place. I recommend it!","We did a dive with Tulamben Diving and decided to stay here for the night. I was pleasantly surprised with the place. Brand new and clean, the family that runs it is super kind and helpful. They even arranged a Balinese massage for us in the evening :)

Great value for the price as well. Highly recommended. (The rooms upstairs have a cool view.)",Lovely place to stay! The room was clean and the beds were comfy. We had the best banana pancakes it the morning with a stunning view of the mountains in the background. The best host I had so far during my stay in bali. Very welcoming and helps wherever he can. If you are up there don‚Äôt hesitate to book a diving trip with him. Had such a good experience. Highly recommend!
