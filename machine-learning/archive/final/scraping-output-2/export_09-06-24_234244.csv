150K per person. You have a guide but they ask you to tip him again. During the tour you will be catch by a lot of people who will try to ask you money, offer you fruits, photo and so on.","Besakih Temple, love the structure and visited by locals as well as tourist. There were no crowds during weekday when we visited . We paid for the tickets and was ask to wrap a sarong around our waist, this is included in the ticket. Tickets also include a local guide too. Highly recommended place to visit.","I had the most awe-inspiring experience visiting Besakih Great Temple in Bali! This sacred place is an absolute must-see for anyone exploring this beautiful island. From the moment I stepped foot inside, I was enchanted by the ancient architecture, lush surroundings, and the spiritual atmosphere that permeates every corner.

The towering pagodas, intricately carved stone structures, and the breathtaking view of Mount Agung in the background make Besakih Temple an architectural marvel and a photographer's dream. The energy here is truly special, and it's impossible not to feel a sense of peace and serenity while wandering through its sacred grounds.

The temple's history and significance are fascinating, and the knowledgeable guides on-site can provide you with a deeper understanding of the cultural and spiritual importance of this place. Whether you're a history buff, a spiritual seeker, or simply someone looking for a unique and enriching experience, Besakih Temple has something to offer everyone.

I highly recommend visiting during sunrise or sunset when the temple takes on a magical glow. Make sure to dress respectfully and explore the various shrines and courtyards. And don't forget to bring your camera to capture the beauty of this ancient wonder.

Besakih Temple is a true gem of Bali, and I can't wait to return. Don't miss the opportunity to immerse yourself in the rich culture and history of this remarkable place. It's an experience you'll cherish forever!",Beautiful temple with scenic backdrop close to sleeping volcano… must visit in Bali.. buy a sarong in night market as all temples need you to ware to cover below waist…,"Biggest Hindu temple in Bali. The atmosphere is calming and tourists need to dress properly. Many locals would insist on offering guidance during the visit and usually they will charge a lot at the end. Some would even lie that going with a guide is mandatory, while it’s not. Everyone is free to walk there, but please remain respectful."
