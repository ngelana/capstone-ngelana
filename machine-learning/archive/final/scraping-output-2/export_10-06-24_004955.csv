The vibe surprised me. Really relaxing groovy and the food as well delivered in portion, taste and price! Iced matcha milk, avocado smoothie, bebek goreng and their fried (dry / tossed in sauce) noodles!

Dig the wooden table made from actual tree. Rarely get to sit and dine on tables like this where I‚Äôm from :)

Hard to believe this oasis appeared when I was hungry and lost haha. Please visit and keep this place alive!","Honestly, I think I‚Äôll miss this the most when I leave Bali. One of my first suppers in Bali and the handmade noodles were SO GOOD! Sad that I couldn‚Äôt eat it one more time before leaving. Feeling starved just thinking about this.","Espectacular food, great staff and best prices. A hidden gem to enjoy Bali.

Yoga, Kirana, Rahman, Mita and the other staff were super helpful and attentive.

Beautiful decoration, full of tress and nature and great music.

Best place!!","Excellent food for a crazy price. We ordered 6 drinks, 5 appetizers and a meal, all for under $10 USD. The food was delicious and I would abstain recommend if you are in the area.","Amaaaazing! Nice vibe, beautiful place. Amazing looking & tasting food and drinks!

Spotless comfy bedroom, fully furnished with high quality furniture and well maintained. Each room has a small private kitchen and nice bathroom with hot water. It's equipped with large TV, AC, high speed wifi, small fridge, stove and some basic cooking utensils. They provide cleaning service once a week, but doesn't include laundry. It also has small backyard for every room. What I like most is the front yard. It's huge!! Everyday they will sweep the grass and clean the fallen leaves. I can totally sit by the big window door of my room, soak up the sun and chill. The owner, Pak Gusti, is very friendly, kind, and responsive. He always makes sure I am comfortable with my stay. And although there's a factory beside the house, it doesn't really bother me as they will stop all the operation around 3 PM everyday and it will be quite during the night. I also love the neighborhood! It's near the rice field and surrounded by Balinese neighbors. The street are paved, neat and easy to access. The house is near Mambal traditional market and Ubud, so it's very strategic too!",,,,

Pricewise surprising good üëç","A very beautiful villa. The interiors are very unique and give a premium feeling. The antique theme gels well and is maintained throughout. The swimming pool with a small fountain is the highlight of the villa. The common area is maintained very nicely. The only downside is the location, it is in the middle of the paddy fields. One way that makes it a beautiful location, but walking there in the evening looks unsafe. Overall I would recommend this villa, with a proper transport arrangement.","The place is incredibly gorgeous, calm and peaceful.
The housekeepers are really nice to us and quiet during the stay.
The owner is fully available for any questions or details (get taxi, questions about the villa, additional needs...) it makes it really appreciable.
I fully recommend this villa, value for money is almost unbeatable.
Rooms and bathroom quality is really pleasant. Swimming pool side is perfect to chill and share relaxing moments.
The plants make this place a lonely apart place to enjoy the stay.

The crew running the tour and cooking workshop were so welcoming, friendly and informative.
I was the only one booked so I got a complete private experience which didn't feel at all awkward.
The food was delicious and fun to prepare and the information and tour of the farm was very interesting.
Highly recommended this experience.","Loving every minute of this tour, thank you all for such an unforgettable experience üôè","Authentic and educational. My family (2 adults + 2 kids aged 5 and 3) had fun harvesting crops, fishing, meeting animals, wading in the river. Had chance to help with the cooking (making satay, grinding spices, etc).
