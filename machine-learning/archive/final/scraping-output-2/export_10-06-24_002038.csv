The hill is not very popular for foreigner, but quite famous for local people. Hidden gem! It's very superb view if good weather. But the access isn't very smooth.","Bukit Pemukuran is a scenic spot in Bali that offers a panoramic view of the island and the ocean. It is a popular destination for hikers, photographers and nature lovers who want to enjoy the fresh air and the tranquility of the place. The trail to the top is well-maintained and not too challenging, but it can get crowded during peak hours. The best time to visit is early in the morning or late in the afternoon, when the sun is not too harsh and the sky is clear. Bukit Pemukuran is a must-see for anyone who wants to experience the beauty and diversity of Bali.",you can see the view of the coast from here and there's a nice cafe. they have spacious parking area too,"Although it was not the clearest view when I got up, it is perhaps one of the best birdâ€™s eye view of East Bali. Top of Pemukuran hill overlooks Tenganan ancient village, Candidasa, Manggis and Padangbai. Access is still quiet small through the local Sibetan village."
