Some friends were visiting Asia for the first time and they really enjoyed the Indonesian food catered by the hotel. We would definitely come back here for future visits to Bali. Thank you for showing us a wonderful time!","Definitely the best resort I've stayed at in recent years. The rooms and amenities are unmatched. Very high quality of services in every aspect, especially the friendly and pleasant staff that make you feel right at home. The location is perfect for visiting the attractions of Ubud, but leaving this beautiful resort to visit other attractions is quite hard to bare 😅. We enjoyed every moment of our visit and strongly recommend it to all of our friends and family and future visitors! 😊",Me and my friend went for floating breakfast which was setup in common pool. We really loved the pool and experience but the food was not good at all. Two smoothie bowls were included but the taste was not good at all. Apart from sandwiches we didn't like anything. I really feel they should improve on the taste. It's not worth the money.,"We had an absolutely amazing time here on our honeymoon and we can not recommend this place enough. The room, dining and facilities were A+ but the best part of the experience was dealing with all the staff and management who were the most friendly and helpful people in the world...beautiful people.

They went out of their way to make him comfortable and prepared meals that weren't on the menu but were easier on the stomach, and told us when we were settling the bill that they were complimentary.

Simply unmatched warmth and hospitality. I cannot recommend Viceroy Bali enough.","Impeccable experience.  Luxury in every way. The staff is simply perfect and made the stay the most comfortable we have had. The food was delicious, cocktails at Apertif were superb and creative. If you are looking for a luxurious experience, look no further. I'd recommend to leave the kids at home though. Romance is what you should find here.","I cannot recommend Viceroy enough!! From the moment we got there the staff couldn’t do enough for us and we enjoyed every moment. The villas are beautiful and I would recommend getting one with a pool, they’re beautiful. The main pool area is also stunning with views overlooking the jungle and a lovely quiet and calm atmosphere.
The food at Viceroy was lovely and reasonably priced considering how lovely it was! Loved every moment and we can’t wait to come back!","We stayed for 9 nights for our honeymoon and every single moment was pure bliss at Viceroy. It speaks volumes that the staff enjoy working with Amanda and her team and that same friendliness was passed on to us from the restaurant teams, the bars, housekeeping and drivers/guides. It is absolute paradise and so peaceful! We had the BEST time. Thank you so much!","Luxury Luxury Luxury! I visited Viceroy Bali about a month ago and had such a great experience throughout my stay. This was the best Luxury resort in Bali that I stayed in during my time in Bali. The service was flawless from check in to check out. The staff were great, nothing was too much trouble. The resort looks out over a stunning valley with views and has fine dining restaurants on the premises. There was a wide range of facilities onsite; a good gym, brand new spa, squash court and conference room. I loved my private pool, the view was superb.

The views are breathtaking and our whole stay was so peaceful, we did not want to leave. The staff offer an exceptional service and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable during your stay.

The resort is amazing, the staff are so friendly and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was amazing. Special mention to Yogi for making us feel extra special. The rooms, food and everything about the resort is incredible. Highly recommend staying at The Kayon Valley resort","Feeling relaxed and well-fed after a great stay. Attentive and friendly staff, zen atmosphere, diverse à la carte breakfast, and a room with all necessities, including a private plunge pool! Happy hour by the communal pool is 12-3pm. Scheduled shuttled service is offered to Ubud Centre and Kayon Jungle Resort. We did the morning walk with hotel staff which was a casual way to see the surrounding area (2km walk). We stayed here for our first 2 nights in Bali, it was a great way to start the trip. Highly recommend staying and unwinding here!","Probably the best hotel I’ve stayed in ever. That includes all the 5 star hotels I’ve stayed in over the course of 5 weeks across SEA and the Indian Ocean.

The views from the hotel overlook into a lush and dense jungle in the Kayon Valley. Each room is carefully designed with super comfy beds, smart TV, and a large bathroom.

The breakfast is unreal, and if you don’t have it included in your package, upgrade asap.

Every night they have some event at their restaurant ranging from acoustic singers to local Balinese dancers.

They have a free shuttle that conveniently runs to take the guests to and from the Ubud center.

The staff is some of the friendliest I’ve come across and they’re ready to jump to help with anything you might want!"

By dessert time, we were so full to eat anything. The sweet staff prepared a birthday cake for my husband and packed the last confectionery dessert so we could eat in our hotel as we were very full.

This restaurant deserves a Michelin star for their out of the world food and serve.

I have tried all the food that I have selected on my package and there is no single food that I did not enjoy.

Strongly recommend this fine dine to everyone","This is my goto restaurant in Ubud where the food and service are consistent and of high quality.

The interior is classic and elegant.  The menu changes seasonally and the set menus are usually interesting. The food is always presented beautifully. Their wines are of good collection to pair with the food. Wine by the glass is always fresh tasting.

Also have a visit to their bar. It is very nice.","This must be one if the top restaurants in the world.
If located in Europe Michelin would grant a minimum of 2 stars.

the room is of good size, clean and comfortable. the few bugs in the toilet is normal for a hotel that is surrounded by paddy fields.

The hotel breakfast is yummy too. The staff is friendly and helpful too.

There are a few restaurants within walking distance too.

I definitely recommend this hotel to everyone. personally I'll stay at manyi again without any hesitation.","Great value, surrounded by rice paddies. It’s easy to get to town on a scooter or $2 Gojek. They let us check in 4 hours early, and arranged a scooter for a great rate. Bagus sekali.","1. Is very far from the center - about 10 mins drive , and multiply that every time you want to dine or shopping or activities to do .
2. Smells horrible because of the rice fields being full of spoiled water .
3. Gecko’s everywhere, the noise they’re making is very strong
4. Half of my family had to leave because of the poor conditions in the villa, ruining our vacation .
5. £40 , almost 1.000.000 IR got stollen from my husband’s wallet , by the cleaning staff, and the villa manger didn’t even bother to apologise but defended her staff.
6. Pool was always cold , both the public and the private one .
7. Restaurant prices well above average, and the food was rubbish!

Please don’t even try to book this villa /accomodation , it will ruin your holiday , we found much cheaper and better accommodations in the center of Ubud for this price !

Hope you guys at Many Village get to improve !!","Unfortunately i saw way too many bugs in this place. The staff was very nice and accommodating. Its a bit out of the way, the price was nice at first glance but there’s cons and reality of living in the rice patty field. I appreciated the staff letting me know the grass has been trimmed so its not green, more like yellow and it was Ok for me. It was serene, quiet, in nature. They gave me an upgraded room upstairs. The pool is gorgeous and set right on the patty. The bathroom had 2 large windows of the field plus the bathroom was gorgeous.

The cons: there were sooooo many ants. When i first arrived without touching the sheets, i noticed 10 ants on the bed. They helped change the sheets. Then throughout the night they were just on my bed. I kept squashing them. No food in the room, bug shields down. Still i found them on the floor all over the bathroom, on the counter, in the bed, on the pillow, on the sheets, inside my bags. I think they need pest control. Eventually i just accepted it as part of living in nature. But i would find them crawling on my body in bed. 😬Eventually i stayed 5 nights but everynight the bugs got worst and worst. The last night i left 1 of my cough drop in my bag and it infested the entire bag swarming with more ants. The water heater went out x3 in my stay and they promptly fixed it. I took several cold showers.. sometimes I don’t mind. They do not provide room service and frankly it will attract way too many bugs. Old school lock and key. I still give it 3 stars but the reality is they need pest control. The aircon wasnt strong enough for the room size. I was sweating at night and they provided an extra fan. Its march and its 85 degrees outside.","We liked the rice terrace surrounding the hotel.
The location is not too close to Ubud center but also not too far.
The way the Hotel room is designed was great. we got to see a the rice terrace from any angle.

This property need a deep cleaning. The rooms are smelly and dirty. You see ants and spiders everywhere, which to some level is expected from a hotel located in middle of rice terrace, but in this hotel no effort being made to control it.
The room might look clean in the first sight, but behind the curtain, under the bed and around the corners are mess!
Some stuff were helpful, but few times we got really annoyed with their service. We were a family of 3 with a 1.5 year baby and there was no enough towels in the room. upon request, they kept delaying or refused us (they even ask us to use the pool towels for our baby which I found disrespectful). until I personally went to the receptionist and explained that we are officially 3 people but there are towels for 2 people and after few negotiations they eventually gave us the extra towels."

From the moment you drive down the well-manicured driveway, the atmosphere was super peaceful and quiet, exactly what we wanted.
Food was outstanding, as was the service. The detail in the restaurant is on another level than what you would be used to in Bali. Worth a visit for a special occasion.",We enjoyed our dinner. The staff was very attentive. The food was impeccable. I had to travel 24 hours to experience boneless whole fish. They have set a standard for whole fish.

All the art around the place also gives the huge house a very nice feel to it. Rooms aren't the best if you're close to the street side, but you get what you pay for.","You get what you paid for. The price is really cheap and the house is huge, but it lacks maintenance and everything looks old and dusty. If you don't feel comfortable  going up and down the stairs, this is not the place for you since it's 3 floors high and the steps are really big. The bathrooms were unclean and have bad smell, the bed had only one blanket that wasn't big enough to cover the whole body.

Is not close to the centre either, but you can get around walking or renting scooters in the hostel (50k per day). They don't provide breakfast, but there are some nice places around to eat or you can buy something in the supermarket.

Very disappointing!","We extended our stay 3 times here we loved it so much! The staff were so friendly, breakfast was delicious and rooms were so cozy. Only downside was that it was around 5-10mins from the centre of Ubud so best to rent a motorbike to travel back and forth.","Amaya Cottages was my home away from home for a couple of weeks- I stayed in a reasonably large villa featuring untainted views of the rice fields, a private outdoor kitchen and patio area, and a well laid out bathroom. The owners were kind and helpful, breakfast was served on time and prepared with care (thank you for the dragon fruit juice!), and my room was cleaned every two days to high standards. There was a water dispenser, a fridge and a kettle in the room which you don't find very often for this price range. Highlight was the tucked away pool and poolside with loungers, perfect to connect with other guests and chill after work. I even had dragonflies as swimming partners, which I never had staying in the center of Ubud- so sweet! Amenities nearby are good also- a nice selection of warungs and restaurants are available on foot, and Grab delivers to the area no problem if you don't fancy walking. Overall, a recommended host for short to mid-term stays.","Glad to have stayed here in our first time in Bali. Peaceful, tranquil, relaxing. I never could have imagined that i would be staying at a place in the middle of a rice field. A few tens of meters walk from the main road (no direct access by four-wheeled vehicles) makes the place even more charming. Staff are nice, place is clean. Highly recommended."

New, with big rooms, clean, and a great environment. The staff is very supportive and kind.

I would just like to suggest a bottle of water in the room and some furniture on the terrace to enjoy the garden views.

Thanks!","The rooms are spacious and comfortable, amazing view from 2 floor. Black out curtains  help to sleep in the morning. Good breakfast option with noodles, omelette, fruits and fresh juices. They can prepare you a bath with flowers which might be a bit cold, about 20/22 degrees. Located a bit out of the city center, but reachable by taxi (10 minutes). Friendly people on reseption!","+Rooms are spacious but the bathroom is the big sell. Huge tub, nice shampoos, comfy bed, modern  closet space. Super clean. Quiet area, 5 min to center ubud.

- Breakfast was scrambled eggs, fruit and dark coffee, but hard toast rock solid could not eat it.
- Not sure why they build the building not facing rice fields? My lower room 1/2  faced parking lot, a waste.","Room wasn’t ready for check-in due to late check-out of previous guests. Owner was explaining it to me in WhatsApp but late check-out should be allowed to guests only if there is no booking after him. It is not a problem of any of the guests but a problem with hotel management. As a result cleaning was super fast. I came in and towels were wet. Tea table had footprints of wet glasses.
On top of it:
- Air conditioner wasn’t working
- Toilet cover seat is extremely old and in black dirty stains (needs replacement)","Beautiful view. Away from city (around 4.5 kms), motorbikes on rent provided by owner. Rooms on ground floor can have bugs."

You can use the kitchen at the ground floor, staff are very friendly. Highly recommended!!! Thanks Carlos for the great hospitality","Peaceful and quiet but it is also unfinished. Breakfast and room cleaned daily by the most lovely lady. The pool was great to have but it needed a small fridge in each room so you can put water/drinks in there and not have to run down stairs.  Pool towels would also have been a good idea. In any case, I enjoyed my stay.","Ubud Indah Inn was such a beautiful place to stay! Being somewhere thousands of miles away from my home, family, and friends, I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay! It quickly became my Bali home and I cannot wait to come back! 24hour staff, delicious & nutritious breakfast, beautiful bedroom and bathroom with a balcony on 2nd floor, bottom bedrooms have patio as well and is right in front of the pool. I spent every morning in the pool and enjoyed my time there so much! The staff was so kind and helpful! I loved everything about this experience! I hope to be back very soon!","Expectation and reality 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ myself and family booked this villa for our get together, on our way we couldn't find the villa. Called and called , WhatsApp,  text msg, and all no answer whatsoever , The people we booked the villa from ""forgot"" to inform us  about the villa have changed name to tantra , and when they finally msg me back ,they told she/he doesn't ""play"" with their phone because they was out when we tried to reach them about where exactly the villa located! what??!!!

It is a family run business and they are such lovely people, they obviously enjoy what they do. All restaurants around also charge service fees and other hidden costs that don't show on the menu but these guys are beyond and above everyone else.

The food they make is not only good which makes for a second visit warranted but the value that they charge makes this restaurant stand head and shoulders above everyone else around.

Would highly recommend as someone who's been to this restaurant several times and would most likely visit again 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼

The only criticism I would have is that there ought to be more food options in the menu, but I digress, the food they have is top notch and of high quality, none of that processed stuff like in the western restaurants, when you're coming to this restaurant, you're eating good quality and healthy food at low price, so eating here is a win-win","The Poke Bowls are amazing. Good portion, affordable price and fresh.
The environment is great and the stuff is very friendly.
If you want to eat healthy food I recommend this place 100%.","Visited September 2023. Excellent location amidst the rice fields, just a short walk from where we were staying. Beautiful spot to enjoy your evening meal. The staff were so friendly and happy each time, whether we were dining or just walking past. The food was beautiful and so cheap. Prepared fresh, cooked fresh and presented well with a smile, always. Loved eating here. Thank you so much for your friendship and hospitality.","Cozy, little oasis just a short distance from the busy city centre. The menu presents just a few selected items, but all you need for a balanced and healthy meal. Everything is made on the spot from the freshest ingredients, and prices are more than affordable! I loved the iced cappuccino too! The atmosphere is so relaxing, I came back two days in a row! Simply lovely ","We had one of the best dinners in Ubud. The price is so affordable (that makes you feel all other restaurants are overpriced). The amount of food was also huge. I was already full, but the Green Pancake was so tempting so I ordered it (greatest decision on that day).

When I said the coke I drank was bubble less (didnt have much gas), he immediately replaced with a new bottle. I was not used to that service anywhere in Asia, but the owner was so nice and helpful. Definitely come back."

The BEST!!   Thank you for amazing memories.","This is one of my favourite cocktail bars in Ubud! Pinstripe is a must visit bar that is great to visit solo or with a group of friends. They have a huge range of premium spirits, if you are into tequila, gin or whiskeys, this place has the biggest range in Ubud.

The cocktails are really inventive and aesthetic. Personally I love the Mezcal one with the peacock feather, it is delicious and the flavours are balanced perfectly.

The atmosphere is cosy yet it’s a large space with an indoor and outside terrace with jungle views. Perfect place to sit of an afternoon with cocktails or wine and then move inside for the lively atmosphere at night time.

This bar is really unique and I recommend to all my friends visiting Bali to make sure they don’t miss out on visiting!",Highly recommend pinstripe bar. The best cocktails on the island. My personal favorite is The artist! So delicious. We had a great time here and service is amazing. Must must visit when in Ubud. 10/10!!,"We started our degustation at the bar with our complimentary cocktail served with 3 different amuse bouche.
The atmosphere is lovely. We felt taken back to the 1930s
Make sure to get early to your restaurant reservation so you can enjoy an aperitif here.","Coming here just for the vibes, not expecting the foods and sides are so delicious.

As for main dishes- the grilled pumpkin and chicken dishes are great. You really you can't go wrong here as every dish I've tried has been delicious. Soothing teas and fresh squeezed juices. Picturesque setting overlooking the rice fields. To top it all off, it is family owned by a lovely couple who provides excellent service. Makes it so easy to come back every time.","Great Ayurvedic menu, they really know how to cook Indian vegetarian/vegan food. I had the vegetable curry, it was really tasty and clean(I mean not oily at all). I will definitely Come  back to try the vegan risotto or the Ming bean curry.",Delecious fresh food. Four of us came and only one person was cooking so the wait was quite a while but it was worth it. Great vegetarian options and it is inbetween the rice fields so a great vibe.,"Absolute SOUL FOOD!

The owner is rude and a racist!

1) His AC was not cooling the room and as there is no fan the room was extremely stuffy. I raised the issue once while checking in and once more in the night.

2) He refused to accept there was a problem, gave no solution to the problem(of course) and asked me to check for other stays. This was around 10 pm in the night and it was raining outside

3) I decided to adjust and stay back for the night and told him the same. His response, that I should move out or “promise” to not complain anymore.

4) He also passed a racist comment on me.

Asking a solo woman traveler to move out in the middle of the night and rains while demanding money is not the right way to solve a problem. All he had to do was be nice and understand the problem.

My worst stay in all of Indonesia!","Excellent accommodation among rice fields.  The views from the terrace are simply wonderful.  The rooms are of high quality.  But the best thing is the owner’s family, they are excellent, very nice people, always ready to help.","My top 1 place to visit Ubud. Peaceful, rice field view, less noisy then all places i stayed before. Feels like home far away from my Home","This lovely homestay is close to Ubud Center by scooter.
