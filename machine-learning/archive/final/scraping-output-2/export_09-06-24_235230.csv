Maybe that's what I can describe about this beautiful waterfall 😊 To get there, you have to walk down about 800ish stairs. But along the walk, the scenery is breathtaking (well, its literally breath-taking tho after that stairs 😁) and you might passed some coffee trees.

The stairs are pretty easy to manage, but be careful if you go there after the rain. Might be slippery. No tickets, just 5K fee for parking when I was there. No people - which is 👌🏽. The area is so chilly, laid back, with no reception (oh-so yes!) But the toilet is indeed need some ""care"" (I forgot to take the pic).

And the waterfall, oh, its like an oasis after a long steps 😍 So beautiful with 2 falls, and big rocky river at the end of it. The water is so clean and refreshing. With not much visitors, you can really sink yourself in the middle of the sound of the waterfall in the serene jungle. So peaceful.

And yeap, prepare yourself again to walk up that 800ish stairs to go back 😁",Pleasant drive with spectacular views at the bottom.  Nobody else around at 12:00.  Bring water due to uphill stair climb of over 800 steps,"Nobody was there at 2 pm. Water is super clear. Although, there was an abandoned toilet just in front, which makes no sense to exist. On the way are durian trees, banana trees, coffee, etc.","The entrance is nestled off tho the side in this tiny mountain village. You do need to buy a ticket from the little store opposite the trail head (5k). There are steps the whole way, (a lot of em!) nearly all with a handrail. They can be slippery.  But the waterfall is a great reward and we’ll worth the hike back up the steps. Be prepared to sweat!",Little bit far from south Bali but I really enjoyed drive up there. Last part was a bit steep and narrow road for car but great view you can see. Not big waterfall but no entrance fee so nothing complain. Donation box is there if you appreciate.
