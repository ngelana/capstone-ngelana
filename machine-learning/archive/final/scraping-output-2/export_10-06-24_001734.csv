Host gave us such a tasty dinner and breakfast, went out of his way to get me bu bur for breakfast from the local market from my request. Really comfy bed, no mosquitos (i have no idea how becuase its in the middle of pretty bamboo jungle) Gorgeous surroundings and super interesting if you want to learn about working with bamboo or love salak fruit.
Thankyou for having us!","Highly recommended!

My family of 6 with kids stayed for a night last December 2023 and we ended extending for another night.

Rooms are basic. Without aircon and no tv. It was a breezy day and natural cooling.
It was quite and peaceful. Natural village atmosphere and homey hospitality by the host.

We personally thank you for hosting us during the stay.

We definitely will come back again.

Matur Suksma üôè",I stayed here over Nyepi which was incredibly special. The bamboo house is a stunning piece of art and engineering and I will absolutely return one day. We were very well taken care of by Putu and his lovey family the hospitality was top notch. Thank you so much üôè,"Should be a quick night on the way but conclues on a Really good 3days stay at the bamboo house, the place is perfect, quite and peacefull, nice point of view around and so much cooler at night with the altitude. Thanks Putu and your family really appreciate the proximity, felt like being part of it and not just staying in a ind√©pendant room of an ¬´¬†hotel¬†¬ª. Highly recommend few nights there to see an other face of Bali less touristic !","We first booked 2 nights, but we loved it so much that we doubled our stay! It is truly amazing. So calm, so green, extremely beautiful build and the owners are simply amazing. They are really sweet and helped us a lot with transport.

I can only recommend!"
