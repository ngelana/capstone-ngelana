The room smelled moldy and the therapist was not putting any efforts at all and she even ended the session with 10 minutes early without any notice.,"We had breakfast there twice after a lovely yoga class.

I came here for a morning swim around 9 am. I saw some colorful fish and some sculptures. I did not see more than that, no turtles or so, and some coral in a bit of a bad shape. Super sad, I saw plastic in the ocean and trash around.

As a first impression, I was sad to see such an incredible amount of boats parked in the sand (plus 14 boats in the water) and barely any free space to walk and enjoy the beach as a natural space for recreation. It is overcrowded with businesses almost all the way to the water or at least that is how it felt to me. Finding an exit or entrance to the street is a bit hard (at least as a first time visitor).

There were not too many tourists, maybe around 20 people besides me. A group from Korea is maybe (8), some older people (7),  and four other people, a couple and two sets of friends.

The annoying part is once you are on a walk on the sand every single business tries to lure you into their restaurant...every ambulant vendor talks to you as well.

I know this is how the locals make money, but I wish it was more chill and you could be left alone. I wish they were attracted customers by having a clean nice space, delicious food, good reviews online and other marketing tactics, not overusing spaces and plastics and yelling or talking to you directly as you pass by.

I imagined having a calm stroll and peaceful morning work out at the beach... wrong expectation.

I would say support the businesses if you can, be patient, spend most of the time in the water if you want to be left alone, or come when businesses are closed (maybe early in the morning?)

On the other hand, even though there are no lifeguards you might be well observed at all times by locals.

I imagined this place to be a true natural gem by some snorkeling articles I read, but I wonder if it still is or is endangered.","Always fabulous snorkelling.
It's annoying that you do have to pay for a bed to sit on as the beach has no where to sit. Hard to walk along as it's all pebbles and boats on shore.","Best Spot, but be careful of scam ^^ not exactly scam but we rent some equipment and they gave us faulty one and we need to pay to buy them a new one~~ paid 500k to locals for a boat and equipments for 3 person (2spot snorkeling). Better book with actual snorkeling agent so you can get documentation.",Great snorkeling spot,Nice place

what really sets joli's apart is the atmosphere. the owners and staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming, making you feel more like you're visiting old friends than dining out. add live music to the mix on weekends, and you've got the perfect spot for a relaxed and enjoyable evening. and let's not forget the coffee! they recently started serving fantastic brews, making joli's the ideal place to unwind with a stunning view and a perfect cup in hand. if you're searching for a must-visit in amed, look no further than joli's best view restaurant.","Nice view and atmosphere.

The food is ordinary, I can’t say that the dish I chose was very tasty, rather ok.  I ordered curry fish and beer, after I had dinner and was admiring the sunset, a girl came up and asked me to vacate my seat since I wasn’t ordering it anymore and they wanted to put another customer in my place!

Highly Recommended.","When I arrived at the place, I thought it was so beautiful and relaxing! Also a nice location close to Jemeluk Bay for snorkeling & diving. But unfortunately the first impression didn’t last and the negative aspects outweigh for me personally the positive ones.

The dorms are bad. It’s poorly isolated, so it gets super hot, the beds have no curtains, no bed light, so you have to wake up everybody if you arrive late and you have to search something. 0 privacy and intimacy. Besides that a dude had intercourse in one of the hostel beds and the hostel beds aren’t very stable, so it swings with all the movements you make. You get devoured by mosquitoes, no mosquito nets and since there are holes everywhere, they get in anyway. Then, there were even mice (!) in the room. One of the dudes had one in his suitcase the next morning, that was really disgusting and isn’t very sanitary… let’s not speak about the toilets or the showers…
Then the wifi never works (so if you need to work online, forget it, you can barely check your emails).
It’s so overpriced. The food is around 90k even though you can have anywhere else good food for half of that. Rental of snorkeling and diving stuff as well - 150k and just at the beach you can get it for 30k a day.

Now let’s come to the worst part for me: the staff. They were quite rude and narrow-minded but weirdly the dude that had intercourse in the dorm was allowed to stay, even though they announced he’d be thrown out. The atmosphere is horrible, there is no community or a good vibe whatsoever - which is the most important part in a good hostel. The best you’ll get from the staff will be a fake smile that is obviously a fake smile which will make you feel even less welcome and appreciated.

All in all, in terms of location and looks, the place definitely has potential, but the huts have to be reworked and modified and the staff should change entirely and they should reflect on the image they give to others and reflect on what vibe and values they want to embody.

Little advice: if you’re kind to your customers and also people from outside e.g. friends and acquaintances, maybe this would create a nice vibe and community and inspire the others to stay as well. So far you only inspired people to leave.","I booked for two nights in a dormitory, the price is already very expensive, $11 for one night, you'll find an army of ants in the communal showers. Then there are the mice that wander between the walls of the room, and you can use your light on them to find mouse droppings.
What's more, the service is not at all commercial I asked for a Snorkel and mask rental and they charged me the price for a day (150k) when there was only 3 hours left before sunset.
If you're looking for a cheap place to sleep, I strongly advise against it. You can find a private room for less and without ants and mice, and if you're a smoker, don't come because you'll be excluded from the parking lot to smoke your cigarette.
You won't find the friendly hostel atmosphere that's so absent from this establishment either."

We just left the hotel and talked to the management but I did not have the feeling that they understood the problem or will do anything about it.

The pool has dangerous bacteria in it, most likely due to a lack of maintenence. We stayed for 3 nights and never saw anyone checking the chemical values etc.

Our son got the bacterial disease ""whirlpool dermatitis"" and another family from the US / Singapore experienced the same with their child. Hence, it is not from a pool of an earlier hotel. Children are more likely to be affected by the bacteria, so adults might be lucky.

The reason is an imbalance in chemicals (not enough chlorine etc.), poor hygiene in the filter system and too high water temperature. To solve it I read that all the water would need to be exchanged, the filter etc. needs cleaning and the new one water needs proper treatment. This is unlikely to happen. As long as the issue has not been addressed do not use the pool or avoid the hotel.

We are really disappointed and our son has heavy pain now when in contact with water etc., so he cannot swim or snorkel for the next days. If a western standard hotel has a pool it has to be maintained in a way that nobody gets sick. Period.

Furthermore, the motorbike for rent was not in a good condition. The tires were really old and the suspension was heavily damaged.

Other than that friendliness of some part of the staff as well as the breakfast need some improvement.

Without the pool issue I would give 3 to 4 stars, but having the pool in mind the 2 stars are really generous.","I stayed here 2 nights, the place is modern and elegant. The rooms (mine was a Suite, which is not the biggest) are clean and big, with AC and big bathrooms.
The outdoor is great and there is also a terrace with a beautiful view.

The only side note is about breakfast.
It’s not that full and, if you order banana pancakes and you want some bread aside as the other dishes, they make you pay 20K for it. So pay attention. I suggest to serve and abundant portion.

The staff is kind and professional.

I absolutely recommend this place!","Here was so so clean!
And staffs were so kind.
Beach was front of hotel(2min), you can anywhere.
If i stay again in amed, i will still stay here.","Great budget hotel.    The staff is super friendly and the beach is just 2 minutes away walking.

The staff was kind and helpful, especially Mbak Wayang. breakfast was basic but that’s what we expected based on other reviews.

From this hotel, We walked to the very end Jemeluk bay. This was the best snorkeling site. It’s about a 10 minute walk, which was just in front of a small Balinese temple.

The pool was nice, but they could probably use less chemicals. The only awkward amenity (deluxe sea view room) was the shower within the tub. So if you Have mobility issues, be aware of this."

She wouldn't understand I had a food poisoning and stand I had a hangover, which is the last thing you want to hear when you are vomiting 10 liters of water during all the night.

Fisrtly she was mad because I came to ask in emergency water at midnight because she would not have told me that there was a water fountain upstairs and I ran out of my personal water.

Hence she doesn't understand that when you work in Hospitality it's sometimes a 24/7 job, and that international tourism faces bacterias and virus we don't have in our origin country.

I have been in other places for this budget that were way better value!!

The bedroom was very humid and she didn't wanted me to do a late check out after my awful night. My friend had to bargain and pay 100k for 3 hours.

Best time on sunset time, you can enjoy the food even able to swim/snorkeling in front of the restaurant.","We found this fabulous warung on the beach our first day and we've been back every day since! They have authentic Balinese dishes which are delicious, would recommend the grilled prawns, the curries, the fish in banana leaf... All yummy. Met Ketut today, one of the chefs and she was so friendly.","A nice semi out door restaurant on the Amed coast, with a great view of the open sea, and boats passing by carrying groups of divers.

Stopped by for lunch while touring the Karangasem area, ordered Nasi Campur and a Fresh Coconut, but only managed to take a picture of their freshly fried Calamari.

Overall great experience. Plenty of parking for scooters and cars up front.","People were friendly and nice, we had grilled mahi mahi, it took about an hour but  worth it. Dining at the quiet beach was really nice and peaceful."

We then ordered the duck betutu  1 day in advance. Slow-cooked the full day in banana leaves, it was definitely one of the best meals we had in Bali. I recommend it without hesitation!","I have been there few times as it is the closest restaurant from dharma hostel. And stronger wifi of all the other restaurants around.

Food is awesome.
I recommend the nasi campur and the cordon Bleu.
I try also the Balinese crepes with coconut sugar inside. I will have it every time I can now
Feel full after that","This is the best warung in Amed, the fish is  100% fresh. Cute family running the restaurant, bless them!","Amazing food here. One of the best food that I ate in Bali. Fish is so so good, that’s why we ate twice with my family. You won’t regret","Awesome nasi goreng with ton of chips, great prize for a big pile of really tasty food, also nice ice tea that helped from the heat. Definitely will go there again.

No view of the mountain and even we booked for the family room with ocean view but there is no ocean view at all (there is tree and covering the view).

The service is horrible, at least that was our impression when we were arrive. There is some misunderstanding, but my condition at that time I was having accident, and instead of take care of me, they are focusing on the misunderstanding problem (we were mistakenly put 2 adult and booked a family room with 1 king bed and 2 single bed, but when we arrived with the kids they were complaining a lot. I dont mind to pay more, but the way they complained was really offensive).

The family room is spacious enough, but dusty and the shower room is too open and the water flow is very slow. The bed doesn’t smell good also the room overall mildew smell.

Overall, unless you want to be alone after a breakup or don't really feel like enjoying your vacation, it's better to checkother places. There are lots of options with better prices, location and services.","The spacious bungalow was perfect for our family of 4. The restaurant was on the beach and had quick service. We enjoyed yummy fruit lassis and fruit juices with our meals. We had a variety of meals and all were good and fresh. We tried the dadar gulung, Indonesian pancake as well as an arak cocktail too. We would eat here again if we were here longer.","We loved our time here! The location couldn’t be better, fantastic snorkelling right in front of the property. Breakfast was good, morning tea/coffee outside the bedroom was lovely. Staff are kind and attentive. The rooms were some of the best we had throughout our time in Bali for our budget. Clean, lots of drinking water, nice deck for sitting. There’s a warung up on the hill that does karaoke at night so it’s a little loud but it never bothered us.","A bit difficult to find first, but if you follow the signs and just keep walking amongst the villas you will arrive to the beautiful beach front restaurant. Everything I've ordered in this place for the past three days has been truly delicious. They also have beach chairs if you want to have some shade when snorkeling the reef but please make a purchase from the restaurant. They are happy to serve you at their beach chairs too. If you're feeling a bit under the weather try their traditional cold Balinese drinks! Will miss this little corner of the world.",The beachfront bungalow we stayed is right next to the beachfront restaurant. Marvelous garden landscaping + fantastic ocean view. It’s the second time we stay here with the same room at Blue Star Bungalow and Cafe (breakfast included!). Their coconut and banana pancake and the fresh fruits salad are the best I’ve ever had. Noodle vegetable soup + special request with scramble eggs on top that’s no where else  you would get better! The grilled mixed seafood platter is so fresh and tasty. We couldn’t wait to finish our first order to place the 2nd order! Super 👍👍

Juices and food are great.
Spinach crepe was actually quite filling. Smoothie bowls are too cold but easily solutioned given the heat.
You can order breakfast food even for lunch. Juices were really good too.","Arrived when the kitchen was closing today (6pm daily) although they were kind enough to let me order to take away.   I ordered the vegan burrito and it did not disappoint!   10/10!   The bean, rice, salsa & nutritional yeast filling was absolutely delicious.  Incredibly well seasoned with a perfect texture.  The burrito was wrapped compactly and was warm and crispy on all sides..  The tortilla was homemade and very fresh!  The side salad was super fresh with a very tasty dressing.   Can't wait to go back tomorrow to try the vegan nachos.  Also, to mention that they made a point to ask/reconfirm that I wanted the vegan burrito and not the regular which I appreciated very much.  They clearly take peoples dietary choices/allergies seriously here.  Highly recommend!","A nice change from standard fare, with a nicely carried menu. I really enjoyed the breakfast burrito, feta salad, and the protein plate - packed with goodies.  They make coffees a few ways, all good, but getting a french press just feels like home again.

A slight letdown was the Rossi - excellent flavor and edges but overly soggy in the middle. Would still do it again, maybe to share though.","I had cappuccio and potato something (check the photo) the cappuccino was okay for me, a bit hot maybe if the Barista make a perfect tempreture the coffee taste is more bright. The meal is good, 1st time i ate this kinda food. Tasty. Thanks","Adorable little café with a great view. We had a DELICIOUS, breakfast (hungry vegetarian breakfast). The bread with the butter was to die for. Additionally, we ordered the feta green salad which was fantastic. The food is definitely affordable, and the staff is super friendly."

The food is good and staff and owners very friendly and helpful. Rooms are spacious.,"Superb place, you can just snorkeling in front of the bungalows. The coral is stunning 🤩 and so close to the shore. Morning swim before 8 pm is the best time after you wait for the sunrise around 6.

But for the accomodation just a so-so. They didn't clean your room daily, there's no hot water. No toiletries or towel provided. Bring your own please. Yet, the AC is cold enough. But considering thier price for the bungalows in front of the beach, its still a great deal.

You can order breakfast or other meal for lunch or dinner from their kitchen. If you order omelet, maybe you can ask for a separate salt for it. It's too salty when i ordered.","Whenever I'm in Amed, this place is my go-to spot, whether it's for a week-long stay or just a day visit to enjoy some free diving and snorkeling. The rooms might not be top-notch, but considering the budget-friendly price, you really can't expect more. Waking up to the beach view right outside your door is a treat. The snorkeling site is conveniently located just in front of the property. While the food could use some improvement, the staff members are wonderfully friendly and kind.","Stayed 1 night and it was enough. Only positive about this place is the location right on the beach. The staff have no idea how to deal with customers they don't even pretend to care. The bed was a piece of solid high density foam and was like sleeping on a rock, the AC was barely working. We paid extra for breakfast, a  'omelet' that was disgusting and burnt. We had to buy breakfast next door which was very good. The contrast between the place next door and this joint is 100%. They simply do not remotely care. I didn't bother taking photos but the photos posted are clearly very old. NOBODY was eating there, the 'resto' was a rubbish tip.  Stay elsewhere.","Great stay right on the Beach, decent prices but nothing more than basic needs with AC. Huge glass doors facing the ocean with waves sound all night for great sleeping. Waking up in the morning with the sunrise in bed or closed the Curtains for late morning awakening.
The only things that are missing are the kettle, coffee/tea in the room."

The aircon doesn’t keep up with the size of the room and the bathroom area could use a decent clean. Other than those things we found it comfortable and the bedding very clean and nice. The food from the restaurant is ok and the included breakfast very basic. The location being on the beach with a nice clean pool makes up for everything else.,"I stayed 2 nights at the room no.3 ( beach view )
The location is perfect front of the beach,
But the room looks old, the bed not comfortable, the water shower are broken (they should fix), the towels looks old, the aircon its not cold enough.","Staff were very friendly and happy to help even later in the night. The room was not at all mosquito proof, with the outdoor bathroom door unable to close without a 2 inch gap. However, mosquito nets were provided which were mostly sufficient. Aside from that, totally perfect, amazing view and delicious breakfast. Walk straight onto an okay swimming beach or 7 minutes down the beach to an incredible snorkeling area.","I am so sorry to write a bad review when the staff are so wonderful but having recently stayed at the Travisi Villas I do feel it necessary to warn other travellers.

I read previous reviews, which were mixed, but erred on the side of very good (8.5 on booking, 4 on Google) and booked 2 nights here.

The location is excellent for snorkelling, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Everything else though, is worrying to the degree that if this were in another country, the hotel would be closed by health and safety.

Our room was atrocious. There were bugs in the bed, the bathroom was so poorly lit (clearly with good reason) that is was hard to see quite how awful and filthy it was.

The patio door was broken, my husband fixed it enough to secure it. The bathroom door was completely busted and the opening so small it was difficult to get through. When ‘closed’ there was a three inch gap which let both the the insects and the horrific smell through to the bedroom.

No side tables, no lamps, very old furniture set far away from the bed and walls, my thinking is due to woodworm/termites/bed bugs.

We did not unpack our cases but made the mistake of leaving one of them open which i needed to completely empty when we left to shake out all clothing because it was swarming with tiny ants, no exaggeration, literally swarming.

Towels were threadbare and stained and the bathroom complete defies belief. We have travelled extensively and do not have any illusions about accommodation, particularly in south east Asia, but I can hand on heart say that the Villa (no.4) that we stayed in should be condemned. There is water percolating through the tiles in the retaining wall against the road in the bathroom so the floor is permanently wet in the bathroom. The toilet itself is sitting in a pool or brown water at its base.

The beach front area was very pleasant, but the pool was both murky due to a lack of cleaning and had lots and lots of broken tiles in both the children’s area and the main pool, the edges of the broken tiles were extremely sharp with lots of tiles on the steps broken, it’s a very dangerous situation. These broken and missing tiles are also a breeding ground for bacteria.

I left the hotel feeling thoroughly filthy"
