Abang, Kabupaten Karangasem, Bali 80852, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=4253306309848114082,OPERATIONAL,+62 852-9816-1172,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.6,846,,"It's a serene and peacful place. Not so crowded You have to walk for 15 minutes, almost 1 km, to reach up to the point. It's a steep hike. Another option is to go by 4x4 car, which costs 50k idr for to and fro journey, which is time saving. The condition of the 4x4 car is awful they were outdated and not at all comfortable","Lahangan Sweet is another gem in Bali that I'd easily give five stars. Just a heads-up, you'll need to decide between paying 50,000 IDR for a jeep ride up the mountain or bracing yourself for a steep 1km walk. Both have their own thrills, but the jeep ride can add a bit of comfort to your adventure.

There's also an entrance fee to consider once you get there. A little advice: check the weather before you go. The clouds can be a bit of a downer, especially if you've traveled a long way to get there. This is particularly true during the rainy season.

Despite the clouds, we felt the visit was totally worth it. But if we were to do it again, we might plan it differently, maybe timing it better with the weather or preparing for the climb a bit more. All in part of the adventure, right?","Beautiful spot well worth the difficult road trek to visit. This place is pretty amazing.  The views are breathtaking, and it's immaculately kept","This is an absolute Gem of a place hidden away from the hustle & bustle of Instagrammers clamoring for pictures at the Lempuyang temple. A very scenic spot to capture the sunrise, as well as an uninterrupted view of the majestic Mount Agung. Although the entrance fee of 50k and jeep charges of 50k p.p to the top ( you may choose to trek the appx. 10 mins hike from the car parking lot)  may appear relatively high, you can spend an hour up there enjoying the peace and the breathtaking views. Just a 10 mins drive from the gateway of  heaven temple. Totally worth the visit.","A good alternative to visiting the temple for sunrise. The views are good from here, with cleared trees allowing nice sight of the volcano. However an entrance fee of 50,000 is far too high, unless you are really into Instagram photos.

Despite being a slight rip off, I'd still recommend coming to this hill for sunrise, even if you don't enter as the view is very nice."

Very scenic and friendly staff ... There is a short 4x4 trip on bad roads to the peak but the view from here is worth the trouble... Also, you have great places to click pics.... You can actually skip Lempuyang and directly come here... Highly recommended","Make sure to reach the peak before sunrise to marvel at the beauty of Mount Agung kissed by the first light üåÑ

The road leading to the place is narrow and winding, but well-maintained (no major potholes). Cars won't have a problem. After reaching the parking area, you need to either walk up for 15 minutes, rent a motorbike taxi, or a jeep.

The entrance ticket is 25k for locals, 40k for domestic tourists, and 60k for foreign tourists.","Absolutely amazing views and no lines to take pictures. This is a newer location and doesn‚Äôt have a ton of tourism yet but they are building a gate, like The Gate of Heaven here so it will probably get more popular soon. Great experience with a lot of great spots for pictures.","Not the easiest route to reach and not guaranteed if you could see the view due to clouds‚Ä¶ but if you do, it‚Äôs surreal! It worths all the efforts‚Ä¶ better to visit early in the morning.
Entrance 50k; transport to the top 50k (recommended as it is steep and muddy)","One of my top Balinese experiences, highly recommend.

This marker is almost at the top of the peak, access it via the photo marker nearby, via the TV towers not via the roads leading directly to this one!

There is a small tourism ticket cost for the peak.
It is 800M up the final track, most vehicles won't be allowed... 4WD drive Jeep's operate as ferries, I rode a motorcycle successfully, I did slide on both wheels coming down however!

If you ride up to at least the first stage take care, use your gears to decelerate on the descent or risk brake failure, don't do it in wet conditions.

There is a great Resto Warung near the top.
The road is pretty good by Balinese standards to the checkpoint yet it is very steep at a couple of sections....

I loved this because the valley ascent itself was amazing, lush jungle mountains surrounding, prosperous rural land and life, music, social, smiles, a beautiful land with beautiful people, rather less spoilt by modern life and no advertising or tourism other than the peak itself.

The locals have built creative and wonderful viewing platforms up the top, it is serene, beautiful and worth a long stay. I didn't get to witness Sunset yet it would be amazing to have done so then dined at the Warung nearby.

Enjoy üôèüçÄüåÑ"
