Visited this restaurant as it was recommended by a Youtuber, Mark Wiens.

It appeared to be one of my best meals in Bali.

The beef and side dishes, especially sambal (tasty chili), were cooked to perfection! The broth was so favourful! I love to mix the side dishes (mixed veg and sambal) altogether with rice, it provides a favourful and balanced taste to your taste buds.

p/s: You might be confused when you arrived at the main entrance of this restaurant, as you can‚Äôt see any tables and chairs; it doesn‚Äôt look like a typical restaurant. Just keep walking. I personally feel like entering someone‚Äôs property without invitation =)","Taste: 5/5
Atmosphere: 5/5
Parking: 4/5
Price: 5/5

This is what you really call hidden gem, not places from so wannabe tiktokers or grammers. The best meal I have tried in Bali, strong seasoning, medium spicy, average portion, combine it with cold temulawak, feels like heaven. Location is around 500m from main street, inside a common house, you might miss it.
Recommend you to visit Sangeh Monkey Forest near restaurant, smaller and cheaper compared to Ubud, less tourists.","A must try. Really worth the 1+ hour drive. Affordable, great flavour, also located in a balinese style house. Beloved by locals.","First time trying beef lawar. Very tasty seasoning. You can feel all different textures of beef from the lawar. Sweet, flaky, melt-in-your-mouth meat floss; tender meat; chewy tripe; and crunchy jelly-like skin. Strong broth as well."

Such a homey place and friendly customer services!","A true hidden gem offering authentic local cuisine. Each dish is made to order, ensuring a unique and delicious experience. The meals are not only flavorful but also reasonably priced.

The chef met with us and explained each of her recommended dishes.

We tried the Lawar Nyawan package, which includes rice, soup, and satay.","A gem of Balinesse Culinary in the Heart of Sangeh.

Sangeh is well known for its Monkey Forest,however when it comes to culinary, there is a hidden gem newly discovered called 'Lawar Nyawan' to be exact Lawar Nyawan Piring Mas which belong to Ibu Dayu and her family. We discovered this gem from youtube programs though we've been to Bali many times , so this time we make sure we visit Lawar Nyawan Piring Mas.
Location : about 200-300 M to entrance/exit of  Sangeh Monkey Forest sanctuary. Just put on your google maps its easy to be found. If you come early ,parking suppose not to be an issue. However Ibu Dayu did informed the road in front the restaurant actually a one way street so just pay attention.

Vibes: Home, yes you feel like you coming home. ibu Dayu and family will welcome you warmly ,with smile and more than just balinesse hospitality , it is a heartly hospitality. When you eat here ,all your senses is being pampered. The sounds of water from fish ponds,birds, a radio, a kitchen prepared the food, smell of balinese incensse. Its just like home.

Food : lawar nyawan or bee larvae lawar has the taste 10 out of 10 for me, having taste some of the best Bali lawar, the suna cekuh ingridients that been slow cooked for 8 hrs combined with the juicy and sweetness of honeybee larvae plus the spicness of green peppers and chillis will made your taste buds dancing happily.

Service : its a home restaurant with 5 stars service, how Ibu Dayu and family welcome you, passionate explained what they prepare for you and the way they explained the process and their product was 5 stars. We did asked for take away and they happily prepared our request and explained how to prepared it back at home.

Overall was the best bali even worldwide culinary experience for us, defo will come back sometime soon. Thank you so much Ibu Dayu and family for preserve the unique culinary traditions üôè.","Something yummy for my tummy!
A great food accompanied by a very welcoming owner.
Definitely worth a short trip from Ubud.","As a foreigner, I would say the food here is easy on the tastebud if you‚Äôre good with herb and spices! (The chopped chili was really spicy though)

It was my first experience with lawar but I am happy to say it‚Äôs the best dish I‚Äôve tried in Bali and I tried it here at Piring Mas!

The owners speak excellent English and are kind to explain each dishes. Highly recommend anyone who‚Äôs in the vicinity to drop by for lunch. We ate the chicken skewers, garden snails, and bee lawar!"

Love it!!,"Came here on July 3rd, 2018.
Lawar is traditional Balinese cuisine, and 'kuwir' means duck.
A portion of lawar (IDR 25K) is comes with lawar, rice, sate lilit, and soup.
The soup is special, you can find a duck egg and also chopped young banana trunk, something not easy to find elsewhere.
The food is delicious and would recommend this place.","Well priced, 25k include the drink. Loving the broth! Also the satay tasted so gewwwwd üëå",Famous among locals. Their food was sold out in 3 hours (8-11 am) during weekends.

Despite being a food stall rather than a restaurant, the quality of the food was outstanding. The pork skewers were cooked to perfection, with a slight char on the outside and a tender, juicy interior. The seasoning and marinade used on the meat added an extra depth of flavor, making these some of the best pork skewers I've ever had.

The staff at Sate Rai were friendly and attentive, ensuring that our dining experience was enjoyable from start to finish. The food stall itself was clean and well-maintained, adding to the overall positive experience.

I would highly recommend Sate Rai to anyone looking for delicious pork skewers in Sangeh. Whether you're a local or a tourist, this is a must-try food stall that won't disappoint.",Best pork satay in north Badung. We come back to this place frequently since years,"Read from google map review by locals that this place is the first original Sangeh pork satay. Unfortunately when we passed at noon on the way to Bediugul we found it was closed. On our way back to Ubud late afteenoon finally we saw it‚Äôs open. Turned out it opens starting 2.30 PM to late evening. Place is much cleaner than the more famous stall nearby. Tastewise - no sauce as at the more famous stall, but we prefer satay at this place better than the above mentioned Sangeh‚Äôs pork satay place. Must try if you pass Sangeh road from Denpasar, it‚Äôs on the right side of the road few hundred meters before Sangeh monkey forest.",Very good satay,Authentic taste of pork satay on Sangeh

It's true that getting to this location from the airport is quite far, it's located in the Sangeh area (very close to the monkey forest tourist spot), you need to travel around 90 minutes by car (if you use a motorbike maybe around 60 minutes) but if you go to the Sangeh area, that's fine. try stopping by at this place.

From the moment we entered their home we were treated like family. Being able to experience traditional Balinese cooking just the two of us and them in their actual home made this experience so memorable and felt authentic. This was by far our top moment from our honeymoon. We spent the whole afternoon learning about their culture and felt completely relaxed and at ease. They were such a lovely couple to be around and we spent the afternoon chatting and laughing. The food we were able to produce was delicious and probably the best food we had in Bali (even though all the food we had in Bali was fantastic) Thank you both again for your hospitality and the memories you have helped to create for us . From Becky &Craig xx,My partner and I had such a wonderful experience in our cooking class! I loved how intimate it was and how we really got to know more about Balinese culture and food and our lovely hosts! They really made us feel comfortable and like family. I would highly recommend this experience to anyone traveling in Bali. The food was incredible and sharing a meal together at the end was so special. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!,Nice way to experience the beauty and nature of Bali! Nice to learn about the culture and people of Bali! We had a great time and meat a lovely family! And euh.. don't forget you're (pink) water shoes! üòÖ,"Incredible trekking experience! Khrisna is a fun, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful guide. The trek itself isn't easy in parts so a bit of hiking experience is probably a good idea. But Khrisna will guide you through.","We have enjoy a very great experience today. A very kindness family has opened the door of their house and shared with us many things about the way of life and the mindset of their community in Bali... We have had a very nice walk in the Jungle/garden, between rice yields, in the oldest monkey forest..., a refreshing and relaxing swim in the river... What and recomendable adventure!
