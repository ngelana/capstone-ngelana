Fries were done just right and fresh and crispy.
Portions are small but prices are very cheap too.
Very small place and definitely street food but an excellent one and open late.","The food is so worth it for the price, the only downside is the long waiting list because the place is quite small but they managed to cover it with their quick service","Tender pork ribs, big size compared to the price. Crowded and easily out of stock before 8 PM. Cost less than 100K for 2.","Food 5* . The portion worth lah for the price!
Service? Don't expect fast service. Overload make the service a bit slow.

The sushis were also fresh eventhough they were in room temperature (compared to other places which are served cold but arent fresh), we tried the salmon maki, kani maki, and the california roll. From my personal preference, would be much tastier if the sushi's temperature were a little bit lower to have a cool sensation and enhance the freshness of the ingredients.

From the serving point, it was okay considering the cutleries and ""plates & bowls"" were all disposables, portioned soy sauce, and one time Ocha refill. If they had solid plates and bowls and available condiments on the table. The dining experience would be much better.

Price wise, they were quiet affordable considering the quality of the food. However, the cutleries and dinnerware, should've been upgraded for dine in experience to make it worth.","affordable sushi, karage, beef, teriyaki, and rice bowls. suits my non carbs diet.
place is often too warm for lunch. ‚òÄÔ∏è","This is another Yanagi from the same one in Kuta. It has a different seating concept. The food was good, and we found a new favorite: the Salmon Mentai Roll.

The downside was that only flies could come to your food, but the staff prepared candles, so it's another effort to appreciate.","Great restaurant for sushi lover
Food 4/5

Best thing about this restaurant is good price. They need to improve on drinks quality","Easily the best local sushi for value you could have asked for. The other rice menu is average but the sushi is just amazing üòã and their staff are super generous with additional sides request. My go to order sushi here are always Salmon Mentai or Tuna crunchy, and pro tip is change the cheese into avocado and it will be heavenly!!
The ambience is especially the best during sunset as you could see them from the restaurant when it sets. I'd do anything for this place if they added a Japanese rice Option I'd pay more omg!"
