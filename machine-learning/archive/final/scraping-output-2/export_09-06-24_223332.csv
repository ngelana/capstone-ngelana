The scenery was the best part - the views were stunning and kept changing beautifully throughout the day. The cool, foggy evenings turned into a magical scene with twinkling city lightsüåÉ and in the mornings we were treated to gorgeous sunrises over the hills around usüåÑ

The glamping accommodations were incredibly nice, with things like power outlets, fans, towels, a heated bathroom, and super fast wifiü´∂üèª They also provided breakfast, though the eggs were a bit too oily for my likingüò©The only real downside was all the flies, which is just something you have to expect in a mountain areaüòï

Overall, I was really impressed and left feeling completely refreshed. This glamping spot is an amazing place that I would strongly recommend to anyone looking for a unique, nature-focused getawayüëç‚ú®","Private glamping room is not worth 700k. Empty shower gel bottle left in the bathroom, I had to ask them to buy new one and they bought me a bar soap. Aircon was not working, they tried to fix it but no results. It's very hot during the day without aircon so we left at 9am after the first stay. Paid for 2 night and couldn't be bothered asking for a refund. They can keep the money. Lots of flies but understandable cause it's Kintamani. The only positive side about this place is the view. The view overlooking the village down mount batur is amazing.",Absolutely loved my stay here! The views are amazing!! The owner is very kind. Breakfast and coffee/tea included,this is going to be a whole life memory when you spend a night at,"I personally think the units for glamping with shared bathroom is better than the private glamping units. The private glamping unit is igloo-shaped units with ""love hotel"" drape and interior, and a kitten can sneak into your tent since there's a gap between the ground and the tent - don't worry it's cute.
I hope they fix the lock at the bathroom and the interior

The view is amazing.. the nyat nyat mujair for dinner is the BEST in Bali, the fireplace is great."

The location is great for the view but there are other options popping up around. You are charged 100k extra for a kid sleeping in the same bed as you, though the breakfast is very basic (fried noodles, or omelette, or pancake). WiFi is only strong near the reception and doesn't reach the pool and front room areas well.
Flies are a problem during the day, but it is probably the case everywhere in Pinggan area,  though there was a cow right under the property though.","beautiful glamping with a beautiful view.
The room should probably be air-conditioned, because this is my first glamping experience so I just found out that if the room model is like the one with transparent glass, in the morning until 4 pm it's still very hot. Having standing mirror/just mirror in the room can also be a consideration.
The service from the staff is good, very helpful. maybe the breakfast menu just needs to be improved again in terms of taste and appearance. üòä","good hotel with good view and best experience ever with good staff, very recommendedü§çü§çü§ç",The scenery extremely beautiful..

I was allowed to explore my own betas and only received help when asking. There were a lot of routes (40?) to attempt. The rock was mostly shady and extremely impressive to climb being the rim of Batur‚Äôs caldera. I‚Äôm a basic jug lover who boulders v3/4 at home but still managed a pretty crimpy 5c! The crag and routes are maintained by their family operation and the area is rented from local people. Kris also helped me with an awkward travel arrangement and dealt with everything super fast on WhatsApp - big thanks!","Terima kasih banyak Kak Kris, Kak Deva and team! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Had such a lovely time doing the rock climbing and hot springs packet~ the team are super professional, prioritze safety, brough great vibes and very responsible too! It was amazing to see how efficient they were in hosting the rock climbing and that they made sure to leave no trash behind in the site too! Definitely recommend them for anyone looking for some outdoor adventure üßóüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚õ∞üèï","Really enjoyable climbing experience! I climbed with Rama, who was helpful, experienced and always ready to accommodate for my skill level. There is a wide range of routes for climbing, many of which can be slightly modified to make them easier/harder.

The whole company is a family operation that is very respectful of the crag, the village nearby and the guests.

Highly recommend climbing with them, and I'm looking forward to checking out their bouldering gym in Ubud!","Great day out in the mountains! Kris was an all round friendly guide who is experienced and knows the crags like the back of his hand (he bolted some of the routes!) He sets ups routes based on the experience level of the climbers and gives great guidance and advice for more experienced climbers like me. Highly recommend to go with him since he knows the area well, and also if you'd like to explore a lesser known area of Bali!","the most unforgettable trip with Khris.
this climbinb point is really unique because he made all these routes by himself.
He is the only person who can guide everything with this place

This trip includes pick&drop, breakfast&lunch, rock climbing near Mt.Batur, hot spring near Batur etc.
You don‚Äôt need to prepare your gear because Khris will bring if you need.

Thanks for this kind trip and I enjoyed exciting climbing, exotic volcano views, tranquilizing hot springs."
