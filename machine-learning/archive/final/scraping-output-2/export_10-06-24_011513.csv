Breakfast is a bit lacklustre in terms of options. We paid for 2 facials which were very expensive in comparison to other places we could‚Äôve gone down the road but we wanted to support the villa and assumed with such high quality service the facial would be too.
We were moisturised 4 times and each time they would wet some tissue (I could hear the tissue leaving the tissue box) and wipe our faces down and then put a mask on us and left us alone for 30 minutes. I could‚Äôve done this in my villa myself. Expected more of a facial massage or even massaging elsewhere while we had our face mask on. But they applied the mask, left the room for 30 minutes, came back took it off and that was it.

Pure waste of money.","This resort is so nice, everything is done for the confort of the clients. We went there in december for our honeymoon and we could not be happier. The restaurant was so good and the staff incredibly nice.
The villa was soo beautiful and they made it so welcoming with the fruits the drinks and honeymoon spelled with rocks. It was magical ! Strongly recommend the SPA ! The couples massage was divine.
The pool is huge !","I'm so disheartened that our families Bali vacation got ruined by this facility!we arrived on dates books, request an extra bed and said that we was traveling with kids the lady I spoke to over the phones was all of a sudden no longer working there but I spoke to her 6days prior, the staff treated us like terrorists , everything we request was an issue.my kids got sick on the second day I called front desk at 2am no one answered I called for several hours no answer(all I wanted was ice to cool temperature since we all stuck in one bed) I paid over $500 for a disgrace of a place! The breakfast was the worst ever, honestly this is not worth it! The manager came on our hour  being there wanting us to remove our reviews like where were you the entire time we was treated like thief's? We paid hard earned money to get a mess of a vacation!
I'm honestly disgusted by this treatment!
The worst part was when she said we take the money out of the staff salary for things (are you kidding me)
The fact that we had to get massages/lunch /dinner and activities at other facilities says a lot!","The villa was very nice and with great service, a fantastic layout and large pool. The breakfast was a bit disappointing, please change the orange juice, it is awfull.... And Bali ist know for the best coffee around the world... Serving coffee from a large international brand makes me cry....","First of all place is cute , it has a lot of potential. The front staff was the worst and Al our stay sour the first night we were ready to pack our bags and go somewhere else but they wouldn't refund us.
We had a few request before arrival and none of them were met, we were given lies and excuses.my kids were forced to sleep on a sofa, the extra bed requested wasn't given and they wanted us to pay extra. Towels were dirty and full of stains daily!
Breakfast was unappealing  daily more like dinner.
I have nothing good to say but a beautiful place that has potential."

Not only did I get bitten by bed bugs, which was confirmed by a medical professional. I also when I informed the hotel did absolutely nothing. They didn‚Äôt offer me a refund, or offer to take my clothes for professional cleaning. As you know ignoring bed bugs puts all guests at risk because their ability to travel. The women are sweet at reception but unable to deal with issues, when I called the manager he said ‚Äúsorry, it is my day off‚Äù. The incompetence and inability to accept responsibility was mind boggling.

Plus the rooms are not cleaned well, I had to change too d twice for ants on my bed as well, as captured. It‚Äôs not cleaned well. I normally hate leaving bad reviews but this one was very necessary. I don‚Äôt want any travelers experiencing what I did today.","It‚Äôs a great value for money, the breakfast is definitely the highlight of our stay! However there were quite a few downsides.. On my first night i got bit by mosquitoes or some kind of other bugs, while eating outside it was more bugs than i ever experienced in Indonesia.. the AC kept making really loud noises out of nowhere, so i didn‚Äôt really get much sleep.. The road to the hotel is terrible but for a shorter stay it didn‚Äôt bother us too much.

To finish on a positive note, the staff is adorable, rooms have everything you need but the bug situation should be managed as well as broken AC‚Äôs..","Good hotel!

It has a pool and a bar area. The rooms are good with clean showers and good space. The hotel is however a bit central with a 15 minute drive to most of the tourist attractions. They do supply motorbike rental with a good price of 90000 rupiah per 24 hours!","This is a pretty good ‚Äúvalue for money‚Äù hotel. Just don‚Äôt be surprised by the terrible road which leads to it! The road is a nightmare to navigate with lots of pot holes and sharp rocks, along the road are heaps of stray dogs- do not recommend walking it.

The good parts:
- excellent buffet breakfast
- swimming pool
- friendly staff

Needs improvement:
- no hand soap provided in guest rooms ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- bath towels provided but stained and washed out, not nice to use
- spa and massage is advertised as a service but was not available at the time","The hotel it‚Äôs beautiful, have a really nice swimming pool. The breakfast is good . The staff  is really nice . Every morning the housekeeping staff clean the room amazing. The shower is really good ."

Normally we dont care if the hotel is a bit old, but this was the limit.. sooo hot in the room because the aircondition did not work fully!
when we told the lady in the reception that the aircondition did not work, and if they maybe had a fan, she just answered ‚Äúit is very hot in Bali right now‚Äù and we know because we have been in Bali for a month, but it has not been a problem anywhere else only this hotel
The location is bad because the road is scary to walk, very busy and no sidewalk
The female receptionist was so rude and childish
Would not waste the time to go there, lucky and happy that we only booked 2 nights
Also a lot of russians stay here","Very good location, even better facilities and on top of all very affordable prices. The staff was very helpful as well. Clean everyone. Yes, you can tell the hotel is a bit old but that ok compared to what you are paying. I‚Äôll definitely come back to stay here longer.","Stayed here when we were on our honeymoon and what an incredible experience we had. A serene environment, impeccable service and privacy that we wanted.
They have a decent restaurant within their property and provided airport pickup and dropoff. The pool and entire outdoor setup is great to enjoy and so is the open shower. For the weather that we had in February, it provided a great escape!","AVOID This Hotel. DO NOT stay here, the road outside Extremely Dangerous. Lots of robbers outside the hotel.

Upon arrival, the man at the desk was sleeping face down at the till.
Someone else came and sat us down, but he didn‚Äôt look like he wanted to be there. No warmth in the greeting. Ordered Nasi Goreng and Barramundi. No one was at the restaurant but food took a while to arrive‚Ä¶ >20min. Nasi goreng came out by itself - looked ok but lacking love. Tasted ok except chicken satays were stone cold! Made me feel a bit nervous getting sick on first day so put to the side. My wife‚Äôs meal didn‚Äôt arrive for another 15min‚Ä¶ we were hoping for the best but unfortunately the barramundi was inedible. After pulling it apart, the flesh was all sticky, either not cooked or super old. Handed it back to them, paid for one meal and left.
Had amazing meals at all other warungs since!
Maybe we caught the staff on a bad day looking at the reviews‚Ä¶ maybe they all had a bender on the Friday night prior!?","very cozy place, inexpensive and tasty food, I recommend it to everyone.",It's the best place I've ever eaten at!

All in all we would give this place a Firm 8/10. Thanks for having us üòä ‚ù§Ô∏è

Positive:
Good Location
Good rooms.
Clean.
Nice shared Kitchen.
Free Tea / Coffee / Water and honey üçØ

Negative:
‚úÖ Scooter üõµ area is very congested.
‚úÖ A lot of mosquitoes ü¶ü in and around this Villa. It is Bali after all.
‚úÖ Kitchen inside house a little messy as 1 cleaner who works very hard!","Hotel owner stepped uninvited into my room shouting at me that I can't expect a good cleaning when I only pay 15$ per night. This happened after I wrote a neutral WhatsApp that it was not cleaned the last time.
Cleaning is only once per week, and they forget half. For guests who booked over platforms, they maybe clean every day, but not for guests who pay directly (and due to less commission funnily pay more, but get a much worse service).
It is next to a main road where loud motorbikes drive at night.
Very small place, so no privacy. I overhead the owner talking bad about me to new guests.
The video was taken after the owner shouted at me that I'm wrong saying it was not cleaned and he personally saw that it was definitely cleaned.
Unbelievable experience.","Fantastic place, lovely staff and the breakfast was good too. Stayed for 2 days. Rooms clean, small pool, serene and calm area.","Amazing place with great people and great breakfast! The staff and the owners are very friendly and very nice.

I stayed in several places all over Bali and all were in a green setting but this felt like a prison to me so ultimately we changed our plans and fled the room to spend our last day. I'd recommend to spend a bit more and get something nicer.

The doors between rooms have had better times, couldn't be closed properly so insects and heat would get in. Things provided were basic, no soap bar (but soap dispenser in the shower), no separate towels for drying hands or using plunge pool.

Second day they asked if they should clean and we told yes. Didn't seem like they had done anything, not even new toilet paper was provided (we had to go to reception to get it).","This place is beautiful, i miss it already, i checked in on the 15th jan night, the owner is very friendly and accommodating, we were supposed to arrive in the afternoon but our flat was delayed, we informed him and he made the arrangements. Staffs was all super friendly, when i entered the room i was so impressed by the size and the feel of it. The honeymoon deco was nice too, so romantic and the bed oh my, it was so comfortable that i will fall asleep so easily on it. There is a nice private pool too. I also had a massage there, very reasonable price and i enjoyed every minute. I have no complaint whatsoever, would really recommend this place, very convenient to go from places to places the villa can help you with booking a taxi or if you want to rent a scooter. All in all a beautiful place that many beautiful memories were created at.","Very recommended... Great place to stay in Jimbaran, near to lots of beaches like Jimbaran, Padang Padang, Melasti.

Of the pluses, only that the villa is really spacious, beautifully designed and well located (supermarket and a pharmacy in front).
Minuses: knowledge of English at staff is very poor. In the presence of daily cleaning, its quality is poor.
Constantly turned off the electricity. For a month stay 7 or 8 times. Woke up at night in terrible stuffy, air conditioning did not work. Security level is 0 (CCTV cameras do not work, in our villa most of the time the door lock was faulty, the safe in the bedroom did not work).
!Theft!
We were robbed at night when we and our baby were sleeping!! It was not possible to find out who did this, either by the police or the hostess of the villa. Probably, the scheme is established and we are not the first.
Sincerely do not recommend staying here.

We stayed at Royal Tulip and walked out on both nights for dinner. The nasi goreng is really tasty. We like the ikan bakar and ayam bakar too. Eating there would be the best but the flies were annoying,"Great food! We stayed right next to this warung and we ate here 4-5 times. The food was always delicious! When you see locals eating in a restaurant, you know the food is really good.",Good local warung. Open kitchen where possible to see the people preparing the food. Except for the fish all fresh ingredients. Some a bit too specific spiced for me. In places like this I would suggest to go for the classics and not try to experiment too much :-). Friendly and helpful staff. Prices unfortunately not written on the menu,"Stunning place, cozy, delicious food"
