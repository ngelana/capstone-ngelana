On the other hand, the meat dishes are sooooo good. What's in the name, right.

Get a table, walk up to the counter to pick your cuts, and see how they grill it outside. üëå

Staff is great for people who just want to get their food and be left alone. We don't need chit chat anyways. ü•©","Nestled among the crackling flames of an open fire, the promise of succulent, sprouted steaks beckons diners to this establishment. The food itself is undeniably delightful, boasting flavors that dance on the palate with each savory bite. However, the experience is tarnished by the persistent chaos that seems to engulf the service.

During our visit, patience was tested as we waited over one hour for our meals to arrive. Disappointingly, no explanation was offered for the delay, leaving us to wonder if perhaps a heads-up about kitchen breaks would have been prudent. After all, such practices are customary elsewhere. The lack of communication was further compounded by the absence of even a complimentary drink to soothe our impatience.

Despite the delicious on-point-grilled meat, the disjointed service leaves much to be desired. While the allure of prepared steaks is undeniable, it's disheartening when it's overshadowed by logistical shortcomings. With some attention to detail and communication improvements, this establishment could truly be gastronomic delight.","3 stars because the sausages are over salted. It kills the taste.
Meat is good, service is good, they cook fast and really well!
But it‚Äôs really a low quality when salt is the main taste.",Quality meat with plenty to choose from and served according to your choice. Great place to hangout with friends and family,"This steakhouse is a meat lover's paradise! With an attached butcher shop, the variety of cuts including beef, chicken, lamb, and sausages is impressive. You're given the choice to grill the meat yourself or let the skilled chefs work their magic. It's a unique experience that guarantees a mouthwatering meal every time.

They play the Rugby and Football matches there too."

The decor of the hotel, wow amazing. Great place for pictures as it looks amazing wherever you go! I loved our room too. Spacious and relaxing.

I would recommend for sure!","place is very remote, breakfast is best avoidable and cheaper to buy at the hotel then online. Most of the ground floor rooms are very noisy and too basic for the price. Pics are photoshopped.","Room door was broken and open all the time, 24/7. They said it can not be fixed. Sink in the bathroom was damaged. Mirror damaged. Aircon was working very bad (either very cold or hot air). Closet doors were creaking as hell. WiFi was very weak in our room. No table at all in the room for working. First days even electricity had a few blackouts, but I guess they solved it later. Looks like the owner was preparing the hotel for the sale, and did not care about it at all. IN the common public area they even had a meeting with potential buyers (it's very unethical to the guests, who came here to relax).

The cleaning is terribly done.

The mold is being painted over before new gests arrive.

Hot water was not working often, internet was super slow.
Loud door banging sound on the roof when is windy wakes you up at night. Sounds like roof door are being kept open.

I can't help not to be very honest and list this all down here.
It did not feel nice stay, nor clean, fresh here.

What made our stay truly memorable was the staff. Everyone, from the drivers, front desk, to the kitchen and service teams, went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They‚Äôre the heartbeat of this place!

We did have a few issues, like the lighting being a bit too dim for our liking at night, the AC struggling during the day with the Bali heat, and some bugs visiting because of the open showers. But, when we mentioned it, Mr. Yonus, the general manager, personally came to see us. He was super approachable and did everything he could to sort things out for us. It‚Äôs clear the place runs so smoothly because of his great leadership.

Despite those small bumps, our experience was top-notch. The hospitality here is what you hope to find everywhere you go but rarely do. I‚Äôm already excited to come back to The Santai on our next Bali trip. If you‚Äôre looking for a spot with comfy vibes, excellent food & service, and a team that goes above and beyond, this is it.

Hope they can fix the AC issue soon! I‚Äôd highly recommend this place for a stay!","A beautiful resort villa in a nice location. The rooms were a good size and although the en-suite bathrooms were outdoors, it gave a nice Bali experience to the stay. As per a lot of the other reviews, the lighting was way too dim and it made it hard to enjoy the villa after sunset with low lit lights in the bedrooms and other areas of the villa.
The sliding doors to the bedroom and bathroom were an absolute nightmare to open and close. There are no handles to slide the doors open so I tore off 2 nails trying to get into the bedroom! I wish they had installed handles to make it easier to enter/exit each room.
The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great but all day dining was not so great and not recommended.
I highly recommend NOT visiting during Nyepi if you‚Äôre visiting for less than 5 days as you lose 2 days not able to explore  the city.
Also I‚Äôm not sure if it was just my bad luck in getting this particular masseuse (on the day of Nyepi where it‚Äôs was short staffed), but I do not recommend getting a massage. Having had massages in Australia, UK, all over Europe and even in Bandung, for me it was the worst massage I‚Äôve ever had. It felt like she had no idea what she was doing or she was out to torture me by digging into my back, arms and head, pulling out my hair (whilst I think attempting to give me a head massage) and was so rough when massaging my face that I got oil in my eye!
Other than that, our whole family had a lovely time during our stay and appreciate the hospitality of the villa staff.","Amazing service and rooms, the staff went above and beyond. The in house cooking experience was amazing, very very worth it

Extremely overcooked literally mashed, no taste at all (maybe just a little powder, not real bumbu spices). All the rest I tried was quite basic, and expensive (50.000 for some chicken and vegetables). Warung for Bule with prices for Bule. Not recommended if you like real Indonesian cuisine.","I'm sorry that I have to leave a bad review, but FINDING A DEAD CATERPILLAR IN YOUR FOOD is not a very pleasant experience.
I ordered 2 meals from them, but after that, how can I even ate the rest.
I always thought that this place care about the cleanliness of their food, but after today, I don't think I will go back.
If you happen to buy their food on 28th of March 2024 and you order some green veggies, just know your food was mix with caterpillar gut.","Good place for lunch meeting, simple and many of choices food here.

Nicely designed place and friendly staff and furry host (Bugie).

Love this place!",Never a poorly executed dish of the three times so far. Simply well-executed Indo greatest hits and some fun asides (fried banana with sambal) with fresh ingredients in a simple dining room with good service. No notes just cravings.,This is the best Indonesia restaurant we visit here in Bali. We already comeback 3 time in the past two weeks. Every dish it‚Äôs well prepared and the stuff it‚Äôs super friendly and efficient. Thanks btw the ice lemon tea it‚Äôs amazing!!!,"Nice place, spacious parking space, smoking area outdoor available, cozy interior with big sofa, comfy dine chairs, also aircon. Clean bathroom, clean wastafel area with big mirors.

Friendly staff and very helpful.

They need to improve for the food. We order gado-gado and tahu gejrot. The taste just not like we expected, a bit plain.
Asia is a land with full of spices. It should be reflected on its food.
I hope they can improve the food in the future, I can wait to revisit this cozy place.","a wonderful place to taste a glimpse of indonesia. This place is quite visible from the street with good parking space and with indoor and outdoor seatings.

the staff is helpful and they will warmly welcome you.

the food delicious, i love their iga bakar and their snacks... this place is very nice to have meet with friends, family or even a date.

looks like i might going to be a regular here.."

It‚Äôs a must try for healthy options and yummy food!,"How can you make such a watery and tasteless smoothie bowl? I had to add two bananas myself, which apparently they forgot to put in the base at all, in order to somehow improve it. It's not worth the money! If you had done it well, I would have returned to you every day, but with this approach to work, I will not return anymore.
In the first photo, what was brought to me, in the second I redid everything myself. I would like to initially get a good product, and not liquid tasteless water.","Cozy lively place near a road. Tried pull pork egg benedict and it was better than good. Nice choice of fresh juice. Lots of healthy breakfast/ brunch options in a menu like acai bowl, pancakes, omelette, salads.

My waitress was great. Very friendly and courteous. Unfortunately the rest of the staff were disinterested and unfriendly. The one who cashed out my bill was borderline rude when I asked about paying with QR. Perhaps it's time to add cashless payments as everywhere else uses it.

The pool at the 2 bedroom villa was awesome. Only complaint was the noise from the traffic but there is nothing they can do about that.,"Dapet free upgrade ke villa ini and it was one of the nicest villa I've ever been to. I got 2 bedrooms villa but since I only reserved for one room, the other room is locked. The villa itself is pretty spacious and have a big pool. Living room and kitchen is big and clean, and you got utensils for cooking and eating. Bedroom is clean and nice, and have a clean bathroom too. The minus is probably that the pool water is a bit dirty. But overall it was a pretty good villa.","Photos do this place justice. Was very dated and not well maintained. Had an overall dirty feel to it. We had breakfast the following morning which was probably the worst breakfast we‚Äôd ever had. Wifi doesn‚Äôt work very well, if at all sometimes. Bit out of the way if you don‚Äôt have a scooter.
We tried to leave a night early due to the above (with over 24 hours notice) and were told we would still be charged.
A lot of other nicer villas to stay at in Bali.","We were supposed to spend the 5 last days of an amazing trip in Bali. What a disappointment when we arrived in this Villa. The pictures were totally different from the one on the website. The wall of the swimming pool was grey and dirty, a lot of things in the bedroom were either broken (the shower...) or dirty (the net...).
Moreover, the WiFi does not work or when it works it is the slowest ever since the 56k Modem.
The people of the villa were very nice (receptionist etc...) but the office manager was the worst I have ever seen. When we complained about the problems, he was very rude and even asked us to come in the police station with him!!! A real joke and a nonsense in a country so nice and beautiful. For this kind of price, the others villas we did in Bali were so much better!! To avoid","Scam!! scam!! scamm!!!! I repeat Scam! Do not book this place. - Too much road noise
- Lights are not working
- Dark rooms
- Old medieval structure
- Not worth the money.
- Manager / Agent all of them are extremely incompetent & rude!
- We even had to involve the police.

Stay away!!"
