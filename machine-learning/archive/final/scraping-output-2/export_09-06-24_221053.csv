The room is clean, is a semi traditional modern hotel.

Although the parking area was small, but the staff very kind to direct our car to a good spot.

And this hotel give you a room for smoking and chilling with spirits of course.

Very Good,","With cottage-style concept, the room and environtment is large. The service is very nice and the crew is very polite and helpful. Food is standard. You can do laundry here. This hotel suits you if you plan to stay long time","the room is okay, but a bit scary, the tv can't be turned on, the remote tv doesn't work, the air conditioner is hard to turn down, I often come here, but today I'm disappointed, please improve","The hotel offers nice and clean bedroom bathroom with hot cold shower, no bath (but we dont need one). I love the cottage style room with big terrace. They don't have cable TV - although guests won't stay in the room for long - but I think it's nice to have one. The staffs are really nice and friendly, treat us well so we feel comfortable here.
I think this is the best budget hotel in the middle of Singaraja.","We got a single room bungalow. Room a bit smaller than other room, though the rate is higher. Very calm place in the middle of Singaraja area. We have checked other rooms, cheper rooms are in the main building, but bit dark some has no real windows. Overall, this is a good option for staying in Singaraja. Good price and staff are very friendly and helpful."

Aircon not cool. TV not working. Hot water unavailable. Unfriendly staff. Shame on OYO Brand for cleanliness and comfort. My son was badly allergic with dust. Please review the Hotel condition regularly so it won't mislead what had been advertised. Very NOT HAPPY AT ALL.","We were in this town for a visit, and it was a bit late to travel back home. I booked this place from OYO, and it was really fast booking.

Besides of the good deal we have from OYO application, the check in process was easy and fast. Receptionist was friendly and helpful.

Room itself is OK for a family with 2 kids. We had 1 king size bed and 1 single. Perfect for us. Room was clean. Got 2 bottles of complimentary water. By the way, they said if you booked from OYO app, we won't get breakfast though.

Aircon was cold, hot shower is available, flatscreen TV and it had usb plug if you want to watch your own movie from a flash drive or external drive.

Bathroom is pretty standard, It's a bit small for a big room. Also, they didn't give us bath soap, don't know if they forgot.

Anyway, we enjoyed our stay there. Good place for a very good price in the middle of town. You  can walk around the area to get groceries and other things pretty easily.","Okay, here's the bottom line. You are an explorer without deep pockets, riding all over Bali for adventure and fun, and you just need a cozy bed to sleep before you head out again in the morning. This hotel serves that exact purpose. Dont bother caring about cleanliness, or even hot water for that matter (as we didn't have hot water,) but the beds are cozy and it gets the job done at rock bottom prices. Noteworthy mention, you do get a free toothbrush. Hey... Real life means often ""roughing it,"" so you get what you pay for. Good luck. Oh and, there is great nasi goreng and other bargain, delicious foods in the neighborhood if you venture out and walk at night.","Good place for stay on Singaraja, near to everyplace on Singaraja.
But for water heater is not good, sometime it works sometimes it not work.
Please fix it. Have different price if you book on online and on the spot",Was about to give it 3 stars but decided to give it 1 star after i found A USED CONDOM outside our window. Easily the most disgusting hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The sheets floor and walls are so dirty.

Visit your business..
See what your staff are doing to your investment..
This is a franchise I presume and unfortunately my experience was far less than desirable.
And I  see by the number of poor ratings other customers agree with me.
The location is great,  very central and easy parking available in the front of the shop.
Inside is very small,  best suited for takeaway rather than dine in as I did.
There are only 2 tables and a few chairs for customers to sit on while waiting.
Inside first impressions.
Dirty.
Untidy.
Overstaffed.
Music incredibly loud.
We ordered 2 x Sultan burgers which are the pride of the business.
But it was horribly underwhelming with only 2 meat patties  and not 3 (staff obviously cannot count)
2 x portions of fries that were absolutely drenched in topping!!

Most Definitely Not...
