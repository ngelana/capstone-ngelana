However it’s a famous local food to taste and enjoy while u are in Bali n it’s very hot 🥵 or stuffy warm actually inside,"Great babi guling! Definitely recommend it for anyone who is a first timer to nasi campur Bali.
The spices are strong but not overwhelming, the sambal is nice, the pork skin is crispy and fatty, and the meat is tender. The satay is great, balanced sweet, salty and spicy.
None of the unpleasant / barnyard smell is left, absolutely great!","While the queue was very long when we came in on Saturday 1PM, we managed to put in our order quite fast. It took maybe around 15 mins to queue, the food came pretty long like 30 mins more or less.

There are two floors, so make sure you check upstair as well.

Overall, I enjoyed the nasi campur, everything seemed fresh and juicy and not dry at all. The only thing that I feel need to be improved is their chilli, as it was waaay too salty for me.","Local recommended this place, it was very busy and we waited around 30mins to order. After orderering we went upstairs where there was more room. The food came out reasonable quick despite how busy it was. Overall the babi guling was quite tasty but a small portion. Enjoyed that there was a variety of fried pork and grilled pork in the meal to try.","Best Babi Guling in Seminyak hands down! I usually make a first stop here after touching down at the airport, always a great way to start the Bali holiday!"

She welcomes me with a big smile and care to explain to me about the facilities there.
Second, I came to the hotel around 12pm  and was expecting that I should wait till 2pm to get a room, but the receptionist said the room was ready so I was able to take quick rest in my room.

I like the design of the room with that wooden panels on the wall. Also the room is very clean. I had severe allergy of dust, I can tell when a room is dusty. But here, I was able to rest comfortably without having to worried about the allergies.

The housekeeping did a very good job on cleaning the room, always get my towels and bath mat replaced everyday.

The breakfast however was decent, decently varies but not as varies as other 4 stars hotel I have stayed.

Nearby street is also very lively, you can find restaurants, convenience stores, and other places.

Overall I really enjoyed my stay here for 3 nights.","My suite room was huge with a nice looking bathtub, 2 big beds and microwaves! The food was so so. And some input for this hotel is their security, my baggage was left alone twice in open space after I leave it on their concierge. I took my baggage without anyone attending to my baggage every single time and no one confirming it. The security was pretty lax...","Location is great, not far from Kuta shopping walk & malls. Close to beach and many choice of seafood restaurants and there is a hospital next door should there be a need for medical attention.
Lastly staff were extremely nice, rooms were spacious and clean and simply thumbs up.","We stayed in this hotel for almost 2 weeks during last year (2023) eid holiday season.

Watermark Jimbaran has 2 swimming pools, lobby area and rooftop. Gym is fair and small (need renovation and equipment improvement).
I took their breakfast once while I stayed here. Nothing special, definitely Need to improve on their breakfast or food quality.

We didn’t have problem with food and beverages because it is located in Busy street of Jimbaran. You can order from Gourmet Garage nearby, Karya Rebo (balinesse pork resto), mixue or any surrounding restaurant nearby.

We took 2 deluxe room with Generous size practically great for new family with 1 children and for double occupancy.","I really enjoyed my experience at this hotel. The suite room is spacious, perfect for my big family. We loved the bathtub and the comfy beds 🥰🥰"

The parking lot under is so sharp , not safe for a small car, prefer parking outside.","The room was clean, the bed comfortable and tidy, the bathroom was smelling I had to have the door closed al the time.
But the biggest problem with this accommodation was when I ordered English breakfast, the eggs were cold, half of that plate was salad, there was one small tomato and like 5 grams of baked beans when I asked if they could give me more the answer was “no, that’s it” . I don’t know where this guy learned his cooking skills but probably he is just learning in this kitchen.
The other staff was nice I can’t complain, they were helpful.
So overall would visit again but would not order any food from the kitchen.","It was hassle free, good location, parking and reasonably priced breakfast buffet. The downside was pungent smell of the room, especially the bedding. Wall behind bed was covered by the mould. Few pints needed to survive it. Another minus was luggage storage - max of one day. Bit shot for a trip.","rooms was nice. Ac is cool. staffs were helpful. didnt take any breakfast so i dun have any comment on that. the cons were the soundproof, if you have noisy neighbour, it will be very noisy, u can hear the sounds from ur neighbours' room upper and sides",The room is clean and tidy.

Family trip to Bali and got affordable price on this hotel.
Location is perfect with large parking space, clean rooms with nice view and the staff is very kind.
Thanks a lot to Dendy the reception manager, he has helped me a lot by recommending tourist destinations and helping me find scooter rentals, and provided perfect service.
Will definitely choose this hotel if i go to Bali again.","My room was booked via an Airbnb, and it was the worst room I’ve ever stayed in. The room we got allocated was 228.

Apart from the hotel entrance, we got nothing like the photos on their Instagram and website. We checked in at 5.30 pm and left by 7 pm mainly because I was feeling sick (nauseous and hard to breathe) after being in the room for less than 30 minutes. I am sensitive/allergic to mold, and it caused me to start coughing later in the evening.

These are the issues we faced:

1. There was an incredibly musty smell in the entire room. Opening the balcony door did not help, as some burning was happening outdoors, and I could smell manure from the nearby field.

2. Damp and dirty bed linen. Both pillows had stains on every side of it. The room was so humid that the floor felt sticky.

3. The bathroom has two substantial mold patches. Visible mold is a symptom of severe mold problems, and the ventilator in the bathroom wasn’t working.

4. The side of the balcony was filled with cigarette butts and empty wine bottles despite our room being a non-smoking room. The receptionist even informed us that the smoking fine is 1 million k.

5. The rooftop pool wasn’t well maintained. I was hoping to have some fresh air on the rooftop, but I ended up walking away because three male hotel staff were happily singing with the audio system and smoking.

I tried to ask for a room change but to no avail, as they were fully booked. I told the receptionist the room smelt, and he seemed to anticipate it as he promptly said he’d get housekeeping to send an air freshener, which didn’t even arrive after 1 hour. Anyway, it is not like the air freshener will help or improve the problem but worsen things as it’s full of harmful chemicals.

When we checked out, he didn’t even ask us why and only said, “Okay, I’m sorry.”

Thankfully, we managed to find another hotel around 5.5 km further away from the airport at just $10 more with superior cleanliness and hospitality.

We strongly do not recommend anyone to stay here.

I’ve visited Bali more than five times and even India thrice; this truly takes the cake for the most inhabitable accommodation for me.","I stayed for one night in twin deluxe bedroom. I was so shocked when i went to the room and saw both of the linen so dirty and looks like it used already. The floor so sticky, lots of mosquitoes and balcony door doesn’t work properly with the lock.","1000/10 IT WAS NICE TRIP WHEN I GO TO BALII YEAHH, GOOD HOTEL!!!! highly recommended and close to the airport, I will come here again if I go on holiday again","clean and comfortable hotel, strategic location only 10 minutes from airport and close to tourist attractions.

Good honest food. Special thanks to staff Puti Ayu Dirwan Kadek Lita and Marcel.,"So at first I thought this is Seminyak’s branch, but it turns out a different warung. It is a branch from Nuri’s Ubud. It is my first time to eat in this branch.  The branch is much more “humble”. But the ribs is good 🎉","Yummy pork ribs, tender and melting in the mouth. Usual nasi goreng and mee goreng to accompany. Basic deco but food is good and friendly helpful service.","With a few branches around, we chose the one closest to the airport. Luckily, it wasn't crowded. Our feast included their mouthwatering Babi Goreng (BBQ pork ribs), pork satay, and Nasi Goreng Ayam (chicken fried rice). 🍖🍚 The ribs were the star – oh-so-tender with that incredible sauce, complemented by a spicy kick from the chili sauce. While the satay was slightly chewy, it still delivered on flavor. The fried rice? Yum!

Price is reasonable
This is a very standard traditional warung (restaurant).
Never expect a cozy place for traditional Indonesian restaurants.
But it if you came with cheap price and delicious food, than come to Indonesian warung.
The staff is very busy to prepare the ordered food, it’s kind of normal with no interaction between.
Order and paying everything will be done with the same people.
And this is the unique thing 😂😂😂
Anyway… I just focus on the taste or MIE AYAM (chicken nodule) and BAKSO, its was incredible delicious 😋","17 Oct 2023, mie ayam bakso + teh botol sosro, 33k Idr. Too expensive for bakso or they simply ripped me off! I think they cheated on me.","The food is okay, but the staff is not okay at all. I came to this place so many times and today when I want to pay, the tall guy is busy prepare Bakso for take away and he didn't realize that the ketchup was falling and it makes my pants really dirty. He didnt care and act like nothing happens, not even say sorry. I know they are busy, but they don't have any manner. Not even say thank you when we finish and pay, such a bad service ever I know 👌","Taste good,not pricy but sometimes server didn't aware with our order, so they skip or forget.","Awesome decent, down to earth Mie Bakso, close to my heart."

Also the bell boy was the same thing to them. Really disappointed with the manners and how they treat us.","Do not stay here if you cannot sleep in a dog kennel.

What an awful experience.

It started with the man who greeted us showing us to the wrong room. It was a much smaller room than the one we booked right at the front. We told him we booked a different room, so he took us to another one saying ""this one is more expensive, but I will upgrade you for free"". This didn't really make any sense since that was what we payed for already.

I've come to expect somewhat misleading photos here, but the photos for Kelapa are especially misleading. Everything in the room just looked and felt dirty. We really did not like that the bathroom had no door (just a curtain) and when we asked about it we were told ""that's the way it is in Bali"". This is not the way it is in Bali. This is the only place we've seen this so far.

However the worst thing about Kelapa Guest House was the noise. From around 6 PM to around 11 PM it literally sounded like we were inside a dog kennel. Dozens of dogs barking, howling, and yelping nonstop for hours. We even put ear plugs in but it couldn't block them out. Then all through the night they would start and stop. At one point it sounded like one of them was being tortured it was making such hideous sounds.

We booked two nights here but could only tolerate one. We left as soon as we could.

0/10","It's a homey place, quite nice, stayed here for almost a year. But too bad there's no hot water, although it's written in the facilities. Another deal breaker is the noisy dogs, they are often bark in the middle of the night, i love dogs but it's a guesthouse not a dog shelter.","Charming, quiet place to relax, with lovely, helpful hosts. The room was big and comfortable, A/C worked well. The breakfast was enormous and tasty. I will definitely stay here again when in Bali.",Comfortable and friendly and far enough away from the beach and mosques to be quiet. Free bikes for all guests so getting around is easy.

The only issue is that we booked twice on bluebird app a cab that could not find the place. Finally the owner dropped us to the airport. Also the hotel is nice but all around is not a great neighbourhood","I booked a standard room. The bedroom is comfy and spacey. It's suitable for backpackers and people who just want to shop around and travel for food. It's near to the airport. Less than 10 mins away by car. I didn't try their food but they serve simple breakfast, like fried rice, toast, coffee, tea, milk and orange juice. I think they still need to fix the bathroom. The floor drain is clogged up.",Very friendly owners. Great breakfast. Pretty clean but needs a little bit maintenance. Local channels only on TV. They let me borrow adapter for their outlet so that I can charge my devices. I had a great stay here.,"If you are searching for a budget accomodation around Kuta this is a one of the place you can enjoy your stay at Bali. Though it's a budget place they offer reasonable facilities for you including Breakfast. Staff is nice and friendly, always willing to help you. Specially the breakfast is really worth and taste."

So it's perfect for the first stop after you land in Bali!

The place is very clean and spacious, suitable for group events. And this is most important for me who can't eat food that is too spicy, it tastes really good!! The pork is also very crispy. The staff was really nice and friendly too

Oh! Their duck also looks delicious, maybe next time I will ask my friend to help wrap it 🤭🤤","Our driver brought us here and as we arrived early at about 10.30am, the restaurant was empty and it just didn’t feel like it was going to be delicious. I was so disappointed when my Babi guling arrive as the crispy Babi was a tiny piece and didn’t match my expectation.  It was when I started eating, everything including the chilli is so delicious that the size of the crispy pork didn’t matter, soup was very thick and flavourful as well. Both pork and duck also very crispy 👍🏻👍🏻","So far this place is the cleanest babi guling restaurant in Bali. Overall the food taste phenomenal, the portion is as what i expected which is not too big and not too small. For the bumbu kuning also taste great (as i can't eat spicy food and mostly babi guling's chillis are very spicy). The toilet is also very clean. Not to mention that this place is very near by the jimbaran beach and most importantly near by the airport! I was on my way from the airport to hotel and this is the best stop for my babi guling's first encounter. Excellent!","There was nothing wrong with the service. The food came out pretty quick because the place was empty. The atmosphere was abit bad. It had no music whatsoever and there was a baby crying very loud. The food was great except for the vegetables. They were very salty and unenjoyable. The pork skin was cooked in a unique way by frying the skin instead of roasting it which made it crispy but a little oily. The soup was good, it had no issues. For me, I think the prices are worth it since they gave a huge portion for 65k. The 50k one was also a huge portion.","Actually a very tasty babi guling restaurant, price below the average of chandra, mallen or karya rebo but comparable in taste. Lots of seats and parking space. Also near the airport so if you want to take a quick bite before flight, you could go there."
