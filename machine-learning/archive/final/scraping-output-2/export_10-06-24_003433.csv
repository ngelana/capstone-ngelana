Very warm hospitality and prompt service. The food was great. Breakfast was good. The pool looked dirty but they cleaned it upon asking. The Villas are spacious and modern. They have scooty rentals and spa services but you might want to compare the prices outside as the prices were quite higher on their menu. They also have complimentary cab service to the town area but driver wasn’t available when I wanted to avail the service.,"The place was not sanitized properly and you can see the cockroach, lizard and other pests roaming around. Scooty rent was quite higher than market rates. Remote location where you can opt for any other option. Not recommended.","Beautiful villa looking over rice paddie, away from the hustle and bustle but only a short scooter ride to Ubud centre. Good sized clean pool. Staff were all lovely and service was great, very clean too would definitely stay again highly recommend","My Wife and me where 3 nights there, it was so amazing, the rooms are so big, with big bed and a private pool, it has a bathtub, the staff is so so nice and polite and always willing to help, the food was always on time and tasty with fresh juice. They have a shuttle service that takes you to Ubud center, it was always on time to take us and pick us up. I really recomend this place it's just so amazeballs, 5 out of 5!!!",Scammer villa don’t ever visit this place worst experience unfriendly staff

If you wish to experience real Bali this is the place to visit. Waking up to songs of rice farmers, walking through village was nicest experience I had so far on my travel. Chafming staff were always there to help out with lots of advise, what to see and visit in Bali. There is local restaurant, where I had delivered my dinner to the villa.  You will need short taxi journey to get to local village Ubud. Loved it and I will visit again soon.",First time in this  villa and we love. Its  a very nice place to stay and the service is good.,I arrived here today and it was nothing like the photos. Waste of time and also lost deposit.,Away from everything. Quiet in beautiful Nature. Awesome Garden and architecture.,Beautiful rooms

If you wish to spend some time in a quite, beautiful place full of traditional atmosphere and nature, this is definitely the accommodation you need. Keep in mind that these goods go together with some natural noise during nights (I am ok with this but my wife needed a couple of nights to get used to this) and to some extent remote location (10-15 min) to Ubud centre by bike (though through stunning landscapes).","We had a great stay, the villas looked exactly as advertised and the owner, Kadek, was extremely friendly and tried her best to help us with any issues we had.

Of course it is the jungle so be prepared to deal with ants, insects and some small creatures.

Its worth noting that the location is a bit isolated and without any nearby amenities so make sure you get everything you need from town during the daytime",This place is magical. Everything is as pictured and described. Very clean. Very serene and tranquil. Near to Central Ubud but far enough away to escape its hectic clamour. It is surrounded by valley forest with a stream running through. Laughably serene. And Kadek the owner and manager is very wonderful. I can't imagine staying anywhere else if I return.,It's awesome place with surprisingly peaceful and quite. You can feel the jungle in here. The breakfast is really nice too. Except for the location(you definitely need a scooter) it's perfect place to stay. I'll visit here again soon,"This beautiful boutique 3 private villa property is tucked away down a small road amongst the rice fields and offers an oasis of authentic Bali. I totally loved my stay here.  Super fast WiFi.  For a place in the jungle and quietly located in the rice fields (3kms from Ubud) this is incredible!! Better than most 5-star hotels where you struggle for decent wifi in your room and have to go to the lobby. Wifi is accessible in every area.

There is so much care and attention to detail at Jungle Lotus Villas -  from the very luxurious bathroom amenities and stunning rainwater shower to the spacious lofty Lumbung style (traditional rice barn architecture) with wooden floorboards, a beautiful upper balcony opening up to jungle views and make sure you go looking for the meditation platform down at the river or improve your yoga practice in the yoga shala above the tropical garden.

Each lumbung has a private lounge - tropical living style - very comfortable and in keeping with the stunning Indonesian architectural style.  Great breezes flow through and the gardens are full of flowering plants.  Nature literally comes through the lounge.

The breakfast is incredible - the smoothie bowl was delicious and there are all sorts of other choices, too. Kadek is a whizz in the kitchen.

I loved the art pieces everywhere from the volcanic statue in the bathroom to the large welcoming Ganesha that greets you at the entrance. It’s an easy car/taxi ride - just ten minutes to town. I rented a scooter through the manager Kadek, and got really adventurous (that is not for everyone, but wow it’s a great way to experience the area and get places faster!).

Make sure you catch the late afternoon light around 5 pm. With a glass of wine in hand (yes, you have nice wine in your minibar fridge) you can take in the magnificence of nature from the pool or your private open-air lounge with billowy white curtains framing the view. I will be back. I have found my real Bali here.  Very attentive staff, always on call and a great place to base yourself with an easy run into Ubud and around for exploring the temples, waterfalls, art museums (start with The Arma) and the stunning rice fields everywhere.

Plus, if you are a runner or like long walks, you have a perfect, quiet running track - 3 kms flat road, flanked by rice fields, with no cars, just the local farmers smiling as you go by. Such a joy."
