Fantastic location that feels very quiet and secluded, with gorgeously-designed rooms and common areas. The pools and spa are lovely, and the food was generally excellent. The staff were also incredible nice and helpful without ever feeling like they were overbearing.

We'd highly, highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for an eco-getaway in Bali. We'll definitely be coming back the next time we make the (very long) trip to Bali.","Perfect place to relax and heal!
I loved this place so much, I extended and stayed over a week. This place is perfect to relax & heal! The resort is so beautiful, peaceful, quiet, and embedded into the nature. The food is delicious and the staff does an excellent service. The healing & wellness options made it special: the spa was relaxing, and I did yoga every day, meditation, sound & aqua healing, “optimize your inner potential” with a healer and acupuncture with deep stretching. The healers are experienced and helped me on my healing journey. I will come back!",What a Magical and Enchanting Resort.  The Team and Staff do an AMAZING job of making sure their guests feel at home and have an enjoyable experience.  From our check in to our Check Out Mr Komang gave us a 5 star Hospitality and made sure our stay was memorable.  I highly recommend this resort when you visit Bali.  The owner of this resort is very lucky with his Team of employees and staff.,"Trying to amazing experience in the middle of the jungle with this resort.
It was a good vacation, and I started to settle with them .
The experience of living in between the jungle prepared well.
Staff was friendly, food was good options can be modified with them.
I asked for airport, picking up service, and the resort was so helpful to support me with the service. It was charged cost me around 500 k rupees.
Floating food service was a little bit expensive around 300 k rupees ( just to repair the dish in the floating dish).

I think also, they need to check the privacy of the villas with swimming pools because I felt that neighbors can easily sneak during moving to their villas due to the open area in between Villa to Villa.

Place is magnificent and really was a good experience but if you don’t like knight animal sound because you are in the middle of the jungle, so you need to think twice before you try this experience.","Best hotel I have ever stayed at. It is just as gorgeous as it looks in the photos but what really makes it special is the heart that the whole team put into making this a unique experience. From the spa to the guided tours - everything was perfect and thoughtful.
Con really made our trip - he was so wonderful and an amazing yoga teacher and just a great human.
Devi was so lovely, bright and service oriented.
Gede was a great driver and even showed us some super local spots.

Thanks to the general manager to make us feel extra special."
