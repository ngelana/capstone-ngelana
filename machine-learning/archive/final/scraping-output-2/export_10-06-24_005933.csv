All the hosts were very friendly and helpful + the room and the pool are perfect as the location! Will come back for sure",Rooms are great! Recommended if you wanna stay a bit out of the crowd of Canggu but still 10 minutes drive in between rice terraces.,"Wifi isn't good. My room smells like urine constantly. The blankets were wet when I arrived.

The location is beautiful and cheap but the price reflects the room quality.

The staff is really nice and the view is beautiful but if you want a clean place with adequate internet this isn't it.

After I moved rooms the smell went away so it was definitely urine in that particular room.","terrible location, staff are rude and unhelpful, room was infested with ants all over the bed coming out of the floor, staff were moody and rude when i asked for a refund to leave absolutely do not stay here","The hotel is cheap but old. all the curtains are dirty and moldy, as are the bed sheets. One night I woke up because a rat was running all over me. I asked the staff to refund the money for that night, they refused and said that it was normal.

if you want to save money be prepared for rats in the room and in the toilet"

My husband and I travel all over the world and have stayed at some of the most amazing places, this quickly became one of our top favorite places we have stayed at.   The detail of the d√©cor was stunning, and kept true to the Bali culture.   I am detail OCD, so I pay attention to every detail!  I can tell the love and passion that went into designing and decorating this villa. It shows in every detail from the grounds, the furniture, the accents, the layout, to the comforts the villa provides.

Villa Shanti Staff; I say staff, but they became friends quickly.  They were amazing!  They were so attentive, so gracious, and such lovely people.  My husband and I celebrated our anniversary there, and they arranged for a special ceremony and saw to all the details, making it a very special moment we will never forget.  There was never a detail or request they didn‚Äôt attend to in the most professional manner.  (I might add, we may not have been the easiest group to see after, we had our 5 kids with us, our numbers alone were overwhelming :)

Jo was amazing to work with and make sure every thing was attended to before we arrived.  And through out our 2 week stay in Vila Shanti Sari, was in constant communication with the staff assuring our stay was perfect.  We experienced a bit of bad weather when we first arrived, and she was gracious enough to even give suggestions of things we could do in the area when it was raining.  Jo went far beyond what we ever would have expected to make sure every thing was just right for us.
The only negative part of our experience was that we had to go home, and leave this paradise.  It is a villa that once you walk in the doors, you won‚Äôt want to leave.   We are already in planning mode of how soon we can get back!",Shanti Sari to tranquility,Nice place to get some rest after long trip,open 07am - 10pm,Exotic!
