Kayu Dui, Dusun Sukadarma, Tejakula, Tejakula, Buleleng, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81173, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=6795696985960772816,OPERATIONAL,+62 852-3735-0144,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.6,88,,"Located in a secluded corner of northern  Bali, surrounded by fishing villages. It's a perfect place to rewind and relax. The private outdoor bathroom was a pleasant surprise to us and I literally showered in the rain one of the evenings. You can get very close to mother nature here.

The hotel has direct access to the pebble beach. The sea here is calm most of the time and there is a good snorkeling spot in walking distance. If you are interested in diving, it offers diving courses at all levels. The swimming pool is 3m deep, which can be used for diving course.

The salt farm has stopped operation due to the rainy season when we were there.  If you come from May to November you will see the salt farm operation.",Just leaves a sour taste to charge 15% of nightly rate for an hour late checkout when no one even bother to talk to us after 11:59 am and we checked in at 9pm and we're the only guests at the resort and didn't even have hot water in the shower. Other than that a great stay. Just leaves a sour taste to leave like that.,"Amrita is magical, intimate and comfortable. Amazing service, very private and everything you need for a magical stay. We hired a scooter and ate dinner on site. Good quality and great price. Everything you‚Äôd expect for the low price. Great breakfast. Incredible location and loved watching the salt farm at work. Very low key.","We stayed here for 2 nights in April 2023. We booked the family room which offers a HUGE space: 2 bedrooms with individual outdoor bathrooms (also huge), and a massive living area with full open plan kitchen. I forgot to take photos but the space is huge! There's also a wide decking area right outside, with private steps down into the garden.
Things I loved about The Amrita:
- Beautiful location right on the beachfront. Those sunrise views are simply unbeatable!
- Vast living area, a real feeling of space.
- Quiet and tranquil setting, ideal for a couple's holiday, or a yoga/meditation retreat.
- Warm and friendly service.
Things that could be improved:
- There only seems to be three staff in the whole place, and they do everything: cooking, cleaning, check-in/out etc.
- Breakfast is only served at 08:00, which fits with the laid back vibe of the place but isn't great if your kids wake up hungry at 06:00 (like mine do üòã)
- Food isn't great, and there aren't many options for restaurants nearby.
- It can be hard to find, down a winding little jungle road (but thankfully there are signs all the way down)

Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and would come back again.","Nice hotel with a beautiful view. But guys, get a cat! Rats run around the room even during the day. We were having breakfast and a rat ran past us, right under our feet. Kitchen, guys, learn how to cook delicious. Cleaning, this also needs to be paid attention. You have a beautiful place in your hands, you can turn it into an oasis!"

Every detail of the experience is thoughtfully crafted - from the stunning architecture of the villa to the personalised and attentive service provided by their staff.

We had a room with a stunning view that looked out to the ocean. The large bathroom has a bathtub and an outdoor shower.

We enjoyed a private boat tour for dolphin watching, went snorkelling, swam in the pool everyday, had massages and loved the 5-star meals prepared by their talented chef.

What truly made our experience unforgettable was the incredibly warm and attentive service provided by the team at The Jing. They always made us feel special, and this is why we'll always look forward to coming back one day.

To the team at The Jing, thank you so much.

Geoff & Emily.","What I‚Äôll remember the most about the Jing is the little things.

How once I had requested for hot water with my coffee led to hot water being served with my coffee over the remaining duration of our stay. Or how once I requested cold water and mentioned in passing that I prefer that and everytime the water served was cold.

The owners have make such gestures look effortless & we had a man amazing time having long conversations over dinner & breakfast.

As for the space, it‚Äôs well designed & brings the best out of the oceanfront views.

I‚Äôll be back.","For a month and a half now, I have been connected by a story with the Jing Hotel.

Having lived here, I can say that everything is wonderful here, from the amazing staff to the small details like a silk robe, straw hat and beach bag.

Any request at this hotel can be fulfilled. Any request, any desire of a guest is law here. The hotel is run by lovely people Vera and Will and their dog Flow, whom they kindly adopted after finding her in trouble on the street. They have such love and passion for what they do that I wish everyone could find something that you can do with the same love.

They can organize an excursion to any part of the island, help you sew dresses in a local atelier, feed you delicious food and warm you with warm words. I consider the second floor to be the best place in the hotel, because it offers an incredible view of the sea. If you meditate at sea for a long time, you can see dolphins and whales swimming by. There are a million goldfish swimming in the hotel, you can feed them and make a wish that will definitely come true, because miracles happen here.

The villa is equipped with good lighting. In the rooms you can find handmade natural linen lamps, and in the lobby this establishment‚Äôs signature feature: a chandelier made of natural quartz stones, which will give you an incredible boost of energy for the rest of your life (photo attached). Also, the entire villa is enriched with natural stones, which have enormous strength.

Swimming in this luxurious pool will definitely make you feel like a king or queen in a modern castle. I can write for a long time about the advantages of this place, but it‚Äôs better to see once than to hear 100 times.

So come and see for yourself.","We were amazed by this property and the owners Will & Vera. The experience in this villa was everything great at once.

Since they only rent out 3 rooms, the silence, the tranquility, the zen are the best you could've gotten ‚ù§Ô∏è

The rooms are spacious, we especially love the spacious bathroom, and the beautiful outdoor shower.

The room rates include a hefty breakfast, an afternoon tea set (with delicious cookies or crumbles, anything Vera-made is wonderful), and a superb 3-course dinner, with customized menu and they're all different day by day.

They have many activities you can choose from. I requested a massage and it was wonderful. They also provide yoga class and other things.

We told Will & Vera that the stay was for our honeymoon, and they set up a romantic candlelight dinner at the gazebo by the ocean on our last night.

We appreciate everything the staffs did for our comfort during the stay. And of course great conversations with Will during our entire stay.

We'd love to come back, and we want people to know of this great property. Thank you!","This place is charming! Everyone is trying to make you feel special during your stay. What makes this place exceptional are the little things - cookies in the room, herbal shot in the room before the night, fruit platter, afternoon tea with amazing desserts.

The villas are designed really beautifully, spacious and luxurious. All the details fit together, especially the lighting of the entire building with side lights and minerals that are everywhere around.

The price includes tasty breakfasts we enjoyed every second. Dinners are prepared by an excellent chef, we liked everything, including the wine suggestion.

Yuni's massages are the best I've ever had in my life, that woman has a gift in her hands! :) I recommend rebalancing and abhyanga massage.

The staff is very respectful, kind and smiling. They will do everything they see in your eyes and remember all your preferences.

I will definitely come back here for a longer stay, I'm already dreaming about it!
Thank you!"

The pool is beautiful and well decorated.
Dedicated personel coming over for food was very polite, discreet and have cooked tasty dishes for us.
Definitely recommended for a peaceful stay.","Peaceful and calm place with wonderful views of sunrise and sunset. Very tasty and fresh local food: eggs, fruits, fish (mango was taken from the tree near the villa) Gorgeous! I truly recommend!",Gorgeous sunrise and sunset daily. A great place to explore the local lifestyle. The children enjoyed it very much. I like very much the dishes prepared by the family chef.,,
