You can find a lot of flavour varieties in this place, maybe well over 60 flavours. Flavour wise it is pretty good and the portion is very generous!

The staff are pretty helpful and it will assist you in choosing flavours because i am sure that you will be confused on what flavour you want to pick

Place are pretty big also, it even has outdoor space.","SOOOO MANY FLAVOURS and such a spacious place! They've got at least 10 tables outdoor and some tables inside as well. I was so excited and wanted to try all the flavours but there were just too many!

Please note that they don't accept card payment so make sure to have cash ready! We went first time and didn't have any cash on us so we didn't get to order anything, but we went back the next day prepared.","An incredible variety of flavors at Gusto Gelato! The staff were also very accommodating, allowing us to try different tastes before making a choice. The space is generously sized, offering both outdoor and indoor seating, perfect for enjoying not just their ice cream but also a wide selection of other food options. Highly recommend for anyone looking to satisfy their sweet tooth in a welcoming environment.","It's a fantastic ice cream spot, widely popular for its variety of flavors. I'd recommend giving the matcha and bounty a try. they're not only delicious but also reasonably priced. Keep in mind whether you prefer sitting inside or outside, it tends to get quite crowded at times. Overall, it's a great place to enjoy dessert with family and friends.","Visited with friends for a sweet treat near closing time, and surprisingly, the place was still buzzing with activity! A plethora of flavors, some even quirky and unimaginable, but delicious and budget-friendly. My only regret is not being able to taste them all lol.

Great value for money and a simple and easy menu. Don’t go here unless you like pork.

My recommendation would be to get extra soup. The sambas were unique and spicy with a touch of lemongrass. The pork, juicy and succulent. What else can you ask for. Bring cash.","23 Mar 2024

I've been patronizing this place for quite sometimes. Still a little hut in the old days.

Nasi campur babi guling is still the same. Add an extra babi campur guling, delicious.

Balung pork soup is tasty, too, probably with lots of MSG 😂

Pork satay just so so, better ones are out there.

When it is crowded, it would be hot inside there. Luckily, it was still empty when I arrived.","We arrived here for the first meal in Bali. We had high expectations for this place after seeing that it had very good reviews. It definitely lived up to expectations. The pork skin was super crispy and crackles in your mouth once bitten. The pork slices were extremely tender to chew on. The pork crackers were super crunchy and did not feel very oily as well. The meal was slightly spicy but still manageable for someone who doesn't take a lot of spice.

We managed to find a seat pretty quickly on a weekend afternoon for a group of 10. The dishes were served very quickly (less than 10 minutes) after we were seated.

The interior seemed quite dark and had flies and mosquitoes flying around but we finished our meal pretty quickly so it didn't affect us that much.","food did not live up to the hype, the whole dish was extremely spicy but delicious (not the best thing i’ve eaten in bali) the portion is enough for 1 person & at the bottom of the pork dishes are cassava leaves. the pork skin was so hard it can break a tooth, but the light brown one was really good.","As it is highly reviewed and close to where we stayed, we tried it. The food was good but not spectacular, not making me want to come back if not for the strategic location. Located on Sunset Road. If you are not good with chilies maybe ask them to separate the sambal/chillies, it was spicy."

The highlight of our stay though was the staff member August (I hope I’ve spelt that correctly). He came over to chat to my kids and next minute had them up playing soccer, he was so genuine and sweet and my kids absolutely adored him! He’s such an asset to your hotel and really did make our stay memorable","Trans resort exceeded any expectations we had prior to booking.

We stayed in a single room villa complete with our own pool, butler service, fantastic privacy and good proximity to the main part of the resort.

We used the spa service twice, first because we had a complimentary couples massage and then again because the first massage was so incredible. Our villa was cleaned/refreshed twice a day with plenty of bottled water provided.

Location was great, just outside of the busyness of the clubs and restaurants so we had plenty of quiet at the Villa. We often walked to the main strip which was about 10-15 minutes, otherwise Gojek was a very easy app to navigate.

The friendly staff and impeccable service was the real standout. No matter who we spoke with, we were greeted with such kindness. Special mention to Nanda at the bar in the lobby, he made the best cocktails in the whole resort!","Our stay at The Trans was excellent. The service and the staff remember you throughout your stay and really do go the extra mile to make your stay special.

We had multiple staff members remember us personally during our week long stay which was awesome - but all staff across reception, concierge, food and beverage and the spa were great. The food, rooms are great as well.

The resort feels high end, the pool is excellent and the location is only a 5 minute walk to the heart of Seminyak’s great restaurants, bars and clubs. Would definitely recommend and stay again!","I recently stayed at the Trans Hotel with my family, and it has become our go-to place whenever we visit. From the moment we arrived until we checked out, we were greeted with exceptional service and a warm welcome. One of the highlights for us was the variety of activities available for kids, and the pool water temperature was just perfect - we could spend the whole day in the pool without feeling cold. The food was delicious, and the hotel's location is convenient, with a supermarket within walking distance. Overall, I can confidently say that this is the best place for a family stay.",Lovely rooms. Staff unbelievably friendly. Buffet breakfasts are so good. Unfortunately a bit away from decent shops and restaurants. But taxis are only a few dollars to get you anywhere. Hotel has a shuttle bus. 3 times a day.

The pork knuckles was juicy and not tough, but I recommend eating it first as the crispy skin will turn cold and hard quickly.

They have seating inside an air conditioning area and a surprisingly cooling outdoor area. It still felt a little hot so remember to ask for indoors if you cannot stand the Bali heat.","Pork ribs were very decent. Smoked pork rice was good too, though fairly greasy. Would've liked to try the pork knuckle but it's only available as a very large serving. Worth a visit.",Had dinner here at around 7.30pm and there’s no queue.. when we came out there’s a lot of people queuinh outside.. the pork ribs was good and the pork nuckle was great as well we ordered the 800g 1 portion.. the two vegetables that we ordered was yummy as well. The es campur was good and refreshing as well after all the pork ribs and pork nuckle. Spend about 1000k plus abit for 10 item price wise i think reasonable.,"Nice place for a bite. Ideal for groups. The food is good, but quite expensive, for the quality and taste.

The ribs were good, but definitely not the best.
The vegetables and crispy pork belly slices were really good.

The coconut they serve as a drink was humongous and also had dessert built in, so was quite welcome."

I was very impressed with the friendly and helpful staff who greeted me with warm smiles and quickly assisted me with the check-in process. The room I stayed in was very comfortable and clean. The room design was modern and minimalistic.

One of my favorite facilities at the hotel was the pool. The large outdoor pool was perfect for relaxing and cooling off.

Highly recommend this restaraunt.","An amazing asian restaurant with super kind service, perfect atmosphere and a beautiful easygoing design & vibes , do not skip this one!!

We like our lunch over there so much that we returned to dinner on the same day, since it was our last day in Bali!

For lunch, we mainly ordered some small dishes and starters for sharing, and we couldn't decide which dish we like better - the bao gao was super soft and delicious (one of the best bao buns I had in my life), the fresh Viatnemese rice paper rolls were so fresh and the hoisin peanut sauce was sooo good!
The som tum made of green mango was so refreshing, and lastly, the crack & sluurp wok dish was so authentic and flavorful.

For dinner we wanted to try totally different dishes but still keep the sharing menu vibes, and yet again each dish exceeded the previous one.
We ordered the gai lan which was so special and surprising with salty flavors of soy sauce, the bun bo xao with lemongrass pork was also super flavorful and delicious, and the thai green curry was again so authentic and special.

For drinks we ordered the lychee mojito & the lychee blossoms which were both amazing & very refreshing.

Make sure to visit their bar upstairs which has a totally different vibe, and super kind service like in the restaurant on the first floor.","Highly recommend the try everything entree! It was amazing!

The rest of the food was really good too. Drinks were good. But it ended up being a bit expensive.
Customer service was good. It's a little dark but they can give you a light to read the menu.","If you’re into cheap and delicious food then this is the place for you.

We then had a North Indian vegetarian meal of paneer tikka masala and kadai vegetables and daal tadka. Got roti, lacha paratha and chapati for the breads. Absolutely fantastic food.

I think I have found a great tasty alternative that you should try. The cheese naan was amazing with the melting cheese oozing out the warm bread. But many of their dishes were just excellent.

The service was more efficient than most and the food came out fast … and almost all together at the same time.

It is located in Seminyak main road however this restaurant is convenient to get to without suffering from the traffic in Raya Kerobokan or Oberoi.

Actually at first I underestimate this place because of the cheap price, but since they already have open a new branch, so I think the taste will not that bad.

FYI, my experience is only about the 10k sushi, I didn't order any sushi from the menu in their tablet.

Sorry to say, this is the worst sushi that I've ever tried 😅
- The taste of the salmon on my sushi are not fresh
- Almost all the sushi from the conveyor belt contains tempura crumbs inside, and I think it's too much 🤔
- The staff didn't refill the empty wasabi and the ginger on my table (when I came, the wasabi and ginger on my table are already empty)... I already ask for help using the apps from the tablet, but the staff never came. So I end up took wasabi and ginger from another table.
- It was difficult to get salmon sushi from the conveyor belt, mostly only crabstick / chicken / beef
- I tried the beef sushi, but I didn't expect it was a beef floss sushi 😅

My stupid conclusion:
if you are used to eat a good sushi, don't come here for the 10k promo, because expecting IDR10k sushi with good taste is too good to be true 🥲","Omg its not even worth it🥲
Due to the limited space, if we come not more than 3 people, you have to sit at the bar and cannot sit at a regular table, as those are reserved for groups of 3 or more. The staff is quite friendly, but unfortunately, the menu is very limited and appears to be hastily put together. Even there is no chili sauce in here🙃. The sushi looks messy and unappetizing. I apologize for being honest, but this is the reality, and the food seems awful.
I suggest that the owner should seek references from well-known sushi restaurants in Bali.","Ordered via Gofood. Worst sushi ever. Looked okay in the box but not very fresh. Lots of crumbs, and one of the Tuna rolls definitely tasted off. Didn't want to risk of food poisoning, so threw it out. Not ordering again .",So- so food. The sushi from the conveyor had different variants but they all taste the same. We also ordered from the menu but it doesn’t have a japanese taste at all. So disappointed. Though the ordering is fast and the staff is nice,"Good place with great service, staff are well trained with nice attitude. Place is clean and bright. Sushi taste great and have many choices, drink was okay but need improvement.
Overall Great, maybe consider to have chairs on the front for waiting list because when the place full, people on the outside restaurant don't have place for waiting.

Decided to drop by and try a little bit of everything.

Place was clean - it was a small air-conditioned shop by the road, with a lot of grab delivery riders waiting for deliveries. Could tell they were popular on grab.

We ordered the sweet noodles with spicy minced chicken, chicken porridge and the minced chicken with glutinous rice. They were all pretty good. We also got a chance to try their local root beer. Price was reasonable as well.

Worth a visit if you're craving noodles for breakfast","The food was really goodd! But i think the portion was not that much compared to the price. There‘s a lot of option which noodle do u want to order like normal noodle, Karet and etc. Yamien (with sweet soy sauce) or normal. There‘s hainan rice and Chinese porridge too.","The porridge was nice, even tho its a bit expensive compared to other chicken porridge in Bali 😆
My favourite topping are Tahu kecap and Telur Pitan.
I want to try Bakmi next time,looks so yummy and interesting because they have many kind of noodle  🤤
The staff is so kind and friendly. 😊","Bakmi karet komplit, chewy texture yet so addictive! Pulled braised chicken as topping, with choice of 2 fish balls or 2 beef balls,  and 1 piece of wonton that comes also with soup (broth).
Bakso goreng amazing too!
Next time when I’m around I’ll try the porridge for sure.","The best porridge in town! You should try everything here. Yes! Everything! Bakmi, Bihun, Bubur, Nasi Hainan… all are delicious. My favorite is yamien asin komplit with small noodles. Try the cakwe too! For you who worry carbs, worry not, they have Shirataki Noodles!"

The atmosphere is chill and inviting. The prices on the menu already include any service charges, which is very convenient, I wish other places had the same policy.","Nice cafe, with beautiful decor, but the food just wasn’t up to scratch for me. I had a chicken wrap, but it wasn’t really wrapped. The fries were luke warm. The nice fork also made gripping quite difficult. It was very well priced though. Perhaps I should’ve gone for a more brunch type meal.","This place has 2 separate dining areas but they don't have a designated smoking zone. 🚬🚭
So it is not very pleasant. Especially in the morning, often quite a few elderly smoke in this cafe.
Otherwise food is good, tho sometimes if you ordered fried egg you can see that the kitchen has somewhat dirty pan to fry the egg. 🍳
Smoothie bowls on the other hand, one of the best in Bali.","Absolutely fantastic cafe! Service, food, atmosphere are great. We’ve chosen to sit upstairs and it was perfect for us.
Big brekky and porridge in the picture😛😇❤️❤️❤️"

Let me know if you'd like adjustments or a different tone for the review!","Nothin special.
Burger taste okay, the whoper cheese doesnt taste like what I expected 🥲
Fries taste good as usual.
Ice cream cone taste good and light, not too sweet.

Kinda Overpriced for locals.
The staff is so friendly  😊","OMG SGD$7/- meal for a little royal chicken burger ? Suits kids tummy but not for adult.

How come the ang mo burger bigger than mine ? See last image. Hope BK not biased against Asians ya.

And how u dip this burger into this small little opening ??

Fries so salty which can cause health issue also.

Everything to me stunned like vegetable !!",This is what they advertise vs reality of what you get. Sorry but this should be illegal!! Once again the standard of my whopper was not good enough. PUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SALAD. Why are Bali Whoppers so cheapskate ??!,"For any foreigners wanting to try this BK, just want to give you a warning my partner and I got food poisoning from here. We ordered 2x cheeseburger combos and was sick for 3 days. So I would eat with caution."

Worth to visit and try their cheap and good food, owh yeah you can still watch your food process.","The food here was sooooo good. There's an aircon room as well as an outdoor area where you can watch them make your teh tarik and roti. I'm a fan of every single menu here, from chicken curries, to sweet roti and egg roti. AHHHH I'm drooling now thinking about it! 100% recommend this place.","Clean spacious restaurant. Has a semi outdoor area & air conditioned area. Service friendly. Can be quick if not many customers but very slow if lots of customers as they seem to only have 1 grill to cook roti. Servings are snack size. Would recommend mutton curry, was so tender.","Their 'Teh Tarik' is a must try!! good services and the employees are friendly, the Apple Cinnamon roti canai is recommended. They also have Nasi Kuning for Rp5.000 (small) and Rp8.000 (large)",I was in this place so great idea to lunch. The food is think kind of Malaysian not indian food. Bcs indian food the taste of curry not at all same. but still yummy. price also cheap and the location really strategist. come here and try the Teh tarik

Only 10 minutes walking distance ro Bintang Supermarket and around 15 minutes to Seminyak Beach. Good wifi, good staff. I will recommend this place for your stay at Seminyak.","I've lived in many colivings in Bali, but this one was the most beautiful.

It is perfect for digital nomads, as you can comfortably work from the room or in the open space next to the kitchen.

The malai tikka, pudina tikka, masala papad, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, dal makhni were all on point! The breads were warm and fresh. We visited here multiple times during our trip, it was that good!","Great ambrience and great service.

Good starter (samosa (4/5) and dahi kabab (4/5))

Good main course (good Indian touch— daal tadka (5/5), kadai paneer (5/5), jalphrezi (4/5))","I rate this place a 2/5 at best due to the quality of food, service and price to portion ratio at this restaurant.

From a portion size perspective and a reference to gauge, see the image of one of the main courses costing 99,000 rupiah alongside the salt shaker. This compared to its competitors around the corner is almost 1/3x more costly. The curries we ordered were quite sub-par, I personally wouldn't go there again. It's likely targeting tourists that need a fix of Asian food while on their holiday but doesn't deliver quality.

Furthermore the waiting staff forgot items off the order even after they noted it down, and repeated the order. These forgotten items only arrived once reminded and after almost 15mins. By this time your appetite is gone.

My other recommendation is to split the bread basket and not have all the different breads/naans ordered all stacked up on one pile. This way we could not identify what was what, this becomes a massive issue when we have people with specific dietary needs.

The owner also had a ""we are always right"" mentality which was not pleasant and unprofessional. Not a way to run a business.

The ambience was great, it was nicely decorated but the lighting was poor.",Price is too much high in terms of quantity. Restaurant is indian but quantity is like Indonesian restaurant. Just a cup of rice like locals.  Spent 32AUD. In Australia we get 3 times of the amount of rice u gave for the same price

I enjoyed the dishes here, especially Cevapi. It was really unique that combining beef and lamb, served with sour cream and pita bread. The minced meat was kinda like sate buntel here in Indonesia. It was juicy and flavorfull. Everything was good, but the staffs need to be trained more especially the female one who served us on, because her product knowledge was below standard. She explained that they did not use Aqua brand but forgot the name. But then she came with Aqua reflection and told me that it was different brand to Aqua. Despite of that, everything was nice.","Early dinner on a Sunday, it's pretty quiet, just a few customers., so you get to enjoy your dinner. They have   a pool table and live music only on certain days, twice  week. Their cheese burger is great the meat is tasty and tender ozzing with cheese. The french fries cut thick but tender. Great BBQ sauce to go with the burger. The bun is rather sweet for my tastebuds. The portion is just right for a lady my size, not so sure for other ladies and men though."
