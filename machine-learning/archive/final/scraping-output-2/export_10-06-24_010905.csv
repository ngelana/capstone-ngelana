Well located with many food shops and transmart located nearby.

I thought that the parking was amusing

There are about 10 car spaces in front .
Management and staff occupied at least half of the available parking space....
And paying customers had to park down the road in another space..

A unique feature is the breakfast menu, where you can choose between toast or rice balls (onigiri). I had the toast and egg set, while my friend enjoyed the onigiri and miso soup set. The onigiri, made with what appears to be japonica rice, had larger and more flavorful grains than the typical Balinese rice. The 2.5 cm thick toast was fluffy and delicious, surpassing local bread.

A great value is the morning set available until 11 AM, which offers these breakfast options for free with any drink order.

I recently visited and appreciated the extended hours, allowing me to indulge in their offerings even during odd hours. I opted for their milkshake and chicken katsu. While the ambiance was pleasant and the service accommodating, I found the taste of the dishes fell short of my expectations. The milkshake lacked the richness I anticipated, and the chicken katsu was decent but not exceptional.

One downside was the waiting time for the order, which seemed longer than expected considering the fewer guests present. However, the staff was courteous and attentive throughout.

It comes with a closet albeit the building is a little bit outdated but comfortable nonetheless. It has a decent size pool and a rooftop patio for you to lounge around in addition to restaurant area. You get the 1.5L of water everyday and service has been quite wonderful with minor adjustments like we all know how it‚Äôs like when you stay for a while at almost anywhere. I like the vintage and homey style of the building reminds me of my grandparents‚Äô place. They have interesting looking trolley perfectly fitting in the building. Microwave for God‚Äôs sake! Don‚Äôt you just love the unit? Simple kitchenette with a couch on the lower level of the unit. Rainy season can be dangerous though. Very slippery floors. Some days towels smell wonderful like they come out of steamer minus the warmth. Some days they look lumpy. Best value for family stay still.,"Good thing abt thiss place the room is quite big,like apartment. U have kitchen downstairs and sofa . And enough space in bathroom.
Its not a super clean but bedsheets and towels was clean and they clean room every day. I think it‚Äôs worth money I pay
Location so quite and a but far for everything but depends what are u looking for. I felt a bit unsafe","If you're a non-smoker, keep away. The place constantly reeks of cigarettes. :-(

This is a shame because, it's otherwise a lovely spot. I like the separation of the bedroom and family room.","Underrated hotel. Low price with good service and big room. Really enjoy it and makes my Bali vacation feel great.

The room which I stay has 1 king size bed in upper floor and 2 single beds in lower floor. The bathroom is big, but i don't like because placed on upper floor. It also has little kitchen with microwave and refrigerator.","Stayed at 109. Really nice room. Spacious for people of 4. The room really match the description. The room is clean and very well maintained.
The staffs are so friendly and helpful.
The hotel itself is in a very strategic location.

I really recommend everyone to try this hotel especially who travels with family üëçüèª"

A basic but comfortable bed and air-conditioning that works alongside a hot shower.

At ","We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by 2 male staff who hardly spoke any English, tried to hold onto our passports and demanded a 300r room deposit. After several discussions, we were shown 2 different available apartments, neither looked clean or anywhere near acceptable but given how tired we both were we eventually settled on one.

My Birthday Cake and Pillow request had been totally ignored and I had to request two pillows from reception, one stain covered pillow arrived.

The apartment was filthy, disgusting, sheets had stains, towels were grey and had dirty marks, kitchen had mould, bathroom was repulsive, Air con was very noisy and we both became nauseous.
At this stage instead of resting we decided that we would check out the following morning and we started to search for an alternative hotel, which we found and got extremely lucky.
With our bags packed we came down for a quick tea and coffee and possibly breakfast. The breakfast area was completely empty of any guests, the room was dark, repulsive with an abhorrent stench.

The Tea and Coffee had not been switched on so was served to us cold, there was no European Buffet or English Breakfast which I had paid a premium for $140.00, Just left over-
‚Ä¢ Fee for English breakfast: approximately IDR 100000 per person

-ASIAN food which looked detestable. We were offered some white bread toast and some fruit which we did not see available within the breakfast area. The waiter also offered to make us some fresh tea and coffee as he could see our frustration and I think he was embarrassed by the state of the entire service.

Just as we were leaving the apartment to check out, I had a quick look out of the window at an empty pool that was grim and loathsome, it looked like something from a ‚ÄúChernobyl‚Äù documentary.
As we checked out, the receptionist was clueless, she contacted the Manager who did not appear, our request for a part or full refund was ignored completely and at this stage we both were ‚Äúover it‚Äù and just wanted to hopefully re-start our break.

This place maybe cheap but is seriously crap in all areas, we made the mistake of budgeting in Bali, if you can't afford anything else, work another few weeks and go somewhere decent. NOT this place","Stayed with friends for 4D3N in November 2023

Internet connection - spotty and a bit slow most of the time.

Furniture - old and outdated

Bathroom - old and saw some small cockroaches in the toilet and kitchen cabinets

Kitchen - no appliance except for electric kettle for boiling water. Saw some small cockroaches inside the kitchen cabinets and under the sink

One Free bottled water everyday for each person staying in the room

Only toothbrush and toothpaste are included in the kit.

AC is old and faulty. The AC in the main room doesn't even make the room get a bit cool despite the hotel service ""fixing"" it. AC in the living area keeps timing out even if the desired temperature isn't reached.

The entire hotel looks old and gets a bit spooky at night.

Great view on the balcony but you aren't allowed to hang any clothes outside.

Staff are friendly and accommodating. They let us stay in the lobby and use the WiFi while waiting for our room to get done.

Swimming pool is wide and looks like they also conduct swimming lessons there since we saw some kids being taught how to swim.

There are 2 lifts but only 1 is working.

Location is strategic with a couple of food courts and fast food chains nearby.","Value for money!! Stayed here for 5 nights (5 adults). Everything went smoothly from check-in to check-out process. The staff was professional and friendly. Every requests was fulfilled. Room was huge with 3 bedrooms, balcony facing swimming pool, complete amenities with aircond in every room. The place was quiet at night and you can find restaurants and mart within short walk distance. Agung Bali was around this area too. Gojek service passed this hotel area frequently.","This hotel is located in a place within neighborhood, there is access to a lot of basic needs and restaurants, and local eateries. The hotel appears to be big, however the maintainance is not so great, the corridors and rooms are not tidy, beds are not neat, the staff does not respond to very basic questions.
There is value for money for me, since I opted this place for an overnight stay to reach sanur harbor next morning.
I have not explored the restaurant within or any other amenities, hence I cannot feedback on the same."

I can't stay in a hotel like that so I decided to check out and I think the staff has experienced the same situation with other guests because they didn't look surprised when I checked out in less than 1 hour after check in."

Just that if you're not good at fiery food, make sure you order extra drinks to help you out. They've this tea which goes well. You can have it sweet (teh manis) or without sugar (teh tawar). A word of caution, the sambal that comes with the blanched vegetables is superb spicy!

We ordered the one with broth and it was spicy. The fried version isn't spicy. We also ordered the fried fermented soy beans which is something I really enjoy and fried tofu. We added on the minced chicken satay as well. Those are good too.","Ordered 1/4 ayam betutu goreng and tahu tempe.
The soup is quite spicy, if you can‚Äôt handle spicy taste, be sure to ordered the fried one because they separate the soup.
Place is huge, come at around 2 pm so it‚Äôs has only few customer.
Easy to find on gmaps.","Tried Ayam Betutu for the first time in Bali and pretty much enjoyed the meal. What I really like was the kacang goreng and tauhu goreng.

They seem to have a good crowd of tourist coming by the bus loads.","One of the best restaurant for ayam Betutu.

I order the Ayam Betutu package which come with the braised chicken, rice, satay lilit, and vegetable platter consist of boiled cassava leaf, nuts, and sambal.

The braised chicken is delicious! It is soft, juicy, and pretty spicy! The satay lilit is the best satay lilit i've eaten so far, it just delightful!"

You can choose chicken only, chicken & pork or jumbo size.
Do expect rude services, not so clean and the portion size may vary each time you order dine-in or take away .","The place was busy and bustling. Cheap dishes that are popular amongst the locals here, both for dine in and delivery. Would recommend the ayam betutu here. Be mindful of the hot kick from the chilli though!","I would given more stars if my husband and I had not experienced rude behavior. We have been to Liku a few times and our all time favorites have always been their nasi ayam betutu with chicken satay. Deep, rich of herbs and tasty ! The chef's did an amazing job with the delicious dish but the staff is letting them down. This is a shame !

Two things that were really a red flag for me :
First, the way parking attendant treated us. He was rude and didn't help us with the parking stuff though we have to pay him money.
Second, there was a couple of staff that were nice however the cashier staff who was supposed to help us during payment process was horrible. She was ignoring us and busy chatting with the other staff until we asked her attention.

Service ruined the experience. That made me unhappy and normally I don't write such a review like this to my favorite restaurant. So in saying all the above, unfortunately we won't be going back !","I've been here twice. And it has now become one of my favorite traditional food spots near Denpasar. The nasi campur were lit, and the rates were reasonable. This eatery offered numerous nasi campur varieties. I tried them all, and believe me, you'll love it.","This is a hidden gem definitely!

The price was rather below the similar restos but the flavors was indeed worth more than the price.

I came here like 4-5 times during my 2 weeks visit in Bali.

There are pork or non-pork menu, but I suggest to choose the pork one, with it‚Äôs specialty beverage called ‚Äúes gula‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know what exactly es gula is, but it‚Äôs definitely sweet and has faint sour flavor like lime. So refreshing

Definitely will come here again on my next visit to Bali"

The lady behind the counter did not repeat my order, neither screen available for us to reassure that she took proper package according to what I ordered. I have assumed that I will need to pay at the highest price for my order at the time we are driving to the next counter where I should pay and take my food. And yes, that happened as what I thought, the lady gave me the food which is consist of 1 burger, a drink and fries (small one), but when I checked the bill that she handed I found that I have paid for the price of the KING BOX package + an upgrade to a bigger fries that she did not hand to me until I requested! So, I double checked to the lady what I have paid for and she responded to my request in panic and finally handed me the KING BOX.  We went through before I got the chance to open the paper bag. But then I got another suprise when I opened it, the fries that I got was a small one, which I have paid for the upsized.

What a bad day for me! But I bet they have done it to many customers that do drive thru order. I think Management should take seroius action on this matter, otherwise the bad reputation will be labelled to your business. Bad luck to your business!!

P.S.: The Cheese Whopper also didn't really taste like Whopper which I recon should have a special sauce (of Whopper) taste. I can only taste cheese, veggies and a plain patty. Too bad! :(","Quick service, not too busy. Quite, plenty of parking available.

Coming from a different country I loved how the food has been quite customised for the country.
The meal comes with rice, I loved the spicy chicken meal with rice.","Wanted a double whooper cheese.
No stock.
Incompetent purchasing

Polite staffs.","I ordered a royal chicken meal and 2 beef burger meals. Unfortunately my royal chicken burger had 9 bones, 3 big bones and the rest were small bones, imagine if young children ate this burger, what do you think it will happen?
The only advice from me is, be mindful if you choose to buy the chicken burger for your child when you're in Bali. It is not safe."
