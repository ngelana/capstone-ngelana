It‚Äôs quiet, luxurious, and fully immersed in nature. The staff took care of so nicely just like their family. We loved taking a shower with banana leaves around us, taking a dip in the pool while seeing the stars, and waking up to birds chirping and humming. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to have an escape from the bustling touristy area. 100% recommend!","My partner and I recently had the pleasure of staying at Magic Hills in Bali, and it was an experience we'll never forget. We stayed for one night in the Nomad House, and from the moment we arrived, we were enchanted by the unique and beautiful design of the bamboo house.

Despite being an all-open house, we were pleasantly surprised by how comfortable and cozy it was to sleep in the Nomad House. The mosquito net protected us well from insects, and even though it was raining at night, it felt super cozy and peaceful to sleep here.

The upstairs area of the house was our favorite spot. Here, we had a delicious dinner prepared by Samaya Dining, complete with personalized service and impeccable attention to detail. As we dined, we were able to watch a movie on the projector, which was so cool and definitely added to our overall experience from here.

The next morning, we were treated to a delicious breakfast that was both beautifully presented and incredibly tasty.

Overall, our stay at Magic Hills was nothing short of magical. The combination of stunning design, impeccable service, and breathtaking views made it a truly unforgettable experience. We cannot recommend Magic Hills highly enough and look forward to returning in the future.","Staying at Magic Hills will probably be one of the most unique experiences in my life. The bamboo house is surrounded by tropical nature, and the staff treated us so well like their family. I also really love the outdoor shower and bath. The sound of birds chirping and insects harmonizing at night was also very healing. We will definitely recommend this place to whoever wants to experience real and peaceful Bali.","Ambience is excellent. We stayed in summer house and it had an amazing pool. Only drawback is it‚Äôs little open and there is no door or curtain in the first floor.
Complimentary breakfast is useless for vegetarian as the quantity is too less and meagre. Just two small pancakes or oatmeal.
No vegetation option for lunch and dinner as well.
Location is little green and feels little scary at night as it‚Äôs absolutely silent and we hear all the sounds of nocturnal creatures which makes the stay very memorable and unique.

Food is a major miss and it could perhaps be little hot in peak summer I guess.",I had the most magical experience in the Queen House. The view was outstanding from everywhere. All the details are incredible. There was a lot of creativity when designing all of their houses. The breakfast was amazing. The staff was so friendly and went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. Can‚Äôt wait to return in August :)

Water pressure is very good. Stunning view from the windows when you have a bath in the bathtub. Fully equipped kitchen, very convenient to use. Two toilets at different floors that people live upstairs don't have to go downstairs to use toilet. Stunning view of the field. It's not the best angle to see the rice field, but it is good enough to enjoy at the second level. The garden and the swimming pool design is so beautiful with beautiful lights. We found frogs, geckos and fire flies at night. Cute creatures! Very supportive staff providing good service.
Only the quality and the taste of the meals don't match the high price. The beds are damp.","Wow. This villa is even more impressive than the photos. On arrival, you check in with the Magic Hills Reception and the staff are so nice. We were able to check in early too with no issues! The villa is beautifully designed and comfortable. Watch the sunset from the hanging net or the bathtub, you won't forget that in a while. There are insects that come and visit you from time to time but the mosquito nets are there to protect you when you sleep and they also provided a spray which worked well too. You can hear the sounds of the jungle all night which was soothing to us! Also the staff are so responsive and helpful with anything you need - my husband had a minor back injury and they were so quick to respond to pick up some medicines and check in with him as he recovered. They also arranged a driver for us on request when we wanted to explore east Bali and also transfer to the Gili Islands. Can't wait to stay here again someday!","Makerti is such a beautiful and unique Bamboo house in one the most beautiful areas of Bali. We had a perfect stay here.üòä Even though it's in the nature it's super comfortable, cozy & quiet and we had no bugs in our room. I can really recommend to add this place to your Bali trip!","Makerti just recently opened up and it‚Äôs a bery beautfiul Bamboo House located in the middle of nature. Stayed there last weekend and had such an amazing time! Not only is the villa and the design super beautiful, the staff is also sooo kind & helpful (thank you Gusti & Gede).

And if some of you worry about bugs etc since it‚Äôs an open Bamboo House: I didn‚Äôt experience any of that ‚Äúinside‚Äù the house so I had a very pleasent stay overall. Will definitely be back ‚ù§Ô∏è","Had the honour to be the first guest of this amazing villa. The views are extraordinary, it‚Äôs very private and has an amazing sunset view. Perfect place to slow down and relax after staying in the crowded south. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!! Also Gede is such an amazing host helping you with all you need!"

Very kind people.

Update: we just had dinner. And this was very good too. Peanut Sauce on the chicken satay ü§§","What an amazing place with Stunning scenery! We had a romantic dinner setup and it couldn‚Äôt have been more perfect.

Ultra professional and helpful staff ready to make you feel as comfortable as possible. The food is served timely and with proper pacing between courses.
Quantity and quality of food was just perfect!","We had food delivered to our villa. I had the Wagyu Burger, which came with fries and onion rings on the side with some sriracha sauce. The burger was tasty and the salad inside was fresh. I found the sauce a bit spicy but I still had it with the fries. The service here is the highlight. Everyone is very friendly and happy to help. The positive attitude is infectious and I leave every interaction with a smile. Thanks a lot!","We got island grilled chicken and wagyu burgers. They delivered the food to our room right on the clock!
I love the burger 's taste as I didn't need to add any sauces. Fries and onion rings were still hot and crispy
My wife said the grilled chicken tasted very authentic and veggies cup was deliciously spicy!",I order burger and french fries the  tastes very good with view of the rice fields is impressive. The service staff is excelentü•∞ü§©‚ù§Ô∏è
