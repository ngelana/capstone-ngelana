But the restaurant had bugs all over the tables and there were only one waiters. The location is remotely tucked away in quiet and beautiful area which some locals have used to there favor and made a check point at the cross roads on the way to the hotel. Calling it ( local taxi ) which is Taxi mafia in all seriousness. The hotel is aware and didn‚Äôt do nothing and is also helping these horrible people. Even if you book a driver through grab they won‚Äôt let your driver pass the checkpoint!,"The room is quite big, clean and the facilities in the room is perfect.
The staff very friendly and helpful, the staff at the bar and restaurant are very kind and awesome coffee, cocktails and food are made as my request. They are go above and beyond to serve great food.
Location is a bit far, but the resort offers to picked up us. It's very great service.
Once you arrived you will forget the busy traffic and road. Only feel the nice nature, good views and enjoyable place for holiday.",We booked the resort last minute for one night off season so we had no trouble getting a spot. The resort is quite new and a bit tucked away so it was a bit tricky to find. The staff was very helpful and eager to improve and cater to their guests needs. We left at dawn and they were kind enough to pack our breakfast. The only negative experience we had was that there was no hot water in any of the bathrooms while we were there.,"We stayed for 2 nights si we could reste before going back to our country. Our room was very clean and bright with two balconies.
The personnel was very friendly but not always available.
We got no one to speak too when we needed a towel for the swimming pool. My partner asked several times if they could organise an romantic dinner like proposed in the services but although they said they were going to keep him informed, nothing happened.

Room service is easy to follow with an app, you receive a code but nothing shows you if the ordre is being prepared or not (see picture). I think there should be more information such as how long it normally takes or what to do with this code ? I waited one hour for one meal and drink (cold).

Breakfast is a menu where you can choose from several dishes, Sweet or salty. Only the croissant was industrial and very dry but all the rest was delicious. I ordered shakshuka egg, avo on toast, French toast, pl√¢trer of fruit.  You Can order as many dishes as you want but only at the restaurant. You Can not eat breakfast in your room.

They offer many other services but all are extra.","Exceptional service, amazing experience and the perfect place to cool down after a week of Canggu. Very welcoming staff, felt at home the minute we walked on the property.
Perfect for when you‚Äôre only interested in enjoying the hustle and bustle that Ubud can offer for a couple of hours and enjoy peace and quiet in the evening and morning. Would give 6 stars if the music playlist at the pool was more diverse.

Every single person of the staff was kind and caring, unreal experience!

Looking forward to coming back!"

Overall 10/10 experience and I would totally recommend

The only CON I would mention is the fact that if you are to speak to your family members on the other side of the planet and the time is very late you would have to take into considerations that other tourists next door will hear you, cause for some reason there's no isolation of the sound

Other than that, the place is stunning, spacious rooms, modern bathrooms, and the garden view is out of this world","We had only planned to stay a week, but the place was lovely and Kadek and his family are great hosts. We decided to stay for another 3 weeks.
We totally recommend this place, the breakfast is excellent, the best we've had in Bali hotels. Kadek and his family are very kind and helped us with anything we needed.
Cleaning is done every day, wifi is excellent. I work remotely and need a very strong connection and this was perfect.
We'll definitely be back.
Access to the city center is difficult on foot but they rent bikes for a reasonable price.
There's also a laundry nearby and a few restaurants within walking distance.","I really love here. I felt like this is my house because the family very lovely,friendly,helpful, take care of your stuff when you‚Äôre not at home.

It's a pity I have to write the review this way but you guys should all know what you are paying for and this, in fact, is not what you have been promised in the pictures on booking services, neither on Google.

Nor only the people but also the interior feels so warm and welcoming. We loved the place and felt sorry everytime we went out. Perfect place for some morning yoga, reading a book in ine of the chill corners, and take a swim with a beautiful vieuw over de rice paddies. Definately wanna come back one day. Thankyou so much Della and team, you were a great host!","Love this place. It's my fourth time being here. Great rooms, great views, very relaxing atmosphere. Come here to get away from the hustle bustle of the city.",Located over the hill at a traditional Balinese village... serene with spectacular view... surrounded by lush rice field...,"Great place, friendly people, quiet and relaxing.  Great getaway from the city's buzz.",10/10 the most beautyfull place we found in Bali!

Not far from the main road and have great view. But there's only 3 rooms and i came with more than 6 people's so it get really stuffy in there. All the things are ready to use except the coffee machine because the previous one didn't throw the coffee out and some mold are growing like crazy in that machine. Overall good experience living there for 3 days.,"Really nice place.
Thanks for great weekend.",üíöüíö,BEAUTIFUL !!!,
