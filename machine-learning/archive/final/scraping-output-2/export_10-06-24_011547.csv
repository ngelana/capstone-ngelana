But the seasoning for the rice bowl was a bit too sweet and pasta was overcooked. Drinks were delicious! We had a mocktail and coffee. Staff were attentive and friendly as well. Overall had a great lunch here, aircon was super strong and really saved us from the heat!","Wide selections of foods and drinks. Spacious co-working space, clean, cozy, and very comfortable. Service was good, just a lil bit pricey.","10/10 recommend!!! We had such a nice breakfast there!

First off, the restaurant itself so super modern and comfortable. Upstairs is a working space and the overall ambience is one of the best I have seen in whole Bali.

The coffee was absolutely amazing and to the point. Got a oat-milk latte and it was exactly how it should be - so good!!

For food I got the avo toast and added two poached eggs. I was so happy with it bc they put it on two slices of bread and usually when I order avo toast I only get one slice. Was a very good toast and can definitely recommend!

Will definitely go there again!","Had breakfast here ..
I love evry single food and beverages that we order, worthy and not pricey..
And from this place just need 10 mnutes to GWK, so u can stop by before","The ambiance the morning we came in for breakfast was impeccable. The place was stylish, clean, bright, and airy. The stage by the entrance promises live music at night. We stayed on the ground level and the high ceilings and relaxing music added to the experience.

We ordered their Breakfast + Coffee bundle. I had the Brekkie Burrito with hot mocha and Kara, my wife, had Mushroom Toast and a flat white. Both dishes were season quite well. Very delighted with our choices. We ended with a Banana Split for dessert. The bananas were lightly caramelized and the dish was delicious overall.

The staff were warm and friendly and the service was excellent. They informed us that the lowered level was booked for an event and that we were welcome to join but in case we might get overwhelmed with Russian, we might want to move upstairs. Very helpful.

Worth the ride up and down the steep roads from our villa to get here."

Really like the quiet environment.","Super good. Rooms are standard but the pool space is beautiful and it also has a yoga space. Price is super cheap, really good for installations. Service super friendly. One thing is that they do not have water.","I absolutely recommend this place. You'll be treated to breathtaking views of the iconic GWK statue and the tranquility of a charming, peaceful neighborhood.

The guesthouse is a haven of relaxation, boasting a beautiful swimming pool, inviting common areas, and a fully equipped shared kitchen and dining area.

What truly makes this place shine is the warm and caring owner and staff who go above and beyond to ensure your stay is exceptional. The rooms are bathed in natural light, creating a delightful ambiance, and the efficient air conditioning provides a welcome escape from the heat. And don't forget the joy of a hot shower right in your room.",I can‚Äòt understand why the reviews here are so good. Sleep is nearly impossible because of the roosters screaming literally back to back to back no pause. The bathroom was maybe clean but it stunk so hard from the drain‚Ä¶ Also we only got 1 roll of toilet paper and the rooms can not be completely darkened,The rooms are spacious and clean. The location is excellent. Airport 15 min. And the people are kind and professional. I totally can recommend the place

They asked ur preference coffee beans
This place kinda hidden, its across alfamart goa gong.","Just found this interesting cafe. They have indoor space in a Bali old style house called ""Jineng"". Balinese people usually use Jineng to store rice grain in a bulk. From the up stair you can see the area below the Jineng and of course the lamp looks cozy from above. If you want to sit upstair you should come early because there are only few tables upstair. If you visit this cafe, went to upstair to order your menu. They also have free wifi and electrical socket, u can work here. I just came here once, but I think I'll come again to taste their signature menu. Recommended üëå"
