Rooms are clean and have everything you need, there is also a shared kitchen you can use.
The surrounding nature is just amazing!
Well worth a longer stay üôèüèºüòä","My partner and I had such a wonderful time at Budas Guesthouse! It‚Äôs located on a rice field and away from the crowds you‚Äôd see staying closer to Denpasar which is perfect if you‚Äôre looking for some peace and quiet. Buda offered us a scooter rental service which helped us get around to the beaches nearby (~10 mins away) and get some of the best food we‚Äôve had at the nearby restaurants (~5 mins away). If you‚Äôre looking to cook your own meals, Buda‚Äôs quest house is fully equipped with kitchen. We even booked a surfing lesson through Buda which was one of the highlights of our trip!

Buda and his family are some of the nicest / most accommodating people we have met on our journey. I‚Äôd definitely recommend staying here.",Great spot! Buds knows all the surf spots and super helpful. Great for long term too.,"Very nice, new, clean guesthouse in a quiet area of Kedungu. Very close to surf. Buda, the owner is very welcoming and helpful.","Perfect stay. Immaculately clean, super comfy, rural views, quiet but convenient. Balinese hospitality. :)"
