The cafe is completely staffed by the kids with the help of their teachers. They used a unique method of helping the kids remember the menu by categorizing dishes according to their friend‚Äôs photos! I had the chicken teriyaki and lemon tea and it tastes delicious. All the proceeds go into their education and therapy so don‚Äôt forget to shop for beautiful handmade trinkets made by the kids after your meal! Definitely a must stop by if you‚Äôre around the area. Tips: Come before 3pm if you want to watch the kids learn and have fun at the center.,"Beautiful and yummy, we can really recommend it üôèüèºüíú","Beautiful cafe with a fantastic view of the surrounds.  We stumbled upon Piduh Charity Cafe when doing a search for 'ethical cafes'.  Our only mistake was the we didn't book ahead which is required as the staff and students prepare the menu in advance and we arrived towards the end of service (completely our fault). The food and drinks menu looks amazing. The staff and students were able to offer us the pasta with piduh pesto at short notice which was delicious.
It's well worth spending a small amount of your tourist dollar to support a worthy cause that makes such a difference in the lives of these young people with special needs.  And it is quite the instagrammable location to boot!","This is the most amazing place to visit for lunch. The staff have graduated from the school and have been trained to assist and work in the cafe. They do a wonderful job and the food was delicious.
Please visit and support this charity.","The Food was good, but the drink not so (okay)."
