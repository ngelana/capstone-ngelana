The owner gives such friendly service, goes out of her way to recommend places to visit. She even accompanied another guest to various sites. She allowed us to use her scooter at no charge. The lodge is very ecological, breakfasts includes many things from the garden. Loved our stay!","This place is very special and was one of my favorite stays during my four months of travel. Ketut‚Äôs refined sense of beauty  and hospitality can be felt in every thoughtful detail from the design of the rooms and the tranquility of the gardens to the delicious healthy breakfast, ease of communication, and a general sense of being welcomed and cared for. I enjoyed my showers while listening to the birds sing, tea on the porch with the cat while looking at the treetops, and excursions to the many temples and waterfalls in the area.  It was the perfect place to recharge after spending time in Ubud.","Highlight of our visit to Bali. In particular,  take the time to visit with Ketut, the owner -  experience this lovely part of Bali through her eyes, learn about her work to keep her village clean. Walk to Tirta Empul via the rice paddies.

If you want to explore further, go out for dinner in a neighboring town, Adi can provide taxi transport.","The room itself as everything you can wish for: super comfy and nice smelling bed, waiter boiler, tea, coffee,  amazing bathroom... together with those little details like home-made soap and a beautiful desk.
The joglo it's beautiful, with tons of different plants and tress that take your breath away and a really good breakfast in a full of good taste decoration.
But! The best part is Ketut, the owner how dreamed and build the space from scratch with a lot of love and dedication.
One can really feel the amount of heart the putted in the Joglo!
Also she takes care of everyone as family and I really felt like I always staying at a friend's place as we went for a walk together through the forest until the temple.
What a lovely, multi-tasked, beautiful woman!
So go ahead and book a couple of days. I really feel I didn't stayed enough time...","One of the best thing happened to me on Bali. So much love in everything about this place ‚ù§Ô∏è Ketut is a wonderful super woman, she cares about everything and you feel yourself here like at home. Location is amazing, accommodation is extremely clean and affordable, breakfast is like your mum cooks for you before school.
Must do‚Äôs:
Buy soap by Ketut
Buy jewelry by Ketut
Allow the miracles around you happen
Allow yourself to relax and enjoy simple things
‚ù§Ô∏è thank you so so much for this experience"
