There‚Äôs no entrance fee and we got 14 free samples of coffee and teas which we ended up bought some at the shop. The view was wonderful and the service was great!,"A nice place to recieve simple live presentation for a local coffee farm and a interesting dining places. The curving wooden bridge like building is lovly and surprisingly it's a restaurant.

At the entry the visitors will be leaded by an interpretor. This place is highly commercialized and tourist orientated, therefore it's quite clear there's left not much space for slow movement. A lot of tourists coming and going... taking pictures...very few visitors would have stay for further appriciation of nature and so on.

The whole process shall begin with a quick and short introduction from the working staff, soon after tasting apprax. 10 different sort of coffee then he or she will take you to the shop. So that's it!

Well, afterall we bought the original Bali coffee and a bag of Avocado savor Coffee for curiosity.  But not any other kind, simply because we are no fan of sweet Indonesia coffee with bonbon savory.","15JAN2024 OKA agriculture@TAPAK SIRIH BALI   ID‚Ä¶

The only thing is that it is more like a garden shop, they don‚Äôt have coffee plantation downstairs. But that doesn‚Äôt influence experience at all.",Coffee and tea unites! Best place to enjoy local products with an amazing view to the hills. It's a well maintained and organized establishment. So much informative and fun activities while sipping down their homegrown coffee and tea products. Nice location with plenty of parking space provided.
