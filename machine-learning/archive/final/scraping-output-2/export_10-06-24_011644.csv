The rooms are divine, as are their pools. The lobby lounge will take your breath away with its view. The staff are all so super nice and goes the extra mile. There are activities daily, from yoga and biking to pottery and batik. You’ll never be bored spending the whole day at the hotel!

The best best best part is the breakfast selection!!! Truly as good as a dinner buffet complete with options for all diets and tastes.

The hotel made the highlight of my trip and successfully made uluwatu my favourite part of Bali.","If I could rate this higher than five stars, I definitely would. The rooms and pools are outstanding. The view from the lobby lounge is breathtaking. The staff are incredibly friendly and always go above and beyond. There's a variety of daily activities, including yoga, biking, pottery, and batik, ensuring you'll always have something to do without ever leaving the hotel!

The absolute highlight is the breakfast selection. It's as extensive and varied as a dinner buffet, catering to all dietary needs and preferences.

This hotel was the highlight of my trip and made Uluwatu my favorite part of Bali.","Came here for our honeymoon and it was amazing. The staff were delightful and very accomodating. Always willing to help. The amenities were what brought us here in the first place. The best pool we have ever used, simply gorgeous. The breakfast buffet was a joy with options of Indonesian, western, Indian and an egg station. The resort itself is a bit far from everything but we quite enjoyed this as it provided us with peace and quiet. There were also many activities always being held such as sushi lunches, shuttle buses to their own beach club and fitness classes. Would definitely recommend staying here!","We had a perfect stay at Rennaissance Uluwatu. The hotel is splendid, with fantastic views of the sea, village and jungle. The infinity pool is absolutely amazing, the spa is of fantastic quality (the best massage we had in Bali, and I'd even say in my entire life). The staff everywhere was super friendly and they seemed genuine, as opposed to some other places in Bali where the smiles were a bit fake. The restaurant (we only had time to try 1 out of the 2) was super nice, the food was delicious and the menu - very diverse (we loved the many interesting cocktails) - although pricier than the rest of Bali, I'd dare say it has Italy prices. Then as for the room: our suite was perfect, spotlessly clean, with a tasteful style and decorations. They also have free shuttles to their beach club in the South of Bali, but we didn't have time to try that one. This is genuinely the best hotel experience of our lives.","Came here for our anniversary celebration - with the reviews expectation was a bit high. But my oh my, we were quite happy. The team at the resort was always friendly and eager to help. The view of the resort was wonderful, being perched on top of the hill, overlooking the sea.

The room that we booked, deluxe garden view was in no way small, but because the bathroom was huge, the room was a bit on the small side, however it was comfortable and we had everything we needed. And when they say garden view, the view is really of the jungle, not some parking lot.

The highlight was actually the food, breakfast in the morning was really great, with high quality ingredients, Double Ikat is also a must visit, we ate in that restaurant every night for 3 nights, the Indonesian food served there was fantastic.

They had the clay making class as well. It was chargeable but definitely worth it.

All in all, we had fun in that resort, and it's worth it to stay there."

Don’t just come for coffee, they have an impressive selection of apparel, surfboards and accessories. I bought my first board here with the help of the owner, Komang, he took the time to explain which board would be best for a beginner and why.

Stanley","Best coffee in town and amazing selection of surfboards! We always buy our boards here, Komang and his team are super competent and know what they’re talking about! So happy with my new Synergy!","I’ve always loved their Almond Iced Latte, and usually visited their Canggu outlet. Just because my boyfriend wants to check the waves at the Dreamland beach we visited to have some coffee and check the goods stuff at BGS Dreamland.
It was cool coffee and Surf shop, although I still prefer their Canggu and Uluwatu outlets. Also because the service there was so much better and friendly to all customers than here, I feel like the staff could be friendlier. We will be back, hopefully, to see some improvements. Parking for a few bikes, for cars maybe you can park at the mini market.
The menu has quite a few options. The shop is decorated with surf accessories and apparel.
Good luck BGS.","Love this BGS with all my heart!
Come here every morning to grab my fav cappuccino with its original almond milk, witch is amazing.
The staff is always super friendly and welcoming, love to talk to each of them.
The atmosphere is super surfish, feels good. Highly recommend!"

I liked the garden, the location and the dogs. The rooms are basic, but if you travel light like a backpacker or surfer, they serve their purpose. There's a shared kitchen where there's American coffee available all day, and you can prepare whatever you want and store things in the fridge. The staff is lovely. The breakfasts are very tasty. Above all, what I missed was a wardrobe, even a simple one, and air conditioning. But I know the owners are working hard to improve it. Would I repeat? YES","This establishment is far from satisfactory. The cleanliness and basic amenities were sorely lacking.

The bathrooms were filthy, a glaring oversight that made the entire stay uncomfortable. Adding insult to injury, roosters crowing incessantly throughout the night disrupted any hope of rest, starting as early as 2 AM.

To make matters worse, the sheets provided seemed to have been washed in a dirty laundry, some even falling onto the ground outside and accumulating dirt. The pillows emitted unpleasant odours, indicating a lack of proper hygiene and care.

As if these issues weren't enough, dogs freely roamed into the restaurant, creating an unsanitary environment for guests trying to dine. Additionally, the absence of air conditioning in the sweltering heat only added to the discomfort.

The outdoor kitchen was no exception to the general state of neglect, appearing dirty and uncared for.

Overall, my experience was deeply disappointing. I urge the management to address these concerns promptly if they wish to salvage their reputation and provide a minimally acceptable level of service to their guests.","Amazing place to stay in Uluwatu! Everything worked out wonderful and all the people are so nice there! Thank you!

Could extend our stay there easily and we could rent a nice scooter as well!

Breakfast was a life saver every morning","Overpriced. Room/bathroom/bed standard is very low. And its my second month in Bali so I know standards and pricing here.
Smell of mold is intense.
Breakfast is good but small.
Kitchen and garden are the only things that really were on good level.
We found high standard hotel with clean white bed linen and A/C for just 2.50$/day more.
Not reccomending.","I only stayed one night, arrived very late, and left early, but from what I could see, it is a very nice, relaxed place to stay for a few days in Uluwatu.
It is a very cute place. Each villa has its own terrace,  screened by greenery. They make your breakfast to order so it's very fresh. You can make yourself tea or coffee in the open-air kitchen anytime you want, and also get water.
It was very hard to find, but it was late and very dark, not a lot of street lights in the neighbourhood.  But I think it would be a good base to explore Uluwatu.
The room was very simple, with basic facilities, and the mattress was very comfortable, and a good-sized double bed. Everything was very clean. Wifi was strong. The only niggle was the ceiling fan would only come on if you switched the light on, which you don't want when you are going to sleep. May be better to have separate switches for the fan and the light. As I arrived late, the reception desk was closed, but they left my name on a board outside the office, with my room number, so I knew which room was mine. The room is left open for you so you can go straight to your room when you arrive. The room key is in the room.
Overall, it was a great stay."

Very tasty and filling! Later we went for a swim. The pool was clean and refreshing. We only stayed 1 night, I think if you stayed longer, you'd need a scooter or something because it's located rather remotely.","We stayed at this hotel a week ago booked 2 rooms, arrived at approx 12.30am gates closed, no security, no information on rooms , my driver was trying all the numbers no answer from anyone. 2am we decided to pick a room asked for twin beds nothing was ready, so we had to just pick a room. Staff didn't really care had to tell them about the beds. No communication, staff not really experienced, asked for the manager never came for 4 days, sent a message on whats app but didnt tell us anything, advertised pool bar, it isn't open , couple rang day before and they told them it was, only 2 sun beds, cushions for the pool not there, broken. A/c was leaking, no water on the first day. No fridge or coffee making facilities. Dog came and urinated on the mat and cushions whilst I was sitting there. Told the staff member she just said oh!! No numbers for the rooms. Building going on next door, lights not working up the driveway at night. Property is too far away from everything. You need transport to go anywhere. Still no response back from anyone. Very poor service and very disappointing.","I am writing this review while staying in this hotel as I can’t fall asleep knowing that there’s cockroaches running around me. Besides this, there are other problems with the hotel room that I’m staying in. I’m staying in Room 7. First problem, room stays warm after turning on aircon at high speed and lowest degree possible. Second problem, sewage water leaking from toilet bowl and the water flow out of the bathroom into the bedroom and ponded under the open wardrobe next to the bathroom door. In addition, the co-working space is also warm despite the aircon at max speed and lower degree with fans on as well. Anyways back to the room. Those earlier mentioned problems was highlighted to the housekeeping. Aircon problem was highlighted an hour after check in, was told that the maintenance guy will drop by the next day but seems like nothing was done as room continue to stay warm with aircon on. Sewage water leakage was highlighted to housekeeping on the next day morning before we left the hotel to enjoy the sights of Uluwatu as we only spotted the problem in the morning while we prepare to head out. Housekeeping mentioned that will send the maintenance guy to check it out but seems like it wasn’t done hence why the sewage water flow out to the bedroom. Have contacted the hotel manager, Maria via WhatsApp about the problems. Pending her response. This review will remain until we get a satisfactory response from the manager. All we wanted is to enjoy our time in Bali but unfortunately run into such an incident at the hotel which affected our mood. However, that being said, we are thankful to the hotel security and kitchen staff for assisting us with the leakage so that we can continue to stay in the room for one more night which is tonight before we check out tomorrow. Can’t wait to check out tomorrow! Thanks for reading. Hope we won’t end our trip on a bad note! 🙏🏼  May god bless those who are checking into this room after us as we suspect those issues mentioned is not new for this room.","Rating Nagara 3 stars coz while I don't particularly dislike the place, it definitely did not list as a favourite.
💰However... If you're considering a place to suit a fair budget, then this can be the place!
🚙 Location is a short drive to the beaches, inclusive of breakfast and for us we appreciate that it's slightly secluded from the main road where there's more foot traffic.
🌴📸 The place really looks nice in photos.
🚪 Room interior is rustic modern but cleanliness can be improved.
🏊 No pool maintenance which was sad.","Very stylish and nice place. I think it’s better to stay short term. When you stay long term you see that you have stylish rooms but a not functional one at all.
- No window in the bathroom. That was horrible in any kind of way.
- Rooms are all side by side you literally hear every word from the neighbours and we had all the time drinking ones and annoyingly disrespectful ones so the walls were not fun at all.
- Doors have gaps completely open if you close them.
- No mosquito net and to many mosquitoes and bugs around. Why does no one care about that?
- The hotel is nearly a year open but just like the bed is important and already there, so should be a fridge. We have 35 degrees and it was an absolute no go to not have a fridge. - Cleaning was average and I did not like the way some workers got treated in front of customers."

We stayed here one night to go to Savaya and yes it's in an ok location but no I will not be coming back. The rooms and villas are big however the cleanliness is not okay. When we arrived we had to have an air freshener put in the main communal area because it smelt rotten. Everything was damp and sticky. Our sheets needed to be changed as they had brown and black marks over the pillow and bedding. The day beds, pool and floors were all extremely dirty also, I left here feeling like I needed a big shower. And as for the noises during the night... I was woken several times from roosters, frogs and motorbikes from the road just outside. Inside the rooms we had geckos, mosquitoes and little flies everywhere. For $290 a night, do not waste your money. I’m saying this, the workers are very helpful and nice but this place is run down… Someone else has mentioned this in a review but I have to agree, I believe bad reviews are being removed because this place is not 4.4 stars. Don’t waste your time","Stayed 4 nights in villa 107, 1 bedroom with private pool. Absolutely loved the place. Our breakfast was included and we made sure to try a range of options. The Dragon Fruit smoothie bowl was a favourite.
Staff were super friendly and always ready to help when needed. We did note the area wasn't as commercialised, but a quick gojek allowed us to easily visit all of Uluwatu.
We didn't have any issues with noise, although you could hear animals and traffic around.
Overall, a fantastic experience. Will definitely recommend.","I recently had an incredible stay at Mahagiri Villas Dreamland. The luxurious accommodations, breathtaking views, and impeccable service truly exceeded my expectations. The staff went above and beyond to make my birthday unforgettable, surprising me with a delicious cake that added a personal touch to my already amazing experience.

The location is good you are 15 mins to any beach. So you are in the center. However,
pretty small rooms. no closet, beds are uncomfortable. But i thought that it should not be a big issue cause there is a big garden. But there is constant construction noise. Everyday, including weekend… i heard they will also build some extra bungalows. So more construction is guaranteed.  Plus, the staff, the owner, the manager, they use the common spaces as their office. not much room for you.

The manager (Desi) is very nice and doing her best to compensate for the trouble the construction is bringing. You will also be able to spot the owner who is living in one of the rooms and not so friendly (would never say hi to you for instance

So if you have some space left for yourself from the management and also the construction feel free to enjoy yourself.

Its in the village btw. So its away from the chaos and the main street. But it means a lot of roosters screaming as of 05:00 am :)
For this price you can find much better and comfortable rooms. the bed was a disaster and if you are too people, no way you can sleep in the room.","10/10 stay!

Also advised the manager to work on their desserts, very small selection, and their brownies are sometimes dry. Also would like the staff to pay attention to the pancakes, because they are very bland, tasteless, maybe change the recipe😅🤷🏻‍♀️

I can suggest a good recipe for pancakes:

Eggs - 2 pcs.
Milk - 250 ml (1 cup)
Water (boiling water) - 250 ml (1 cup)
Vegetable oil - 3 tbsp. spoons
Flour - 200 g
Sugar - 3 tbsp.
Salt - 0.5 tsp.","Breakfast in this place is amazing! Big portions, tasty, good ingredients for a vgood price. Additionally the waiters and the owner are very friendly and speak English fluently. We went there to eat breakfast on-site and also ordered home delivery with Grab (they packed it so well). Highly recommended place!","Disappointing smoothie bowl, no flavor and was more foam like in texture. Super cheap / cheapest matcha I’ve see. Tasted ok.","fall for the reviews. BIG mistake.
You get what you pay for:
Coffee - so much robusta in the blend (
Fruit bowl with avocado - debatable.
Pancakes - no more available (Apr24), only wraps with filling.
Meal from a kitchen maid with respective realization.
Open kitchen should include great ventilation, however it's not the case here and smells of burning is all around.","Great coffee, super friendly atmosphere and affordable price! Definitely one of the best breakfast place in the Bukit! Dian and her team will make you feel like at home ☺️"

The ordering process is a little time consuming as there are so many options but it's well worth the effort.
The portion size is huge and the price is very affordable. The staff are also super friendly. Highly recommended."

The rooms are really cozy and authentic, the surrounds are super green and you have a great view of the ocean from the lookout point. The staff were super friendly and helpful. Because it’s so central you can basically reach any beach or go to Uluwatu in under 20 mins by scooter. Looking forward to coming back!","Amazing peaceful hotel. We stayed for 2 days for new year.

Agnes is such a nice server and always gives us a good laugh.","I love their food!! Definitely recommended.
I think they serve one of the best Thai foods in town.","This place is awesome, i never imagine their red curry and omelette will be this yummy.

All those reviews must be a fraud.

Three people ate their „amazing“ red tuna steak - three people got fish poisoning!!!

Furthermore it was the worst fish we‘ve had in 4 weeks of being around Bali.

Every Warung has more ambiente than this place.

Seating is horrible, annoying western chart music and plenty of barking and free-running dogs INSIDE the place.

Menu says „tax and service included“ but when asking the waiter if prices have included service it turns out the owner of the place just keeps it all!

Worst eatery (I just can‘t call it a restaurant) I‘ve seen in many years.

Go there and enjoy some days inside your bathroom afterwards.","The best wagyu stake you can eat in jimbaran. The price is really affordable also, around 200k for a 300grams steak.
I really recommend it.","Request to the owners - please add another side like mashed or baked or boiled potatoes or grilled vegetables.
Otherwise the meat is good.
And adding red wine to the menu might also make sense.
Basically just learn from Chimichurri - they do everything right except your meat is better.

Thanks to management for a quick reply.
I asked and was told that only French fries for the side. Grilled vegetables only as a separate dish. I visited today.","Very tasty BEEF STEAK, best i ever had in Bali for sure. The plate comes with home made fries very jummy also and a very simple salad. Very quiet place. Clean and nice staff. Ohh and the best at all: COLD beer, really cold!"

Seating area is also available, price is pretty good for the quality you get.
