Usually come here for breakfasts. The menu is not very big, but you can find a dish to any taste. The view is beautiful","I have been Volken's regular, one of the best coffee in Bali.

Been in love with Volken's coffee for a long time, Torst took it to another new level. Because here we have food selection and all we tried are really good. And the place itself is next to a rice field which is very beautiful.

The internet is also quite good, nice place for working or hang out with family and friends.

Love this place so much!"

There was 8 of us in total so we had plenty of space. It is away from the hustle and bustle so suited us nicely. Rooms were spacious and clean with air con units in each room. Loved the hot showers! Vera and the team were so awesome and friendly. Very helpful when we had last minute requests and quick to respond. We had arranged our own driver for the week but you will need a scooter or driver to get around if you are to stay here which they can also help you with. We really enjoyed the pool and the big kitchen which had everything you needed. We did order the breakfast offered at the villa on our last day and it was amazing and scrumptious! It exceeded our expectations. Highly recommend this villa for big groups. Suksema Vera and team. We will definitely be back.,"Wow, what a fantastic way to end our stay in Bali. The Devan guesthouse has comfortable beds, large rooms with good natural light, it‚Äôs very clean and the shower is HOT. The location is out of the way but easy to access using a scooter. Really wish we had more time here!","Location is a bit out of the busy areas.
Room was clean but no kettle or fridge or TV.
All those are located in the common area which includes a share kitchen with equipment free to use to cook. As well as a fridge.
I would have given a better rating if the bed frame wasn't making so much noise when moving.
And the outside noise with roosters and ducksn not to mention barkjng dogs, very loud most of the night.
So forget about the quiet place to sleep.
I guess it is hard to avoid in little remote areas with locals around.","I really like a quiet place with clean and cool air, blue sky, white clouds, far from road noise, you have to have your own vehicle if you stay at devan guest house, we rented all the rooms at devan guest house for 3 nights and really enjoyed this place","love the place, peaceful and quiet but a little far to get to main road"

We wanted a relaxing week away, so didn't really focus on excursions or going out an about much. We therefore wanted a large, modern space, a big swimming pool and the ability to have great food all within the villa.

Sika and his team created a fantastic experience for us, the food prepared by the chef was restaurant quality and the villas setting was perfect.

We would strongly recommend a stay if you're looking for luxury & relaxation in Bali.","What a holiday! We stayed at Palm House over the Christmas/New Year period ‚Ä¶ nothing was too much trouble for the wonderful team led by Sika. From sourcing baby requirements, finding specific food & drink requests, hosting Christmas lunch for additional family & friends, organising day trips etc we were completely looked after and every need met. The accommodation is stunning with beautiful big bedrooms & en-suites, cinema/entertainment room, small gym, fantastic outdoor areas and a wonderful indoor eating area which was invaluable on those hot humid nights especially with a young baby. Amazing chefs who catered to specific dietary requirements & awesome food!! The Villa is in Canguu which, during busy periods,  may take a little longer to get to other places on the island but build this in to your plans and relax! We would highly recommend the villa which is absolutely beautiful and also the team of personnel who make your stay there perfect with 5* service. I want to go every year !! ‚ù§Ô∏è","Absolutely wonderful place to stay. The villa itself is extremely well equipped and well kept, with plenty of room to rest and relax. You can easily find your own nook with nobody around, or you can congregate and hang out with everyone you're there with in one spot!

The staff are wonderful people always willing to assist and make your stay as comfortable as they can! Sika, the manager, was a great deal of help with our wedding, as well as sorting out anything that we needed at the drop of a hat! He went above and beyond to make our stay great, and all of our guests staying with us thought as such too!

If I could move in there full time, I would!!","The villa itself is great! There are 5 bedrooms + 1 bedroom for kids with bunkbeds. There is game & cinema room, a small gym, big pool, and nice dining area. Also lots of spaces for activities. Staffs are super nice, friendly, and very helpful. There are Sonos sound systems inside the villa. (But sound wise, i prefer Bose or other systems - since sonos require you to connect via sonos apps). Quite complete set of kitchen utensils, so cooking or preparing fooda are nice in the villa.

However there are big minuses:
1. Lots of bugs & small animals since it is in the middle of nowhere. We found spiders in many places, gecko, small flies, mosquitoes, and different kind of bugs.
2. Access to the villa is very poor. Small & very narrow alley. Parking spots also very few, i think can only accommodate 4 cars. Quite far for other places like restaurants & others in Canggu area.
3. Wifi is slow for multiple connections. We have about 12 people connecting to the wifi, and it was barely usable. If 2-3 persons connect, i think it will be okay. But this villa has 6 rooms, right?
4. Limited amenities. No slippers, shaving kits, etc. They only provide soap & shampoo, and towels.

With the price per night this high, i don't think it is worth staying here. Unless you are looking for a place to get together for 10+ people in 1 venue, there are better choices out there in the area.","This breathtaking villa will leave you speechless. The rooms, the pool and the sheer vastness is the space is so unexpected when you‚Äôre right in the middle of farm fields.

Sika (the villa manager) runs a tight ship and the staff are all lovely, attentive and can‚Äôt do enough for you - from making off-the-menu cocktails to dashing out at a moment‚Äôs notice for last-minute requests.

Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough!"

We had view to the pool, it is a quiet place, with space where you can park your scooter. They have a restaurant too at food is very delicious and they have very good prices. The communication was smooth, they answer fast.

But, I have to talk about the not so good part too. On outside walls we saw a lot of cicaks (a kind of lizard), and the problem is that they can get inside the rooms too. In 3 days we had 3 cicaks in our room. I know that they can't hurt us, but we hate the feeling that they can accidentally get on us anytime.

In our 1 month stay in Bali it was our best looking accommodation, but every time when we think about this place we remember the cicaks too.","Loved this place , it‚Äôs super well managed , quiet , peaceful and the real Bali vibe üå¥üôèüèºüíú",Perfect üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I loved the miso soup that I came back the next day for it. I can tell the fish is pretty fresh. I enjoyed the salmon cheese roll and the salmon avocado roll. I usually get nigiri sushi, but I decided to try their rolls out. I think the salmon avocado roll was cut too thick, as I prefer the bite size a little smaller like the cheese roll I had. The service was great. The ladies working their are friendly and very sweet. I will definitely come again for some more miso soup and delicious rolls.","I am not a fan of raw fish, so I love that Kaemon also does sushi with cooked ingredients. My favourites are the spicy seared salmon aburi roll and the crispy chicken roll. I also love the soba noodle dishes and will definitely be back very soon to try their chicken katsu curry. Their location is also lovely in the peaceful area of Tumbak Bayuh. I suggest eating upstairs. My husband and I will definitely be back soon, and we will probably try their other location right on Echo Beach the next time it looks like there will be a good sunset.","the first time in my life, I cried over food. literally cried. what a waste of food. beef yakiniku, i dont know if its the authentic recipe or what but for me miso paste was too much. beef meat was covered with miso paste and taste like peanut with beef, just imagine. then I ordered teriyaki beef, way too salty. I understand its contained soy sauce and supposedly bit salty, but I couldn‚Äôt tolerate the saltiness of this beef teriyaki. couldn‚Äôt even finish all of that yakiniku beef and teriyaki beef.
service is good. its just the food I ordered, was a disappointment for me. Kaemon was my favorite for sushi. I thought they will amazed me with non sushi food, surprisingly not. now I am supper sad

maybe for sushi i might come again. but other than that, no no","I read one review mentioning the food being mediocre which I think is an overstatement. There are other places with better tasting food that worth the price.

I should agree with another review saying he/she cried over his/her order. Because I did as well.

They need to do better.","Enjoyed dinner here after wanting to visit for years after the Echo Beach cafe closed.
Sat upstairs and was welcomed with my little dog, lovely cool breeze was welcomed!
Attentive staff and quick service. Great pricing.
Enjoyed very much the starters of edamame, agedashi tofu, gomae greens, karagae, butter potato.
Was a joy to revisit one of my favourite Japanese cafes. Thankyou!"

I only regret that we booked this villa for a month and not for our entire stay on Bali.

The facilities of the villa make it suitable for both remote-working and vacation. Video calls never stuttered and might have been more crisp than at home. We loved the different trees and plants in the garden, and the fact that the garden is completely enclosed so you have complete privacy.

The villa is located just outside of Canggu, a quiet location. In about 5 min you‚Äôre at Batu Bolong, and 10 min to get to the beach. If you‚Äôre into Padel, like us, there are four courts just 3min away. And,‚Ä¶ just around the corner you can find Warung Fajar, which has the best Nasi Goreng we managed to find on the Island.

In short: we‚Äôll be back! Thanks for having us Ady.","Pros:
‚Äìowner was polite and bring welcome coconut
‚Äìrooms quite nice, price is good
‚Äìmight be ok for a short stay

Main con:
‚ÄìGUESTS ARE NOT ALLOWED AT ALL even during the day, we've known that only after invited friends for the first time to have dinner. Owner came at 8 pm ask everyone to go home. We had some local friends and they agreed that's it is nonsense, but the evening was ruined.
On the next day he told us if it happens again he will ""throw us away"" (as he messaged to our neighbours) We decided to move on the next day.

Other Cons:
‚Äìowner didn't answered for one week, and didn't replace some lamps and did not fix the drain that flooded the door to the room during the rain
‚Äìlied to us about construction nearby which worked every day including weekends (it's classic but many owners here in Bali play fair)
‚Äìlied about internet speed (we changed provider and fixed it)
‚Äìterrible soundproofing, if you sit in the kitchen you can hear every word of your neighbours, and they can hear yours,
‚Äìwe broke one cheep glass and use small towel to clean the glass owner tried to charge us 500 for this, and he didn't have a list with prices. But later he agreed on 150.

There are many really good owners in Bali, we haven't any problems within several years. So hope this review might be useful.","Beautiful private villa and pool, with amazing outdoor/open bathroom and also living area. The service was perfect, so friendly and very accommodating. They were happy to help you with anything, as long as you enjoyed your stay! Definitely the best place we stayed in all of our time in Bali.","Stayed here for almost two weeks in August in the family villa. After we had already stayed in 4 different villas before staying here on our trip, all of we were amazing. So its sad that Pandan was a bit of a let down. To start off with here, we were taken aback by the staff who weren't friendly at all. If anything a little bit rude. No hi how are you today or welcome, we arrived by them putting a bill in front of our faces and demanding payment for the rest of the villa stay after we had already transferred 70% of the cost in the weeks leading (Which was more than the deposit they were requesting) - $250AUD a night. Within hours of checking in and unwinding, we realised that there is two starving angry cats (a mother and a baby) inclosed in our gated villa and living near the pool pump (and im a cat person, but these cats were angry). They were meowing for hours and we thought they must be hungry and gave them some milk, but still they shouldn't be in our villa. I had then read a previous review about someone saying the same. I then went to the reception for the girl to rudely tell me that they are wild cats and this is Bali and that is not their problem. I told her I have spent 8 months in Bali and know some people that can take the cats away and rehome then. She didn't listen. So throughout our holiday stay we had to listen to constant meowing all night ever night, the cats sneaking in our bins, on the kitchen tables when we eat. We tried leaving the front door open to get them out but nothing. The actual villas are nice, but I definitely would not recommend staying here, everything else is a total let down. In both villa rooms, there is was no hand soap in the dispenser from the time we got there. I had to go and ask reception if they could fill up the soap dispensers for our stay. I have never had to ask that at any place I have stayed at in Bali. Never again will I stay at pandan villas"

The food was amazing, we went twice for breakfast and once for dinner. We definitely recommend trying the berry smoothie bowl!! Was really tasteful! Sourdough bread here is amazing! Overall a 10 outta 10, we assume the owner stayed here at the same time as us, and must be Australian , we thought we‚Äôd seen him passby a few times. We just wanted to say: he did an amazing job on this hotel and kitchen. Cheerios to you ! üôè If we could we would‚Äôve loved to stay longer but due to a busy schedule we had to head to our next stop. Which is nearby , so there‚Äôs a big chance of us paying another visit in the next days for breakfast or Lunch ! Surely give them a try, loads of vegan options, nice seating area, great pool, 10 outta 10 !
Lots of love,

This spot is like an oasis of calm where you're surrounded by rice fields and a beautiful pool. The lunch itself was served in a beautiful traditional joglo and all the dishes we had came out fresh and tasty. All 5 star from us!!","DO NOT GO THERE with a dog! we unfortunately saw the ""not pet friendly"" at the last minute on the front door, but it was too late and their female dog attacked ours immediately. Then their dog followed us on the parking lot and suddenly attacked violently our dog again. She bit my husband when he tried to remove our small dog from her grip. it was very noisy but no one came to check on us. heading to the hospital now...

Update : To answer your reply, I am very surprised that you try to justify yourself and just put the blame on us. Yes we saw the sign but it was too late, and we were just discussing with your staff for 1 minute when your dog attacked ours. didn't even had time to realize what was happening. and if you have the footage, then you know very well that we left right away, and were very aggressively attacked on the parking lot. I have no issue with you wanting to have your pets on your facilities, but you should inform clearly that they are very aggressive , and it was not the case when we came for the first time.
And I am sorry to say that no, your dog Bunny is not amazing at all, it is the first time in 5 years in Bali that my husband got bitten by a dog, so that doesn't sound like an amazing animal AT ALL. Anyway I am glad that you now decided to put it clearly to prevent any other incident in a village where many people do also have pets, and ask for nothing but a peaceful experience when they go out for a coffee. I will happily remove this review when you update your road sign and put clearly that the place is not pet friendly (since this is your sign road that randomly brought us to your place, without knowing what we were about to experience....). Because yes, your PRIORITY should be FIRST the SAFETY of anyone stopping by your place. All the best.","We had a 3 days stay near this restaurant so we ate here repeatedly. Every time we was satisfied.

In our one month stay in Bali it was the best food for the money we paid.","The food was amazing, the staff was so friendly
The best place pool with the ricefield view"

I met a community there and made some lasting friendships. Plus the rooms and facilities are gorgeous. I recommend it to all my friends who come into town. Can't wait to visit again!,"Really enjoyed my one month stay here, Kris and Novita were very hospitable, we had a nice home cooked dinner movie night in the garden with all the guest the week before I left. Room was clean and cleaning staff made up the room and replaced the sheets regularly. There's also a super convenient fridge thats always stocked with refreshments¬†and alcohol (there's a fee of course), but it beats going to the convenience store when you just want a quick drink to relax.

Bonus if you're a cat person, Brock the house cat kept me company and he's super friendly.

Highly recommended for short or long term stays!","Stayed here for 2 months. Would call the owner (Novita) a terrible business woman. Charging unfair prices for rooms that are not cleaned properly. What the cleaners did do, was steal our money. Owner did not compensate but chose to stall for time or deny instead. Refused to even apologize for 1000+ usd in good and value stolen but got aggresive instead.

Believe the bad reviews, not the good ones.","Canggu Hive was a great experience. The host Novita is wonderful, very helpful and kind as well as the other staff working there. The place it self is perfect, nice, clean and comfortable room's. A big swimming pool and a great kitchen where you can make a nice meal together with the other guests if you're tired of fried rice. I only booked 2 days because i was planning to go somewhere else. I ended up staying in Canggu Hive for the whole week.

I will come back!","Probably the worst accommodation I‚Äôve stayed in canggu, owner Novita considers herself a ‚Äúbusiness women‚Äù but her English boyfriend support her while being very rude and unprofessional, and the manager Kirsty does nothing but is also rude to most customers.  Accommodation is horrible, beds uncomfortable, room smells like urine and when I asked for a refund told me rudely I don‚Äôt get one. Didn‚Äôt even ask why I wanted one. Highly advise to avoid this very amateur accommodation with so many better ones in the area with better location, rooms and management."
