We recommend to order tipical Nasi Goreng or fried duck. And if you take a dessert, try the banana and chocolate. It was so nice!! Our waitress was very kind and give us really good service. We stayed on there for a while because it was rainy and we have good time together. Thank you for everything.","IIGA is an unexpected gem! We stumbled upon this restaurant on our way to Amed from Taman Ujung, and it turned out to be a fantastic find. From the moment we arrived, we were warmly greeted by two incredibly friendly staff members.

The restaurant boasts a sprawling garden with a truly relaxing ambiance. It's the perfect place to unwind and enjoy a meal. Speaking of which, the food here is nothing short of amazing. We ordered the Nasi Goreng, Sate Lilit, and Iga Sapi, and each dish was a delightful culinary experience.

The drinks were fresh and delicious, complementing the flavors of our meal perfectly. However, the real highlight of our visit was when one of the staff members invited us to pick mangosteens from the tree. It was a delightful surprise and added an extra layer of fun to our dining experience.

In summary, IIGA is a hidden treasure that we wholeheartedly recommend. The friendly staff, beautiful garden setting, mouthwatering food, and unexpected surprises like picking mangosteens make this place a must-visit. We can't wait to return!","It was one of the best Warungs I've been to. 3 minutes drive from Lempuyang tour drop-off location. Food is delicious and served tastefully. Place is surrounded by fruit trees, which creates a peaceful environment.",The food is delicious and the prices are fair. The staff are very friendly and they give good services. The places are very beautiful and clean. We are very happy to go there.,This was perfect. Best warung I have been to. The staff were so nice. The gardens around the warung were like a botanical garden. Definitely come here.
