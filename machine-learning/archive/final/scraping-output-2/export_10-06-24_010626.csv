Nothing on this menu disappoints and every meal is served with the highest standards of preparation and presentation","I must say, the best all-you-can-eat experience in Bali! The food is amazing, the staff are incredibly nice and responsive, and the ambiance is fantastic! Whether you prefer to dine without alcohol or enjoy a drink of your choice, they cater to all preferences. It was my first time trying hot-served all-you-can-eat, and I was pleasantly surprised; every dish was prepared meticulously and served beautifully. While the desserts were just okay for my taste buds, the savory dishes didn't disappoint at all. They are serving fresh watermelon juice too!","This place is amazing. The best food, the best staff, and all very reasonably priced. Had my birthday here, and I can only say, I'll never forget it. The club is an awesome place to be after dinner. Highly recommended.","Speechless. I had so many people tell me to visit here for dinner and I‚Äôm glad I did. They have one of the best if not the best Sushi all you can eat offering I have ever seen, along with soft drinks included. The cost is $30 USD PP, after that head up to the nightclub for an open 2 hour bar.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys fine Japanese Sushi‚Äôs and seafood.","If you want to experience a fine dining with in affordable way, you may want to come here. The all you can eat have lot of delicious dish, my favourite was the tenderloin steak and the the cod fish. They will let you order 3 menu in each order until the next 2 hours.

The staff are also very nice and friendly. No complaints all around, I‚Äôd definitely recommend a visit here.","Vegan heaven. We ordered the Mac burger. Basically a sauce soup. The patty consistency fell apart instantly. You are basically eating a bowl of drenched burger items with a fork. Flavor wise it was ok but they have to work on the consistency of the patty. It wasn‚Äôt a pleasant experience.

Second item we ordered was a Buddha bowl. Nice ingredients but it‚Äôs missing a biding agent to unite everything in a bowl. Most non vengan places use cheese or some type of sauce to do this. Since it‚Äôs vegan they should find a replacement that harmonizes the bowl.

The atmosphere was nice. Outdoor and indoor seating. Drinks bar , attentive staff. Hip guests.","Such a cute, trendy vegan spot with a huge menu to choose from! I was so pleased with my order and presentation of food is just beautiful! The staff were fantastic and friendly! I loved the strawberry matcha latte!","Our family is not vegan, but we came here for Thursday 50k Rupiah Pasta Night, plus their kids' menu, and we were blown away. From the coloring table they set up for our toddler, to the big portions and shockingly delicious vegan dishes - we left so happy and stuffed. Will come back again. It was a great healthy place for kids in Bali.","We will be back again and again! That says it all, firstly the staff are amazing and super friendly and welcoming. The food is 11/10 delicious! Being a vegan we have struggles to find certain foods for ourselves and our baby. You can buy alternative milk and food there. We have stocked up and will be back for the atmosphere!

We got the big breakfast, English breakfast and drinks"

The first thing that caught my eye was the modern architecture and design of the interior. The use of green plants and mirrors created a refreshing and spacious atmosphere. The outdoor seating area, adorned with pink flowers, offered a charming spot to enjoy the Bali weather.

The array of baked goods on display was impressive. Each item looked fresh and inviting. The cafe seemed to offer a variety of choices, catering to different tastes and dietary preferences.

The staff were friendly and attentive, adding to the overall positive experience. The service was prompt, and the food and drinks arrived at the table looking just as good as they tasted.

Parking and entrance accessibility were also available, making it convenient for customers with vehicles or those requiring wheelchair access.

Overall, 32do Bali offers a wonderful cafe experience with its inviting ambiance, wide selection of baked goods, and excellent service. It's a place worth visiting when in Bali.","Korean themed cafe in Bali. The queue is extremely long as it gets busier at noon. But once you get inside, cool design! Pastries are great. Price also consider affordable for a cafe like this. Staffs are super friendly!","The queues are extraordinarily long and super hot at certain times. It can be 1,5 hours to 2 hours queue. It is quite understandable from the owner's response in google, why they didn't add additional tables inside considering that there is still plenty of space for dine-in, which in fact is to maintain the comfort of visitors. The coffee is quite good. Meanwhile, almost all of the pastries are delicious. We also take away the pastry even though we have to queue again üò¨üò¨ Overall it was quite enjoyable at 32do but maybe I would think again if I had to go there and queue again üòùüòù Hopefully in the future we won't have to queue for too long.","I recently visited 32do and had a delightful experience. The cafe offers a wide variety of freshly baked pastries that are both delicious and beautifully presented. Their coffee is equally impressive, with rich flavors and a perfect balance that caters to all coffee lovers.

The ambiance of the cafe is cozy and welcoming, making it an ideal spot for both casual meet-ups and solo relaxation. One notable aspect of 32do is their exceptionally clean toilets, which is a refreshing and important feature for any cafe.

Overall, 32do is a fantastic place to enjoy high-quality pastries and coffee in a pleasant and hygienic environment. Highly¬†recommended!","Coffee is good. Pastry is great. Design is modern.

But I feel there are still more room of improvements for this cafe.

I am not really sure why customers need to wait and stand outside of the cafe under the sun where obviously no lines inside the cafe. Why not using inside area of the cafe to give better experience for the customer?

Staff are not very flexible to accommodate the customer needs. I was in a group of 4 and there are 2 free tables for 2 people. But we can‚Äôt combine the tables. Why? Estetique over customer satisfaction? ü§î"

I love that you're right at the doorstep of so much happening around you but seem so tucked away and like you're in an actual resort. Total value for money. The breakfast is delicious with a range of options but doesn't feel overwhelming or pretentious. The staff were definitely a highlight.

My stay experience:
First, i was greeted by a weird statement from the receptionist that my additional booking wasn't confirmed as they are fully booked and i might have to change room (i made 2 separate bookings as i decided to stay in seminyak for an extra day and it was confirmed by the booking app). I was confused by that statement, but later, a senior receptionist made sure that the additional booking was confirmed and assured me that i didn't have to change the room.

The room was clean but a bit dark and not maintained well as the sink and the bathtub did not drain properly. The phone wasn't working either.

Later at night, i noticed the hotel was located next to one of the busiest club. The soundproofing was adequate, but didn't 100% fully reduce the noise.

Woke up to a construction noise from next to the hotel. Wish we were told about it.","I am currently staying here and cant speak highly enough of all the staff, they are so lovely and helpful, our favourite receptionist is the young lady who always has the biggest smile when greeting us. She is an asset to you.
I was staying in a room with a pool view, which I wouldn't recommend, and every night we could hear the nightclub. I requested to be moved, and the hotel did this with no problems.
The beds are so comfy and the pillows I want to take home.
I love the treats they leave in your room in the evening, very thoughtful.
We will be staying here again.","We loved our stay here! It‚Äôs central and you can walk out the door to heaps of restaurants. The bed was massive and so comfortable!

Advertised to have a restaurant & room service‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt.
The elevator doesn‚Äôt work. Makes carrying luggage up and down stairs a chore.
The first room i checked into had no power so had to move to another room.
The rooms are tired with signs of wear eg, bathroom tiles shed this thin layer of crusty film that was like a snake shedding skin.","Fair hotel for money, quite few faults and could do with make over. Safe in our room didn't work, was lock shut and could be opened, probably only needs new battery.

But on positive side, cleaner did a good a job as possible, staff were helpful and security guys were always pleasant.","Honestly i thought the hotel would be okay from the reviews. So heres my honest review:

1. The room itself is old and the management didnt even care to have their rooms maintained properly. Why i say this? Many reviews mentioned about the rooms quality and yet they didnt maintain it eitherway.

Room Details:
- Moldy
- Walls needs repair
- Unpleasant odor by the toilet
- Bidet wasnt working properly
- Hot water wasnt working well, so you can probably get warm water (maybe different from other room)
- Stains on the bed sheet & pillow sheet (blood)
- The beed is creeking whenever you move
- Pillow is hard and uncomfortable
- Possibly dusty/unsanitary room (since im allergic to dust and i got a reaction when i slept here)
- Shower rug is VERY THIN, when you use it once after shower its fully wet. So i'd recommend asking for extra rug

2. The location is a bit tight for those who travel with car, at night the road is dark and the parking space is very limited so keep that in mind if you are going on high season

3. For the service, so far i've only met the front desk since i only stayed for one night (thankfully). So i couldn't say much for the service

OVERALL: Bad, and i wont be coming back here. There are still multiple choices with similar prices nearby that i feel like its way better than Alea comparing to other budget hotels ive stayed here in Bali.","Rooms are not too spacious but cozy, prime locations but gets traffic in the weekend, and the price are good..","Enjoyable experince to stay here.

The food is great, the staffs are friendly and they also got spa in here (which has a really good price). Will definitely come back!","Lovely staff and a nice enough breakfast. By far the noisiest and loudest hotel I have ever stayed in! Rooms overlooking villas echoing noise as well as adjoining hollow doors so your neighbours may as well be in bed with you. Every footstep above and bellow is madness. ( I know I sound it but no, I am not a wingy old git) The rooms are in need of an upgrade but are spacious and clean. If you‚Äôre going to be up and out on it all night then it‚Äôs the place for you.
Happy travels","Not a great hotel. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived so decided to lounge be the pool. Issued with stripey towels that was the last time they were available very odd!
The rooms had only a wardrobe no other cupboards. The balcony overlooked other eatablishment s, all we saw were canopies covering pools. Too small to sit on but no chair to sit on  anyway.
The bathroom was weird as it had a large window looking into the bedroom area. We found a blind but it was dirty and covered in mould.  The bath mat was not nice to stand on very grey.
Beware of the pool , there are no handrails anywhere.
The worst thing were the towels dark grey! Presumably white at some point in there lives.
The shop was never open.
The Pool bar was never open.
It was a half hour drive into Seminyak Village and also a 30-40 walk to the beach.
Don't go anywhere near this hotel.",My flight got cancelled and i had a stay in this hotel. It is an amazing hotel with all the good facilities and the staff is very helpful and friendly.

I used to be a regular visitor at their amazing Bangkok outlet (no longer open), and that place was a stunner ... the Bali outlet is even a notch more in decoration (super creative and attentive to detail) and overall ambiance.

The service was very friendly and helpful, cannot fault the team.  The drink menu extensive and the food enough to the point (a few mpre items would be welcome if ever possible).

It should be on the list of ""must-stop"" for visitors to the island and a ""regular joint"" to the residents.","This is a place to get entertained that sells food and creative alcoholic drinks. The most entertaining was the interior design. It was like the ex-Edison in LA with lot more timid entertainment.

The food is ok if you need something to line your stomach in preparation for the drinks. The drinks were fun and they have enough to satisfy most palate.

The service was good, prompt, responsive. They were well staffed.

The space itself ‚Ä¶ fantastic to have this in Bali.","If you are looking for a one of a kind, unique and immersive bar experience in Bali, you might want to check out this medieval concept industrial style bar, a stunning fusion of design and ambiance. Just opened at the end of November 2023, Ashley Sutton brings the intricate, otherworldly design of Iron Fairies brand to Bali. His bar designs are world renowned for the industrial, secret lair vibes that transport you away to a different world.
The bar features a large mechanical wheel structure adorned with light bulbs, moving gears, and metalwork, creating a striking contrast with the stone walls and wooden furniture. The live music is eclectic and lively. The service is friendly and attentive, making you feel welcome and comfortable. The cocktail is also delicious. Whether you are looking for a romantic date night, a fun night out with friends, or a solo adventure, this bar will not disappoint you. It is a hidden gem in Bali that you have to see for yourself. Free entry for the bar and standing, and there's minimum charge for the table. Come after 10 PM after the live music starts as they turn the vibes on. The parking area is a bit limited though, and the area is notorious for traffic, so opting for ride hailing taxi is your best bet.","Words can't accurately describe how breathtaking this place is.

Everywhere you look there's something amazing and unique to discover.

Service is fast and courteous, great selection of bespoke cocktails and great live music on the night we attended.

A truely unique experience and must do when visiting Bali."

The hotel itself is run down and needs a lot maintenance, mould in the rooms, sheets and pillowcases smell and stained. Nothing smells fresh . The staff are super friendly and make you feel very welcome but I guess that‚Äôs their job . The hotel is more about cramming people in for the $$$$$.
The hotel is noisy. Had to bash on an adjoining door to tell the people in the next room to be quiet at 2am after we were told by reception we were in a quiet part of the hotel.
The garden pool area is now full of extra rooms crammed into what was the wedding reception room area, the toilet and shower room at poolside is now a one bed villa room. The hotel has lost all of its charm.
Breakfast here is now sub standard with hardly a wide selection you see in other hotels. We have stayed here before and thought we would come back again only to be very disappointed. The only thing this hotel has is its location and fabulous staff.","The location is perfect, Staffs are very friendly. Best thing about this hotel is you can swim till late also for food and beverage, they don't charge tax and service fee. Their breakfast is limited but the quality is better than many 5star hotels. I agree they need to do some maintenance especially rooms. Aircon is either too cold or not cold, drain is not working well. Bedsheets are a bit stinky and not that dry.
Anyway, i would like to come back. If you don't stay in the room much, it's  a perfect place for you.","Thank you to the staff that took care of us in our 3 day visit, Ade at reception and Ivan in breakfast service. Rooms are clean, easy access, location of resort very central. There are 3 pools, one of the pools had started building a bit of mold (we only used it once) except for that it was a great stay. The breakfast had so much variety and very yummy üòã","Let‚Äôs start on a positive note.  Staff are absolutely amazing and so friendly.  Location is great, close to downtown Seminyak, beach, restaurants and Beach Clubs.
We have previously stayed here and could not fault anything.
Not this time.  We tried to rent the room we previously stayed in - Serenity Villa with balcony.  Now they have changed the Wedding Pavilion to accommodation, the family rooms at the back to open accommodation with balconies, and the toilet also is now accommodation.  Not the quiet area it used to be.
So much mould everywhere - on the edges of the pools, which also have broken tiles, on the daybed cushions, on the pool floating beanbags,  disgusting.  Day beds are broken with pieces missing as did our balcony outdoor setting.
Pool towels and bath towels are stained (yuck).   Bathrooms have stains on the counter tops and mould in the showers.
Rooms are super noisy.  Cleaning each day is hit and miss.  We had to call yesterday as room still not cleaned at 4pm.
Also ordered a toasted sandwich to be sent to our room.  Nearly 4 hours later it had still not arrived.  They then called saying they were trying to call me all afternoon.  They weren‚Äôt.  I don‚Äôt appreciated untruths.
From once giving this resort basically a 11/10 I am now struggling to give it a one star.
So much maintenance needed everywhere.  Paint patches on walls which do not match.  A mix match of repairs on paths and everywhere.  So sad, that is has gone so far down in a few years.","The hospitality is great, the location is amazing, the staff is polite and attentive, what i do not like is that the rooms are not properly cleaned and hygiene standards are not followed - we stayed 9 days and each day you can see only the bed being made, they will not dust or mop even the toilet. They bring stained but clean towels, the sewage smells, and in general, this is the only off about the hotel, otherwise, its the best given its location and employees being kind and attentive. The breakfast is good, has enough items and there is a good service too."

So, I have been livin' in bali basically all my life. I came here tonight with my bestfriends that i have known for like years and years. We had so much fun before coming to red ruby, well or so we thought we were gonna have fun here after all the places we were at beforehand. UNFORTUNATELY, SO many aggressive girls (but they are boys) = (NOT judging by the way but that's just truth) - trying to Fight with me and one of them keep throwing her drink üçπ on my face a few times also giving the F you signs with her finger and pushing me and I didn't even do anything I got scared there‚Äôs 4 of them!

NOT LOVIN IT, nobody is helping me. SECURITY GUARDS DID NOT do ANYTHING at ALL. Some of my guy friends all felt uncomfortable and obviously so did I, so I just left.

DISAPPOINTED. MANAGER and OWNER NEED TO DO something Fast about this Aggressiveness Territorial girls in there ASAP!

Few fights happening here lately night many times where some of the security do not really do much (bad behavior themselves)

PS to manager: GO AHEAD WATCH THE CCTV AND YOU WILL See .

Oh and just to be Super Clear I am not homophobic I am not against the LGBT community or anything  (I have lgbt friends okay) but I just do not appreciate people in general disrespecting others especially when they are minding their own business and privacy.

Not all security are bad there but definitely need to be well trained (some of them) and also the girls boys there that try to start me should have been kicked out for Instigating the fight.

I asked for Security help and they did NOT do anything at all and they did not make me feel safe nor did they tell the girls to leave me alone or even give warning to them.

Please, make the management better and protect the customers for security reasons and for us to feel comfortable especially the fact that we are supporting the venue by buying Drinks, and just dancing having fun and trying to be friendly to everyone around with a smile. We pay drinks there $$$

Also this is not the first time that fights like this occurs here and I think management can be better to prevent such Gruesome future outcomes that can possibly even turn fatal.

Unfortunately I did not take pics of the girls there that try to fight me but i am sure know them plus everything is on Camera.

We came in Happy and in Peace from Morabito and Missfish and Unfortunately some of us left with such sadness and disappointment.

Hope other after hour Night Clubs in Bali can learn from this mistake also because it is getting out of control these ‚Äúrough girls/rough wannabe tough guys‚Äù situations üòí

Anyways, I am going to let it go now and move on nicely with my Life as always.

I will change the ‚≠êÔ∏è star to more than 1 star next time (if there is any); if the Management decide to train and give better salaries and Training to some of the Security and super Aggressive People should never be allowed in. It‚Äôs a danger ‚ö†Ô∏è to the customers there.

Ps: photos are of me and my old friends from a long time just before the fight happened with the territorial girls in there.",Even on a slow day they have the best DJ and entertainment. The music here is lit. I have tried many clubs in South East Asia but mann the dj here got taste. Kudos! Here for the music and the good crowd. Entrance fees would cost you around 150k-200k incl one drink. Definitely coming back again soon!,"Went there for latin night event. Nice venu, Dj ,  music, and the staff super friendly! üëç","We never knew this place existed all this time. Such a gem it is after 3 AM in the morning. If you‚Äôre looking for a place to Jam and party all night long , this is your prime place. It is open till 5:30-6 AM in the morning.
The crowd started gathering around 3 and got filled with people towards the end. The crowd was decent.
Small place though. But has a Dance floor and DJ. DJ‚Äôs pro and con were the same. Music and Beat.
They had a Red Room inside for 11 million IDR. ‚Äúkaroke‚Äù
Entry was 100k with 1 free drink.
Overall the vibe was 0 to 100 in no time.","Just about anywhere but the music was very good and the place very classy.

I book a one-bedroom villa but got upgraded to villa with two bedroom for free (with condition that the other room is locked tho). the air conditioner only exists on the bedroom. the living room only has fan so anticipate the hot weather.

specifically choose here for the bath tub that has jacuzzi, but need improvement on the cleanliness. also, actually there is a mistake on the design. The bath tub is tilted in the wrong direction, not the direction where the water drains, which makes it hard to drain the water when small amounts of water remains.

there is a kitchen but the gas is not available so we cannot cook

the location of my villa is too far from the lobby tho. the cleanliness can be improved. options of food stall/restaurant on a walk distance is not that many.

overall, need more improvement on some things, but enjoyed my stay here.","We stayed here for our honeymoon in March and loved it! Great location, amazing service.
