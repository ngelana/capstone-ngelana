ChIJ231Ey0cf0i0RLzAVZvwTvfc,Stanagiri Luxury Retreat Ubud,-8.3640334,115.3087665,"Jl. Br Jasan No.160, Sebatu, Kec. Tegallalang, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80561, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17851446472731865135,OPERATIONAL,,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.5,57,,"I stayed for 3d/2n. The villa is a true definitions of 'retreat', it's far from the tourist crowds of Ubud. Someone - or a group - who need a relax and laid back atmosphere will definitely enjoy staying in the villa.There is no aircon in the living room, but who needs it? When breeze air flows into the room.
The bedrooms are spacious and clean with complete amenities, needs to add body lotion though.
Recommended for family trip/group as the villa has 3 bedrooms, or a sunrise chaser, which only takes 20 minutes drive to the breathtaking sunrise view in Kintamani.
Once the construction of the restaurant has completed, it will be the best get-away 5 star villa.","I had an incredible time at Stanagiri, where I had the unique opportunity to swim at the swim-up lounge table with breathtaking paddy field views. The experience was truly exceptional, offering a serene atmosphere combined with the novelty of dining while in the pool. The view added a touch of nature's beauty to my dining experience, making it truly enjoyable.

The services provided by the butler were exceptional. The staff was attentive, accommodating, and consistently went the extra mile to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. Their attention to detail and willingness to cater to our needs greatly enhanced our stay.

The interior of Stanagiri exudes luxury, creating a truly indulgent environment. However, I noticed that there is room for improvement when it comes to water and electricity services. Ensuring a more reliable supply of both essentials would make the experience even more seamless. Nevertheless, despite these minor inconveniences, I would highly recommend Stanagiri for a luxurious and unique getaway with fantastic views and impeccable service.","i have literally no idea why the reviews of this place are high. villas not ready, no ac on ground floor, doors to access the pool dont close well, sofas were dusty and stained, walls had mold and some plaster falling off, main office not ready, restaurant not ready but the prices are too high. they also make ur expectations higher by posting youtube videos that make u feel ur gonna habe a luxurious experience which isnt the case. photos are also not the same as the real villas. though the staff is always goin an extra mile to serve you but in the end ur in the villa all the time and thats why it ruined all of it. everything was a mess and they should not at all charge the amount they are for these types of villas.","A perfect place to get away from the dirty crowded busy vibe in central ubud.
We stayed here in a two bedroom Villa, the staff had great communication skills, very helpful. Breakfast was delivered cold every morning but this is maybe because the kitchen / restaurant is far away and still being built, the workers in the next villas were not loud or a problem at all.
Two weeks in Bali and I stayed in over 6 hotels, this was by far our favorite. The view of the rice fields gives it an open feel, the tiles by the pool are dangerously slippery when wet, and no fencing so unsafe for small children.

Loved meeting the rice field workers which the hotel staff helped arrange and translate for us.

If we ever come to Bali again this will be the place we stay. Over seminyak, over ubud and over nusa dua.","I stayed in the grand villa. The resort staff warmly welcomed me and were extremely helpful in meeting my needs. Besides the beautiful paddy fields surrounding it, the hospitality was outstanding! I hope I can come back here next year, and I definitely want to experience the royal garden villa."
