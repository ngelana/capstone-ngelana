Really beautiful and amazing place. The staff was really nice and the security guy was amazing!
All that aside I wished the quality of the house was better for something this new. We stayed at Batukaru house and you couldn‚Äôt move the door to the kitchen, rest of the doors didn‚Äôt close, there were cracks in the walls, bathroom and shower felt a bit cheap, paint where it shouldn‚Äôt be paint and so on.. not what you expected when paying this much per night. There is also a lot of wild dogs living outside that barked all night long for a week and loud neighbors.","Private villa, private pool great view to rice farm. Stunning place, amazing people, great service. Super nice place to chill, enjoy","very unique place to stay, nice and clean. with nice rice field view and have private pool also enjoy sunset... i recommend the place.. the staff is very friendly and responsive",Such a great studio / tiny house living. Great inside outside spaces with a magnificent views onto the rice fields in front. Very quiet area. It's what I think of when I have a Bali vacation in mind,One of the best designs i‚Äôve experienced

P.S. If you look at the rating and wonder why it‚Äôs 4.6 stars, it‚Äôs because all the 1-star reviews are from local Grab and Gojek drivers. Their experience with this restaurant is close to zero. Their reviews stem from having to wait for food for more than 5 minutes.

We had tacos , kebab and green mango salad",First time here at the recommendation of a friend and I love it! Tasty dishes with flavourful ingredients (I had the Bali fish curry). Service is excellent and responsive and it‚Äôs good value for money. I will be back,"Great food great prices. Best Mie Goreng I have tried in the islands. It just feels like your mom is cooking for you once again. It‚Äôs a very welcoming place. They genuinely care about making good food. Their dish sizes are quite bigger than I expected. You can perfectly eat with one dish, not like in many other Warungs.",1000/10 recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a delicious meal!
