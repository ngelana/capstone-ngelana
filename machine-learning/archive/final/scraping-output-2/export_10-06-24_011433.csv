The first time I came here was 2022. Sate was full of flavour.

I ordered 10 Babi + 5 Ayam + 1 Kuah Balung.","I tried the babi sate here, it was good but I‚Äôve had much better from other places. The marinaded sauce was a little on the sweet side and the pork didn‚Äôt have much grill char taste. It might be because their sate are cooked on a grill machine and not live charcoal. The sambal it‚Äôs served with was mild, I was hoping for a more spicy flavor. Service was very friendly, but it‚Äôs a small shack on side of the road so not super clean. Price is very cheap, comes out to 5K for 3 skewers, regardless of how many you buy.",Super delicious! Shared a dozen sate ayam and a dozen sate babi among 3 people. Added 2 serves of tipat. Yum! Owner was friendly and even allowed us to order the grilled fish from next stall.,"Very nice flavour, slightly spicy. One portion of sate babi for IDR 15K, very good value for money. Plus a very friendly and cheerful owner. This is a small stall off the main road.","We were recommended this small, family owned and run restaurant by a new friend who works in the hotel we stayed at. We're so grateful! We were warmly greeted and enjoyed the food, conversation and hospitality so much. Best Sate in Bali! Mild, but add as much chilli as you like. You know you're on a winner when there's no tourists, but plenty of locals who rate this place. Thank you Dewar and family!"

He was an incredibly knowledgeable guide and we felt like we got a true Balinese experience during all the sightseeing. He‚Äôs also a great cook and every breakfast we had there was so flavorful. Will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Bali!,"Wayan - where do I start!!! The entire 8 days with you at Dim House was made so comfortable with your lovely hospitality and smile. It takes a lot of passion to be like you to ensure we were comfortable through out, taken care, helping us plan the itinerary, take us around and be absolutely flexible to help us have a memorable vacation.

The entire experience was absolutely in your words ""wowing"".

A big thank you to You and Ayu for having us at the Dim House.

The breakfast, by far has been the bestest breakfast we enjoyed thoroughly every single day. Such authentic flavors and variety of local dishes. Amazing flavours, so customised to also help my daughter.

The toilets and entire property is so clean. Has a fridge, microwave and fully loaded kitchen to even cook if needed.

Has a master bedroom with attached toilet and another single bed room + a common toilet.

I would anyday recommend Wayan and Dim House for a memorable Bali Trip.

I am coming back soon Wayan. See you next time on a Royal Enfield. ‚ò∫Ô∏è","Dear Wayan

You have been the best host and tour guide we could have wished for!
With your open and friendly behaviour and as well with your fantastic knowledge about Bali and the wonderful places you showed us, it was an unforgettable week for us.
We were able to see many beautiful places and were able to collect fantastic moments - thanks to you.

We also would like to thank your family who made the dimhouse to our home. They took really good care of us, especially the local delicious breakfast was our highlight each day.

Thank you for everything! We always will recommend you.

Best regards
Lina, Svenja & Verena","Best tour guide I had no doubt about it, could not have asked for more and the best places were suggested by Wayan. And also we had the best chauffeur with us to take us everywhere, thank you for your hospitality and your kindness, I will sure be back and live at your place","If you're looking for a place that's relaxing and not in a busy noisy touristy area this is ideal.

The place is very clean, modern and well equipped and Wayan and his family are perfect hosts. They also provide great breakfasts and are always willing to help. Another advantage is that they are very easy to communicate with.

I will certainly stay again when I visit Bali , it's great value for money and so long as you rent a scooter ( which is the perfect and cheapest way to get around ) you can get to most areas very easily.

Don't miss out by booking late."
