This time brought my (80 year old) parents from U.K.

Amazing views! Breakfast is excellent.

Staff are very good indeed - we felt well looked after and they were keen to help with arranging a later checkout.

Had an issue with funicular (hotel has a lot of stairs) but these things happen. Be careful in the wet as I slipped on one set of stairs due to green algae.

Lovely gardens and the pool is a good size. A very relaxing place indeed!

Very happy and will definitely go back.

Oh and a table tennis set up in a large room! Great fun.","We are returning guests, love it here and just arrived again.

What happened to the wonderful welcome treat at the pool? ( strawberry sorbet ice and drink )😢

To be honest a little disappointed the experience is gone.

For the rest everything is amazing! A towel rack in the room would great addition to dry them and wet swim gear properly.","Great hotel to stay in Baturiti Area.
The room is great. Clean and the amenities are good too.
Facilities are great. There's a swimming pool, fitness center, pingpong table, spa, and mini soccer field.
The pool and the mini soccer field have a nice view.

The hotel location is near to Bedugul lake or Ulan Danu temple. About 20 minutes driving.
Foods, 24 hours mini market, cafe located Near the hotel too.",Beautiful gardens surrounding the hotel and pool. Really kind and helpful staff. Nothing was too much trouble.

P.S I booked the massage and it was amazing. After long rides on a motorbike in the rain and a backpack - it has really sorted me out!","All the employees and the owner as well were super kind and helpful. The room was clean and cozy. Food was ok but you need to wait a bit longer for it. The accomodation has beautiful location with a breathtaking view, highly recommended!","We stayed here for a 3 nights and fell in love with the place. Apart from the lovely view of rice terraces, they have quite good facilities and very helpful staffs. The room is decent and clean. It has no AC but it gets cold in the afternoon to night time. It’s near to the tourist attractions and good restaurants too! Great value for money!","We stopped here for the night while travelling through Bali. This place is a peaceful gem about 150m right off the road. The views are beautiful and the rooms were perfect, the bed was so comfortable. The owner Nyoman was an amazing host and the staff were so lovely and friendly. Breakfast was good and decent variety. Will Definitely go back. We loved it.",Beautiful and picturesque place.

hot shower works continuously but need to wait abit to heat up, view from the restaurant is excellent, the service was very very nice.

attm the place was still feels unprepared and unmanage, mainly the room, the price was abit overprice i think, the place definitely sold heavily on the view from the restaurant (not room)","food was OK, but just OK. I'll correct my rating if I get sick. and yes, up the street (lawar Bali Packung) is a great warung where you only pay 1/4 of the price","Beware Tourist trap! Drivers bring you here, as they get free food. But this was the most expensive all-you-can eat buffet in Bali!

It has beautiful views all around of the nature, mountains and greeneries. They have a nicely maintained garden also. The whole restaurant is peaceful and built with wood- gives a special vibe. Pricing is slightly upwards. We had fish and chips and prawns fry. They came with tasty sauces, salads and fries. Delicious but the amount could be improved upon. Then I had an orange juice. One of the very best in taste. Overall I am happy.","Great place to eat.
We stopped for lunch and the food, the service , the view, the vibe was great. :)
We tried different dishes and all of them were great. I recommend the spring roles - are a bit oily but very tasty.
And of course the pancakes were delicious.
Another good option is Mie goreng - fried nuddels.","Passed this place quite often, and decided to give it a try today.

It was quite cozy, lovely view, with green gardens and rustic Indonesian feel.

The staff were very friendly and welcoming.

The food were good, served hot and freshly cooked with reasonable price.

We were so hungry did not take any photos of the food 😅","the first time eating here, the price is very expensive with an ordinary taste. for 40 thousand rupiah you can only get 5 calamari ring, I know it's big but it's still expensive.

very quiet and cool, but we can’t see the full view because it is blocked by the plants in front of the table that they planted.","Food is decent, nothing surprising or impressive but simple good food. Price is also fair for the food quality. All dishes we tried (multiple fish and rice dishes) were good.

It's a buffet, but choice of food is really poor. Costs 150k (+tax 20%), large beer 45k (+tax 20%). If you can choose, take another place - but most likely you will be dropped in front of the place and asked to go in for lunch. It's not the worst place, but average Bali is better than this","The food was so Bad. Worst meal i hv ever had in Bali. So expensive and overpriced.
The food was cold, terrible and with insects. 150k per person , the waitress told us secretly in the table , i think different people with different price.

DON’T GO !! DON’T GO!! and DON’T GO!!

The driver took us there and i think he must can get some profit from that. You can say no and go to another, otherwise you will regret.","Worst food in Bali!
We had a private driver and told him we’re hungry! I guess a lot of tourists walk into this tourist trap!
Buffet is horrible! Food stinks tastes no good and some of the dishes you don’t even know what you are eating!

View on the rice fields is not bad!

If you realize your driver wants to take you there give him a little tip and let him drive you somewhere else!

Additional info: No toilet seats to sit on....","Like many people before we had a bad experience at lunch. We were driven to the restaurant by the tour driver and would have denied if we had known how bad it was. Food is served as a buffet and the quality is really poor. Price is relatively high (120,000 rupiahs plus service tax) for Indonesian standards. Rather go to a good warung where you get better food for less money. The only positive thing about the place is the fantastic view at the rice terraces."

Was thinking to go to one of the hotel at Pacung already when I saw this beautiful hotel, Golden Tulip. Buffet Breakfast cost 150k nett per person which is a very good value for what they offered. Giant long tables were packed of great dishes from East to West, hot and cold. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. The view is breathtaking. Will try to stay there next time.","An above average restaurant with a GORGEOUS view. Makes for a great stopover for lunch or an afternoon drink/tea on the way to Bedugul.

Nestled inside the Royal Tulip Resorts, there are plenty of parking spaces.

Food was ok. Probably didn’t order enough to really comment on its overall quality. Had a salad and an Indonesia dish with fish and rice.

Drinks were ok. Had the Beauty La Femme, which sounded promising but tasted more like cough syrup. Wouldn’t order that again but will definitely be back to try other items from the menus.",Experienced an Indonesian buffet. The food is delicious and the ambiance is also breathtaking.

If you are in Bali, come here!!","This place is well worth a little detour from the main road to Bedugul! A stunning view, a very friendly atmosphere, and a cosy setting. Even the short walk with a couple of stairs from the roadside entrance to the warung itself is a nice experience. The food is good and carefully plated---some other reviewers found it a bit too pricey, but I don't think it's fair to compare prices at this place to a roadside warung where you sit on plastic chairs with the traffic passing by right next to your plate. I recommend this place for individuals and small groups. I arrived on my roadbike, and they let me park the bike just outside the dining area.",Beautiful little gem with amazing views over the ricefields! True Balinese experience.
