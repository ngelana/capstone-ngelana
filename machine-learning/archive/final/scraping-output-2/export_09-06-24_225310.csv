ChIJGVOTLmKG0S0RRhvWYL-IZqc,Lesong Hotel and Restaurant,-8.272427,115.04918800000002,"Gesing, Banjar, Buleleng Regency, Bali 81161, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=12062479007503227718,OPERATIONAL,+62 859-6594-4522,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.4,197,,"An amazing experience! Excellent location, facilities and staff. The service goes far and beyond expectations. Infinity pool with great view. Rice terraces either side of all rooms. Restaurant also has beautiful 180¬∞ views. Staff were so friendly and even specially served my wife fresh durian. You must do the local walk around the area. Memorable and peaceful!","If you want quiet, to enjoy the nature of Bali and relax, definitely this is the place.

The personnel was amicable and helpful, and the tour to the forest, canoe on the lake and the waterfall was stunning. Willy, the guide, was incredible, had excellent knowledge of the fauna and flora and was very happy to reply to any question of Balinese culture.

I cannot recommend it more :) I wish I had stayed a bit longer. I'll recommend staying in Munduk for me at least three nights!

Thank you, Lesong Team!","I am absolutely gobsmacked that I have picked Lesong as my family's vacation stay. We wake up each morning with breath-taking views at our balcony. It is tranquil and picture perfect. We have the rice fields and mountains in front of us. The pool is refreshing after a day out. The family room is super spacious and the bathroom is huge, with a nice water pressure.

For breakfast, there is free flow of bread, spread, coffee and tea. We also get to order  two items each from the Western and Indonesian menu.

The staff are very friendly, attentive and helpful. They offer free advice on the local activities we can do around the hotel. Our room is cleaned daily with new bottles of water given. There is a kettle and free tea and coffee bags. No t.v. and fridge but that do bother us in the slightest. However, there is free wifi.

Being surrounded by nature, we can hear frogs, roosters and crickets. There are free ear buds in the room if you are sensitive to noise.

Overall, Lesong is a beautiful hotel with lots to offer. We highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Munduk.","Tucked away, behind a ""main"" (local) road, is the Lesong Hotel. Gorgeous gardens and impeccable rooms (workmanship and cleanliness) with stunning views of the property's rice terraces. The staff are wonderful and the food is good too! We did not want to leave!! There is lots to see and do nearby, waterfalls (20k per adult) and rice terraces, and the most stunning mountain views.",Really nice place! We actually came from Kuta and it felt like a different world (amazing peace and quiet)! It's the perfect size for a hotel. Big enough to provide good infrastructure and not so big that you feel like just the next number on a list.
