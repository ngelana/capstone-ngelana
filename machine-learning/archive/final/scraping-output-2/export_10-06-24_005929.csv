Atmosphere is so quiet, peaceful and laid back. Great for journaling, reading or working.

I ordered big brekky and coconut water. Delicious.",Great fresh juice options. Coffee was not good however. Food is average. Pet friendly. Lots of good looking and colorful birds to see.,"Simply a lovely place that you must visit. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is great with relaxing music and a nice view over the tree tops. Maybe most importantly, the food was excellent! Absolutely recommend!","A really calm place, I feel like it was so peaceful and almost too quiet even though I wasn‚Äôt the only one there. They serve healthy foods & beverages which are perfect for breakfast/brunch if you‚Äôre staying around pererenan-tabanan area.","Beautiful little Cafe, just off the main road to Tanah Lot. Open from 8am to 3:30. Great selection for breakfast and lunch with vegan and vegetarian options. I chose their Vegan Sandwich sourdough/saut√©ed spinach/mushroom/cucumber/fresh tomatoes/Japanese sesame ponzu/small salad. (Not because I am vegan, but because I always chose something with cucumber if I can, as he is the cook in the family and he hates cucumber). They also made me a good coffee.

Bonus is that it is a cool and relaxing spot, looking over tree tops, Easy parking and relaxing soft music so lovely spot to meet a friend for chat over breakfast and lunch."

Meet the owner Pak Dewa. He is very welcome and a nice person. The accommodation is provided in a separate kitchen. You can cook by yourself. It has a huge garden too, which is where you can make a birthday event I think. The room also overlooked the river and garden. If you rent for a long term also available in a good price. They also had a swimming pool with a river view. The situation was cool and quiet. I think it is good for yoga too.","We visited for a few hours today while staying in my husband's village.

It‚Äôs the best dog club we have found in the area, and I might even say in Bali ‚ù§Ô∏è we are totally in love with Charity. The owner, Kurnia is amazing and her staff is also very kind.","This is by far my favourite dog club in Bali! My little Bali dog enjoys her time here so much as they truly take care of each and every dog. I never feel bad about leaving her there for boarding or daycare as the owner and staff are the sweetest, most caring people. They also gave my dog a wash and arranged a little birthday surprise to her. Couldn't recommend enough! It's like a kindergarten for my dog, she loves it!","I‚Äôve been bringing my dog Matilda here 5-6 days a week since she was a puppy. She has so much energy and needs lots of exercise.

The owner and staff are exceptional: always going out of their way to care for her. She gets nutritious meals, treats, lots of love, play time, and even an occasional bath.

They sometimes even offer me a beverage or fresh fruit from the garden. I feel greatly cared for, too! üôè

Matilda loves charity so much - she gets excited when it‚Äôs time to ‚Äúgo to school‚Äù (as I joke with my local neighbors).

I‚Äôve left her for a few overnight stays as well. It is such a relief when I‚Äôm traveling to know she is happy, safe, and well cared for.

I wish I could adopt more dogs (there are some super cute and sweet ones if you‚Äôre looking to foster or adopt).

Would definitely recommend you visit to just play with the dogs or consider this local business over the more commercial (and expensive!) competitors. The sunsets are also glorious. :)","Excellent open space for dog care and rescues. Incredibly clean and very caring and attentive staff.

The owner, Kurnia, is incredibly lovely and passionate about caring for animals.

I came to visit the dogs and support the charity, I would 100% leave my dog here if I had one üòÅ

Well done to all the staff for doing such a wonderful job for the precious pooches üêï ‚ù§Ô∏è üëè"

As a result, several motorcycles, including mine, had small specks of paint. When asked to wash the motorcycles, he replied that he was not responsible for this.

Quite and far from the party place in Bali. Close to Tanah Lot and Cemagi Beach. The place is very private. Our room was really nice and clean. The services from Sulan and Dewi are superb. We cant thank them enough because they took care of us from breakfast, renting motorbike and tips and directions.","Everything was just perfect for us! This is a hidden gem in the middle of nature, but also not far from the Canggu area and Tanah Lot. Since the place is in the jungle and next to a river, don't be surprise to see bats, birds, geckos or other incredible creatures. This is not uncommon in Indonesia, anyway. Renting a scooter is recommended, since The Luku Villa is located next to a traditional  village, so you will experience the Balinese local life, but you'll not find a lot of restaurants, bars or grocery stores at walking distance. Another good thing to know is that the villa's are situated down a hill, so this might not be the best choice if you have mobility problems. That being said, this is an amazing place to stay! The house itself was spacious, clean and well designed. It offered the right amount of luxury to us: we loved the private pool and the fact that the villa's were located in a way that you have your privacy. We felt like royals when the delicious breakfast was delivered daily to our villa. Ibu Dewi & the rest of the staff were just amazing and made sure that we had an incredible 2 week stay at The Luku!","So many cockroach..... very dusty,
