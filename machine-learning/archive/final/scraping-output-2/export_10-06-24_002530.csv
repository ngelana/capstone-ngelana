ChIJAYD-diUY0i0R-wLbpEFX2zI,Bon Nyuh Bungalows,-8.4736879,115.3190199,"Desa Petak Kelod, Petak, Gianyar, Gianyar Regency, Bali 80511, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=3664618661246337787,OPERATIONAL,+62 811-399-238,lodging,lodging,4.5,39,,"Out of the 6 hotels and guest houses we stayed at in Bali, Bon Nyuh was the most expensive. Yet it lacks in some basic provisions - no toiletries or even hand soap, no tea or coffee in the room, no fruit at breakfast. The location is relaxing and peaceful, but very rural so a bit far from shops and restaurants. We ate dinner at the bungalows twice, and while the food was nice enough, the portions were small and it didn't feel like it was worth the money (3 times what we paid at a local Warung). The staff were nice and accommodating, but the level of cleanliness could have been improved. The room was large and comfortable, and they provided drinking water. It was still a lovely experience but considering what you can get in Bali for much less, the price did not reflect what we received.",We've stayed here many times. It's always so peaceful. Friendly staff great food and tranquil surrounds. I went for a walk though the paddy fields this morning and came across a group of locals threshing rice using traditional methods to harvest the rice. It was quite fascinating to watch the process.,"Well maintained bungalows.. private. Decent to stay away from city traffic, city noise. Paddy fields around is great experience. Though food options are limited, we enjoyed immensely.","Went here with my family. My brother and I loved it, this place is cozy and their food is GREAT plus it has a swimming pool this place is too amazing I can't- I miss this place already and the staff and very friendly too I recommend you to stay here for at least 1 night and you will already love this place",Amazing place. Huge room with serene view and nice staff! Good choice for retreat from the hustle :)
