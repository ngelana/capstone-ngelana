The taste was authentic and can only be found at some parts of Bali only.",Good food in Singaraja! Siobak Babi Khe Lok is a delicious dish that is worth trying if you have the opportunity to do so in Singaraja. Make sure to come and visit! Cheap and very very good!,"Part of the northern Bali culinary that you should not miss. The og outlet has been in operation since 1960s. The siobak (sao rou, roast pork) which was originally a Chinese cuisine was introduced by immigrants and then assimilated and transformed into their own version. The dark sauce used is rather spicy and various cuts (innards, lean meat, belly)  are up for you to choose. Fried skin was also provided as part of the meal. I tried the mixed one as it provides layers of textures and flavors but found it very ordinary. Service was fast and the price was fair.","The infamous siobak babi in Singaraja. So packed with people, mostly Chinese Indo-a great indicator of a tasty food- and I was not wrong. It's overall tasty. Too bad I'm not into the sauce they used here.

The fruit juices are not recommendable tho. They are cheap as well but way too watery, I could've skipped on those. Unfortunately they don't serve dessert.

We ordered veg burger, french fries, veg. Pizza & ice tea. Taste was okay, doable, but quantity of fries & pizza was less compared to rate.
