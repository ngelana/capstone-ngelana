I wouldn't recommend this place for anybody with mobility issues, as it is a very steep path down, and to get back up is very tiring.
It is a very hidden place and is accessible by car or by scooter with a cheap parking spot nearby.
On the whole, I do recommend this place for a visit, as it was well worth the steep climb, but I would recommend you take a tour guide as it is very hard to find.","Great waterfall with picturesque views and multiple spots to stop for photos. Short, steep walk via stairs to get down to the waterfall. Free parking just up the road from the entrance. 20K IDR entry fee.","Pretty cool waterfall, nice lil walk down and a sweaty one back up. Entry is 20k I think, if you continue down the path and head to the right there is also another waterfall which is much better for swimming in.","I have been taking my clients for over 30 years to visit this beautiful waterfall. It‚Äôs known by local as Tanah Barak Waterfall.

From the parking lots, we have to take the walk down to the waterfall through the local clove and coffee plantation which is truly a lovely walk.

An entrance ticket for this waterfall is IDR 20,000 per person which you have to pay at the bottom close to the waterfall. A guy is always there to give you a print out ticket.

It‚Äôs really worth to be visited if you are touring over to Munduk Village.","Wonderful walk down to the waterfall. Exhausting but worth it on the way up. It'll be slippery so wear your best shoes. Bring water for the ascent, it's a very steep walk up!"

The service was incredible with so much attention to detail. The food in the restaurant was some of the best I‚Äôve ever eaten - so delicious. The stay was also just fantastic value for money. Thank you so much to the team for making us so welcome.,"I‚Äôm so grateful to the staff for their incredible hospitality. They really went above and beyond for us. We did the water purification ceremony and visited the nearby Buddhist temple. Both were very special experiences. We could hear a waterfall from our room and two more awesome falls were in walking distance. Also, from the dining room there was one of the most spectacular sunsets we have ever seen! Thank you Giday and the rest of the staff üôè","overwhelmed with the good hospitality!! Everyone here was very welcoming, food is good, breakfast was very fulfilling, clean rooms with great view‚Ä¶
Highly recommended.

Best part - provided hot water bags and hot chocolate when we got drenched in the rain!!",We had an amazing time here. The staff is so kind and wants to do everything for you. The view and place of the hotel are beautiful. The hotelroom we were staying in was very nice but the curtains are see through. Overall we would highly recommend this hotel if you enjoy nature.,"A stay in a very lush and mesmerizing environment. Nature and comfort are uniquely and organically merged. The service is nothing short of exceptional, the staff very professional and incredibly hospitable."

There's a cafe where you can sit and enjoy the nature..and they have rooms for rent too.,"Amazing experience.
Here you can hike for hours, get lost on side paths, all the while walking through expansive hydrangea field (this whole area is dedicated to growing them)
Very different from nearby Banyumala (twin waterfalls) and Banyu Wana Amertha, where you pay exorbitant prices for a boring and tourist-packed 20-40 min experience (walk down, take pictures, walk back up),","Amazing waterfall, only 3minutes down from the main street. The accommodation provided the paveway to waterfall below.","BEWARE!! Locals told me this is a new trail crafted so the local resort can charge tourists for entry. It‚Äôs dangerous and unreliable. Use the original trail.

Many people are getting lost!!

Tourist trap.",like spot and beatiful place..

The track to the waterfall is 5 minutes down the stairs, it starts at a warung with friendly locals, where you can buy some local spices as well. The road is well maintained, very clean, and offering a real jungle experience with the sound of birds, insects, and flowing water. The waterfall is very high, and there‚Äôs a natural pool where you can swim in the fresh water, there are floaties provided. The place was only for us when we went, and it was on Sunday, something very rare in most of the touristy places in Bali. Entrance fee of 20k is totally worth it! If you enjoy tracking, you can continue walking for around 45-60 minutes, and you‚Äôll reach another waterfall. Maybe next time we‚Äôll do it :)","20,000 entery fee which seemed very fair. The waterfall was well looked after and had rubber tubes next to it so you could float and relax in the water. There was also a big jungle hiking path next to the waterfall that was really good, we didn't make it to the end but what we did do was fun.","Beautiful! Only like 3-5 minutes walk from the main street, and you'll see the waterfall and a semi private natural pool! Super cold for meü•∂ They provide tyres as floating too!

If you continue walk to the south, you'll end up at mini waterfall with private natural pool! And if yoh continue north, you can get to the water source.

There's also accommodation and restaurant upstairs!","Amazing place!! So clean and well maintained..we were there alone, entry for 20k","For 20000 one of the cheapest waterfalls
Unfurtnally not a long hike
But nice quiet place for having a chill out
You can swim in the waterfall"

Beautiful view, good prices!‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è","Came here to watch the sunset from the comfort of their beanbags and ended up having probably the best meal out of our 2 weeks in Bali! The staff were so so lovely and explained the menu to us. We ordered the calamari curry and the vegetable curry and they tasted amazing, we talk about it most daysüòÇ I would highly recommend coming here if you‚Äôre staying in Munduk.","Highly recommend coming to this lovely restaurant for a meal. The ingredients are mostly local and organic, and the food prepared was delicious. We had their penne pesto with grilled chicken, chicken rendang with mashed sweet potatoes, pumpkin soup and bread with hummus - and it was all well prepared, fresh, and tasty. And we started with an appetizer of edamame beans which was the fresher we have ever had (as it was locally grown). Excellent and thoughtful service from their waitstaff, they brought us warm pouches to hold when we felt cold as the climate here can get chilly in the evenings being in higher elevations. I will definitely return again if we visit Munduk.","Excellent food, great place to stay, amazing host! ü•∞"
