ChIJZ7s1gUIj0i0RpJe0WNaJmLw,Pengempu Waterfall,-8.469335,115.20346649999999,"G6J3+798, Jl. Seribupati, Cau Belayu, Kec. Marga, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82181, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=13589763429294708644,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.2,650,,"A bit disappointing because the trail was cut off by a fallen tree; even after climbing over the fallen tree, I could not get close to the falls unless I waded across the river. I was wearing long pants and shoes for scooter riding so I didn't bother. The downstream area looked nice.

The toilets were open but those steps back up are difficult on a really hot day.","If you're chasing waterfalls in Bali, Pengempu is another one to add to the list. Slightly less volume of water than other locations, but slightly fewer tourists also... and the surrounding forest and downstream river is beautiful, tranquil, clean and clear. Yes, you still have to put in the steps down (and back up) to get there! Parking is very limited. Since a flood affected the river trail, accesssing the pool itself is a little trickier in the last few meters, but there is a trail split to the south which will take you down to a scramble over a fallen log, then along the river to a beautiful spot to sit with the dragonflys and enjoy the peaceful waters streaming by.

Don't count on the newly-installed washroom facilities... They were both locked when I was most recently there.","Nice waterfall. Parking outside entrance. No charge. Toilets there, maybe no paper. About a 5 min walk down concrete steps, with handrail. Then left down dirt path to steps leading to water. Water still flowing, looks ok. Probably nice spot to swim below falls. I imagine it looks impressive in rainy season.",Lovely waterfall but as we went at the end of the dry season there was not a lot of water.  Fairly steep walk down.,"This was close by on our way past, found it on google. Was free and also a short walk down to. Sadly the toilets were locked. And so much filthy rubbish everywhere. Was near a tip as well. This place needs attention and a clean up to be a proper tourist attraction. Otherwise could be a lovely waterfall place. We still enjoyed it as an activity and saw a monkey in the rubbish. Too dirty a place to swim."

Very recommended. Delicious pork meatballs serve with Bakso Balung (pork broth), and also they have Bakso Beranak (big meatballs with quails egg and small meatballs inside)ðŸ¥°  They open from 8am-9pm. The staff are friendly and helpful. If you would like to charge your phone, there is also can do it free.","We asked our driver to take us to the most authentic (but clean) place he knew - we were not disappointed. This place is known among locals for dates for young couples and good food. We highly recommend coming here and joining the locals for the amazing soup.

(We had chicken and added soy sauce and chili which was amazing. We're trying poro next time!)","We are European and for us it was super tasty ðŸ˜‹

It's local place with super cheap prices and tasty food (and tea)

Highly recommend ðŸ‘Œ","Great place for lunch or dinner, the service is wonderful. The place is clean, but quite small. No free wifi, but not a big problem. Bakso Beranak is the best choice, you'll be remember the taste of it.","My BF loved it.
It was very cheap.
We spent only R21000 for a soup, one sprite and one fruit."
