It shows a bold acculturation between Balinese and Chinese culture.","Wonderful temple, active with regular sessions and talks, in lovely part of Bali next to flowing river. Well set out facilities for those visiting.","Nice small Chinese Buddhist temple with colorful offering and peaceful vibe. Located under the bridge. The buddhist monk has cermons, but in bahasa indones so don‚Äôt hope to understand..","Amurva Bhumi Temple is the name of the vihara which was inaugurated on March 2, 1988. The vihara, which was previously rehabilitated in 1950, has a site that extends from south to north. Inside the monastery there are Kong Tjo buildings and other supporting buildings","Unfortunately this beautiful Vihara is not well maintained. This place is kind of abandoned. It would be nice if someone stays there at the entrance, hence when tourists come, he/she could explain this beautiful Vihara. The school is also empty."

A waterfall down one track, and a temple with swimming area down another. Entrance by donation. Nice & quiet.","This is a really cool place to relax, seems like a local spot for showering as a saw a few people naked (be prepared).  I only walked down to the temple overlooking the river so I will be going back to swim and find the waterfall.    For those looking for monkeys you will definitely see them here if your patient.  We saw at least 3 separate gangs running/swinging around.  Be careful the steps are very slippery.","Lovely secluded place not known to many tourists and even locals - our driver did not even know it, and we were alone in the park area!
You can climb down some stairs to come close to the river, and it is so peaceful and meditative there! And we saw a large group of wild monkeys taking a drink from the river!! It was absolutely awesome to see them out in the nature, a very different experience from the very controlled Ubud Monkey forest!
It is free, but there is a donation bin for money to buy food for the monkeys.",Amazing experience to be able to see monkeys in the middle of the forest and jumping above the river. You can swim in the river of take a shower under the stream. The place work on donation.,"Super nice scenery and beautiful river, free entry and donation based but couldn‚Äôt find any monkeys üôà:("

This review hopefully remains relevant when I post it.

I received a recommendation from a college friend who said that Depot Qiu Qiu is a place that provides delicious Chinese food with a relatively affordable price. When I heard this, and I was craving Chinese food, I made my way there after around 30-minutes journey.

Here, I ordered the fried rice, and I found that the taste and price were proportional. The Chinese food is simple, but quite tasty. The atmosphere is suitable for dining with family as most tables and chairs are for 4 or more people.

Overall, I would come back here again if I want to eat Chinese food. Aside from the affordable prices, the menu offered is also quite varied.","Just across vihara, good food, best price","Great food
Great price
Authentic Chinese taste, with the proper sauces and herbs.","Real Chinese food and affordable price!
All food is yummy",Yummy... Wuenaaakkkkkkk!!!
