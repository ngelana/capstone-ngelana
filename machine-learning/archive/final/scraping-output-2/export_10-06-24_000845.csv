I've seen many black sand beaches in my life but I must say this was the best one so far!

I arrived there around 1pm (March, 2024) and there was absolutely nobody except me. I went down the bamboo ladder which is in a good condition now and when I was already down, I realized there's another way to get there, by stairs ðŸ™‚ The bamboo ladder made it more adventurous tho ðŸ˜œ

It's beautiful, clean, empty and peaceful. I've been to Amed hundreds of times and I've never seen this beach before so it was a great surprise. It takes around 30min drive to get there from the center of Amed.","Be very careful about the waves because they are strong and can easily suck you into the sea with rocks on each side. Could be fatal.

However it's beautiful to see and you will probably be alone there. Use stairs as ladder is broken and cannot be trusted imo. Don't expect any shops, toilet or anything.

One of the best looking beaches I've been to even if not for swimming (unless you are brave/crazy to do it).","A gem. Beautiful black coarse sand beach and a safe place for the fishing boats to park. My first time today, and apart from one friendly man retouching his boat, there was nobody, sheer bliss. As it is a bay, the current and the waves were very strong. Go in the water where the boats are lying, itâ€™s the less unpredictable part. Donâ€™t wear your stilettos as youâ€™ll have to go down (and back up) a bamboo ladder.",Beautiful beach but DO NOT swim here. There are crazy riptides at the beach that can easily drown someone. The ocean floor also drops off very deep very quickly. I would recommend just to enjoy the uniqueness of this beach. Ladder was a little sketchy but we went down without an issue.,A cool place to visit. It is steep to get to the beach with a ladder at the last part

So far this is my favourite place on Bali. No tourism, no traffic. Just the sound of the ocean & silence. 180 degree ocean view in front and wonderful mountains in the back. I stayed two nights but would have loved to stay more. Made and his family take very good care of the place, everything is clean and nice, the food is delicious and they even made a fire at night for me. I enjoyed it so much. The place has an access to a beach where i could just walk alone. The sunrises are stunning! Normally I wake up late but I wouldnâ€™t want to miss out on this.
Recommend to people who want to escape noisy digital daily life. And if you still want to explore places, they are like 30 Min. easy driving, the road is very good and fun to drive because so much beauty and authentic balinese life around. Itâ€™s the best place and I would love to come back.","i have found my happy place! what a gem! this was one of the most wonderful, secluded, quiet, beautiful perfect holidays i have had in a while. made, nomang and zusana were the most gracious and accommodating hosts. the food was delicious and good servings. i was mesmerized watching the moon and sun rises from the private black sand beach and / or villa. the worst thing about this place was leaving. definitely book your stay if you're looking for a quiet and gorgeous escape!",One of the most peaceful and lovely place I have experienced. Plus very kind community surrounded by and beautiful nature around. Sure we will come back! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!,mamtap,
