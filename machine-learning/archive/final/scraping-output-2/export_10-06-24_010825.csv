It‚Äôs nice to try something new as i never had Lomie before, it has that fishy taste which is inique.

A bit disappointed when seeing the bill.
Just another noodles on the more expensive side considering the amount of meat served.
The only thing that‚Äôs special is the noodle type, the thick one (I looovvee udon-like noodle) but this one is not chewy like udon. Sooo‚Ä¶ yeah just average

I would not come back for the food
Service is attentive
Place is clean I like the heavy plate and bowl with texture just seem fancy for some reason","Location is strategic.
There's an air conditioning inside, food is cooked in Chinese style.

It takes around 20 minutes to be served (normal)","One of the best pork noodles I've ever had in Bali. Expect generous amount of topping (ground pork, meat, bacon, and pork belly). You can choose your own type of noodles: the string noodles, wide noodles (kinda like fettucine), and big noodles. I tried the big noodles and the texture is perfect, not too soggy."
