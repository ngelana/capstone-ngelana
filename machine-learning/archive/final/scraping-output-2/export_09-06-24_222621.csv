I had such a lovely time. Buda and his family gave us a warm welcome and took care of me during the stay. The nature is amazing! The place is very calm and peaceful, exactly what I needed after some stressful months back home. I was happy with the very clean room, the hammock and the beautiful view. I could just sit there the whole day and look at the rice fields :) The food was delicious, Buda prepares healthy meals and amazing coffees. Dont miss the chance to spend some wonderdful days to experience an authetic balinese lifestyle. Thanks Buda for the great time! See you again next timeü§ôüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è.",If you have the opportunity to do a tour with Buda don‚Äôt miss out. He is the sweetest soul in Bali. We had the most wonderful experience and not only recommend it highly but will definitely come back. üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº,"Year of end means time for reflection and memorizing all the great moments during the past months. One of my highlights was for sure my 4 night stay at Budas homestay in april. I had such a lovely time. Buda and his family gave me a warm welcome and took care of me during the stay. I had a bicycle accident in Ubud the day before and were a bit scared due to some injuries and side effects and being on my own. Budas nephew accompanied me to the hospital and made sure I was fine. Buda arranged a waterful tour the day after that fit my limitations (not too exhausting). The nature is amazing! I also did the cultural village tour with Buda, an inspiring experience. I learnt a lot about the culture, religion and local life. The place is very calm and peaceful, exactly what I needed after some stressful months back home. Yes, it is basic and there is no warm water. But I did not miss it at all. I was happy with the very clean room, the hammock and the beautiful view. I could just sit there the whole day and look at the rice fields :) The food was delicious, Budas wife prepares healthy meals and amazing juices. The whole family is gorgeous and Angel, one of the daughters, already a smart little business lady with some very good German skills and happy to play Uno with you. Dont miss the chance to spend some wonderdful days to experience an authetic balinese lifestyle. Thanks Buda for the great time! Hope to visit you some day again. Christine","My wife and I stayed at Buda's for a few nights in June and here I am, in the winter 6 months later wishing I was back there.

Buda and his family were very hospitable. We did the cultural tour through the rice fields and learned a bit more about Hinduism, meditation, nature, and the history of the village.

I can't recommend this enough. When we come back to Bali, we will definitely stay with Buda.","Really one of the most beautiful places I've been in my life. In the middle of the Jungle and rice terrace right in front of you. Sadly just stayed there for one night, but I had the pleasure of doing a guided tour with buda to the waterfalls (sekumpul, Fiji and another one I can't even find on the internet)."

We left dissapointed for the food but stisfied with the view!","A peaceful and quiet hideaway place with some simple food (just few dishes) but nicely done.
The view is as green and as natural as it can be)
There is a road that brings you to the Secumpul waterfall from that warung. But be ready to meet local mafia, that pushes you to take the guide and to pay 200k instead of 20-50k. (I didn‚Äôt)",Definitely worth a visit. Oh my gosh. This was a highlight of our Bali trip. This is exactly the rice terrace view that I wanted it was also really nice with the swing. So many opportunities for photos. Great view and food.

If you lose to go waterfall you can ask information on the small shope there..
I will help you to go waterfall
I can tell you our destination and i can bring you to the sekumpul waterfall,, fiji waterfall and screat waterfall..","Small, hidden, very close to sekumpul. Mystical vibes.
The pool is deep though.",Rip off. 250k for a walk. The Secret Garden of Sambangan- not far is a better alternative,"The coordinates to the water fall are wrong. Went around for a while, nothing here. The waterfall is on the other side of the hill. See Jakuzzi waterfalls."

Great service and the hosts are very kind.
Super location in the middle of the nature and the atmosphere you get at dawn is just amazing.
On the other hand, I was proposed to arrange a tour at Sekumpul waterfalls with some local guide even though I was well aware about the scam and all the bad reviews in google maps about the locals trying to scam tourists. Do not fall for it.","One of the best locations we have stayed at in Bali. If you like nature, quietness, hiking and waterfalls, you will love it too.","We had a fantastic stay here! The property is beautiful, we had a fantastic spa package with massages, body scrubs and facials. The breakfast and dinners were good! We also did the tour to the waterfall and our guide was so kind and helpful, he took so many photos! Everyone was so lovely, we felt incredibly well taken care of. We had such an incredible time I highly recommend.","We stayed here for three days. They were too kind for us, and they gave us love. We are so lucky to meet them here. They've become like a family to us. We miss them already. If We come back to Bali, We will definitely stay here again. Stay healthy, everyone. Love you guys and Nataliya.",We had a very nice stay in this Homestay! The family was helping with any requests we had and helped us finding the best waterfall in this village for a cheap entrance fee. We bought a card for 30k each and were able to enter the waterfalls without a guide. The room and its view were amazing and everything was very clean. Especially the son of the owners made our stay at friendly Homestay very nice as he was always there to help us out and provide some drinks.

They offer various excursions and a lot of information.","I had a great stay here. It‚Äôs the perfect place to go see the waterfalls. The Homestay has a tour guide who is amazing, he even bought us some mangosteen and durian to try!!",Me and my partner recently stayed here for 2 nights and we absolutely loved it. It is surrounded by beautiful jungle and we got to see so many insects we have never saw and tried lots of fruit for the first time. The room is basic but cosy. The staff here are super friendly and are always happy to help. We organised a waterfall trip with them and got to trek through the jungle and rice fields seeing fruit trees on the way. It is in a secluded area but they serve food at the homestay so this isn‚Äôt a problem. Would definitely recommend especially if you are visiting Sekumpul and Fiji waterfalls as they are super close.,"Kind owners and a beautiful property. It is rainy here, but their comfortable stay and hot showers help you feel cozy! The wife is so sweet and cooks delicious food, and the husband even threw me a birthday party! They never make you feel bad for asking for things/ help, and we‚Äôre so welcoming. An amazing, too choice Homestay in this area :)"
