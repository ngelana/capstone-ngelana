The fountains apparently no longer work, and the general cleanliness leaves much to be desired.   Nevertheless, it's still a good place to go and cry for those we lost.   I certainly shed my share of tears here.","Always a very special place for me when I drive past after living here for over 20 years.

The land that the Sari Club was in is still vacant after 30 years across the road from the monument.

It brings back memories of probably the best outdoor tropical Bali nucleic bar that has ever existed in Bali with a great dancefloor out the back.

RIP everyone","Excellent day out for individuals or a family.  Various rides to cover all age groups and personal adventure with slow or fast rides.
The payment on the wristband is such a good idea and eleviaites the need to carry a wallet/cash around all day.
Food was good and very reasonable in price.","I felt a duty to attend this location as an Australian. To see all the names and countries  touched by this tragedy is very sad, even after so long. Sadly also it was obvious there was no maintenance going on, broken wiring for the lighting and the fountain empty and in a very poor state.",Horrible event to have happen but nice memorial for relatives to visit and reflect.

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel for a pleasant stay in Kuta","Great location, beautiful surrounding atmosphere, great staff. Most friendly and helpful receptionist and staff ever, lovely and great first impression of hotel. Everything about the hotel was exceptional. Rooms were spotless, and the facilities were well-maintained!!!cleanliness surpassed my expectations!!The room was well equipped and comfortable. I was very pleased with my stay.

It's located on main we can walk a little distance to shop at a great mini market local streets üòÑ

Beds were exceptionally comfortable.
Top-notch pool and spa facilities!!!Great value for the price paid, exceeding our expectations.

We were pleasantly surprised with the complementary breakfast at the Hotel !! They offered all the  standards including different types of breads, fruit, scrambled eggs, sausage,  little egg white omelets, hard boiled eggs, A good English breakfast, variety of sauces to accompany, Chinese noodles, and plenty of flavourful desserts, coffee and fresh juices all of which were prepared well! The service available just near the pool area which makes it pleasant üòÄ","Staff polite, house keeping staff and restaurant staff very good, just confused that why the receptionist refused to give 2 keys for my room, ask twice but they not allow, said that if not enough key the staff can use spare key and  accompany me to the room to open door? Such not convenient if my roommate go out or sleeping. let me feel that may be we will open air conditional all the ways when go out?","I have stayed at Neo+ at 2015 (2 bookings) and we have stayed here this year 2024  again (2 bookings).
The staff is always very welcoming and friendly. You're always greeted with a smile and sometimes we would have a little chat. This counts for all the staff members.
We also had the breakfast included in our booking and the food is always nice and varied.
Also the food from the ala carte menu is good.
The rooms are very nice and are tidied up everyday. The whole atmosphere of the hotel is amazing and has such a relaxed feel to it, although in the center of Kuta. The swimming area is also very nice, since it's secluded within the walls of the hotel.
I would definitely come here again and would recommend others to stay here as well.","Beautiful pool. Lovely complementary drinks. Decent location with lots of stores, bars, restaurants, convenience stores, and massage shops nearby. It can get quite a traffic on peak hours. The rooms are kind of old. Bathroom tile edges are yellow in colour probably just due to age. I do believe they have done the cleaning properly. Beautiful smiley team but inconsistent with what they say. I requested for two room cards but one team told that it‚Äôs not within policy with all sorts of reasons as they only issue one key card even if it‚Äôs two individual guests, next day I requested again and another team gave it straight away."

The first night we stayed room 220 second floor next to the lift, which near the void deck, when inside the room u can hear the noise from first floor restaurant on the loud music and the window side can hear the noise from the clubbing next door till 4am. We cannot sleep well. So Second day, we went to reception, the helpful receptionist helps to change our room to the other side of the first floor room 122. Although, cannot hear the noise of the club next door. But still can hear little music noise from the hotel restaurant. If u are light sleeper, need to consider about it.","I‚Äôll keep it short and sweet - a little grungy and needs a repaint of the bedroom walls (stain sprayed across the wall) and a DEEP DEEP clean of the bathroom. The moldy shower is off putting. But that being said, the towels and bed were clean which is the minimum to ask for and it was received and sufficient. It‚Äôs in a party area of town, and my partner and I aren‚Äôt party people, so I guess we stayed in the wrong spot. When we asked about a taxi to the airport (which I thought airport transfer was free) they said 150,000. I scheduled a grab instead and paid 69,000. If I didn‚Äôt score an awesome last minute deal for this hotel, and if I paid the full price, I would be very very very disappointed.","Location is very close to the night life in legian Street, super noisy! Strong beat and music coming right to your room until 4 am.

Not recommend this hotel if you traveling with family, I booked 3 rooms for family trip, but unfortunately will never come back here again.

The room wasn't cool smells like old house when we check in, the AC isn't on, the window is open, the amenities in the bathroom seems like they haven't use it for awhile smells moldy.

The shower didn't work properly, and the shower area isn't bright at all. Need some maintenance, chair in the restaurant isn't comfortable.

With this price, I am sure you can get better place around kuta.","Good hotel at a vibrant location. Eventhough it is in the middle of the city the rooms are quiet. Good rooms, nice service and good breakfast

The barista is very kind to me. I asked him what is the best option for coffee that I can have. And he gave me a list of good options. I think coffee is the best here. I have not tried the non-coffee options yet, so I cannot tell you. But you must come here for coffee. It really sparks your brain :)))
The environment is undoubtedly good. I love the atmosphere here. Though I came in the early morning, and I am the only guest here so it is definitely not crowded now :))). The music is harmonious, soft and ear-catching. The smell is good. There is no smoking smell yet (might be as I am the only guest herr). The light is enough, comfortable for me.

I didn't have high expectations for an economy hotel so I'll try to be nice.

The rooms I got was spacious but not much functionality to it. I was unlucky enough to get the more secluded area with the other swimming pool with eerie vibes all around as it's way too quiet compared to the main pool area.

Even though the workers were nice and weren't rude, the service was subpar as it took an hour to prepare a for a room and the floor wasn't mopped properly, and was still dusty after we requested to clean it again.

Breakfast was okay. I got served poached eggs that weren't poached eggs, and they were pretty slow at restocking the food but the food is overall okay.

Vinal verdict: 3 stars for an Okay hotel. It could be a 2 star rating on a bad day and a bad room location but it's all to be expected from an economy hotel. Overall okay üôè","Upon checking in, we were greeted with a smile, complimentary drink of OJ was given to us while they processed our rooms. We were given a room upgrade as I was a member of asr hotels. Kudos to staff on thatüëç. Service was very very good unlike the last 7 days of stay in ibis hotel Legian( horrible). Surrounding us has a good food places and it‚Äôs only 5-7mins ride to Kuta, Legian and Seminyak. The only problem with this hotel is the heavy traffic outside from 10am-10pm. Other than that good location and nice renovated roomsü´°üëç. Price wise it‚Äôs way cheaper then ibis style Legian!","Sufficient Place.if you only need to get sleep. No decent facilities for sure.
Size of the room great for family.
Amenities sufficient.
Fit for family looking for a huge room with decent amenities","Family room was quite spacious but luckily i only stayed for 1 night.  This hotel must be renovated.! Rusted railing along the corridor, peeled paint, broken tiles in pool, broken downlight in many places, dark basement, dirty river view, broken AC so we have to changed room, rusted refrigerator, outdated furniture, curved bed that hurts my back..!!

They also top up cold water bottle every day for us. Smell of the hotel was nice. I can't wait to come back to this wonderful hotel!","Relatively small room for 5*.
Fridge mini bar empty,
Shower - small shower head.
Well here in small things you can notice that there is no feeling that in 5* hotel.
But for 4* is very good, and the price tag is 4*.
Where did they get the fifth star from? I don't understand.
On top of all that, it took us 40 minutes to check in. Although the usual quiet and free day, there were no queues.
They just couldn't find a reservation for a long time, and all that.","The hotel is terrible. There is no drop off area for cars. The rooms are dirty, we found bed bugs in our room. We didn‚Äôt get the room we booked. The reception staff are unfriendly. The worst hotel in Bali. Never been asked to pay a deposit for the room key. Defiantly not a 5 Star hotel.","My partner and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. What I liked:
- Front desk staff were nice and accommodating
- Ample parking space
- Clean gym with sufficient equipment
- Room is clean. We stayed in a Deluxe Room with one queen bed. I think this is best for solo business travellers or couples esp that the bathroom is enclosed in frosted glass
- Decent and sufficient breakfast with good Indonesian dishes. If you like fancy breakfast, go elswhere
- location is near minimarts and Kuta Square so it will be easy to find other places to eat
What I didnt like (in fact, what I hated)

- the electricity in the room cuts off at exactly 12noon. Reception did not inform us that when we checked in. We had no intention of overstaying but the hotel should also give a little grace period for check out. Front desk staff called at almost 12noon to inform of the checj out time and I said, that yes we were going to check out. I was in the middle of finishing my packing when the electricity when out. It wa such a horrible experience. It felt like the hotel was kicking us out. The least the staff could have done was inform us of the check out time AND that the electricity will be cut off and then ask if we needed a little more time. She only offered the grace period AFTER the fact, when I went down to complain. I hope this gets improved.","The experience upon entering this hotel was very poor. We booked a queen-size bed, but at the front desk, they claimed only rooms with two small beds combined were available. Upon entering the room, it was filled with the smell of smoke. Interestingly, the front desk warned about fines for smoking in the room during check-in. We requested a room change, but the staff kept sending people to inspect the room, checking the air conditioning and spraying air freshener. When we requested a refund at the front desk, suddenly they claimed there was a room available. The entire process wasted a lot of our time, from waiting for room inspections to moving our luggage around.

Later, we asked the front desk if we could borrow a bowl for instant noodles. They directed us to the restaurant, where the staff insisted the noodles needed cooking, but we had no tools. Despite asking for help, they refused, stating it was outside food. The hotel provided us with plates that were useless for preparing instant noodles. The overall service and quality were disappointing, and it's hard to believe this is a five-star hotel. We've stayed in more affordable and better-serviced hotels in Bali, making this experience a waste of money and regrettable."

The room was tidy, and cleaned every day, although small ants could be spotted in few places (but they could've hitchhiked with us from the previous place).

The pool was fortunately shaded from the sun and offered refreshment after the day at the beach. The facilities and design is quite modern but few places could be fixed - pool was missing some tiles and had exposed wire, fortunately no power.

There is about 1.7km walk to the beach, pavement almost all the way. The scooter rental can be found about 800m north as well.

(RECEPTION ASKED ME to MOVE TO ANOTHER TABLE at the OTHER SIDE of the LOBBY where the A.C. is NOT WORKING because OF A NEW GROUP ALTHOUGH I was ALREADY SITTING and HAD ALREADY STARTED EATING MY FOOD and THE GROUP WAS ONLY 4 men and 5 women and there were 3 EMPTY TABLES...it was just so RUDE & DISRESPECTFUL)"

Good location though.
Staff are nice & helpful too.",Rooms are decent but AC in the room was too small for the size of room. So you won't get enough cooling and breakfast is average.. the bread was very hard and other rice and noodle items were not good.,"My stay at the hotel provided a mixed experience, garnering an overall 3-star rating. The service deserves a commendable 4 stars for its efficiency and attentiveness, ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The staff exhibited a high level of professionalism and responsiveness, contributing positively to the overall experience.

One standout feature was the hotel's prime location, earning a solid 5 stars. Situated in the heart of Bali, it provided convenient access to clubs, restaurants, shopping, and various entertainment options. This central positioning undoubtedly enhanced the stay, making exploration and leisure activities easily accessible.

However, the room itself received a more modest 3-star rating. While functional and clean, it lacked some of the finer touches that elevate a stay to a higher level. Room amenities were satisfactory but didn't quite match the expectations set by the excellent service and prime location.

In summary, the hotel offers a well-rounded experience with notable strengths in service and location. While the room may not reach the same heights, the overall stay was satisfactory, making it a reasonable choice for those prioritizing convenience and attentive service in the heart of Bali.",It‚Äôs in the central of kl.

Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è (5/5)

I recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Restu Bali in Kuta, and my experience was truly remarkable. From the moment I walked in, I was impressed by the warm and welcoming atmosphere. The hotel's location, right in the heart of Kuta, made it incredibly convenient to explore the area's attractions.

The staff at Hotel Restu Bali went above and beyond to ensure my comfort during my stay. From the front desk to the housekeeping team, everyone was attentive and friendly, always ready to assist with a smile. The check-in process was smooth, and any questions or requests I had were promptly addressed.

The rooms were spacious, clean, and beautifully designed. I particularly enjoyed the comfortable bed and the stunning view from my window. The hotel's attention to detail in room amenities and decor truly enhanced the overall experience.

One of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's dining options. The on-site restaurant offered a diverse menu of local and international dishes, all prepared to perfection. The breakfast buffet was a delightful start to each day, featuring a variety of fresh and delicious options.

Hotel Restu Bali also boasts impressive facilities, including a relaxing pool area where I spent some leisurely afternoons. The spa services were a rejuvenating treat, and I left feeling completely relaxed and pampered.

The proximity of the hotel to Kuta's famous beach and vibrant nightlife added to the overall allure. Whether I wanted to spend a day on the sand or explore the local shops and markets, everything was just a short walk or drive away.

In conclusion, Hotel Restu Bali provided an exceptional experience during my time in Kuta. The combination of excellent service, comfortable accommodations, and prime location makes it an ideal choice for both leisure and business travelers. I can't wait to return for another memorable stay.","Shared room and bathrooms are very dirty, there were hairs on bed sheet, not hot water at shower. I don‚Äôt recommend at all.
