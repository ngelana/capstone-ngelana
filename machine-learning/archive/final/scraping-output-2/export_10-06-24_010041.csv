The price of the acomodation was very cheap.For me, the location was perfect. Even though it's 15 minutes from Echo Beach by motorbike, the area is quieter, and there are many places to eat around for half the price. There is a gym 5 minutes from the place bro gym which cost 45 k the day pass. The garden views are just amazing. I will come back! üôå","I stayed at dorm, and the facilities of the dorm is old and some not working. Beds are squeaky. No shower head. No water coming to the toilet tank and cannot flush.","The rooms were spacious and clean, the common areas were welcoming, and the co-working space had reliable high-speed internet and a great community of like-minded professionals. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and productive work environment while exploring Bali.","Amazing hostel, so clean and amazing environment for people working whilst travelling, very chilled environment with great people.

The staff here are amazing, shout out to them. They keep the place really clean and are so friendly, there's such a nice family environment there. Big shout out to Putu, Duey and Agus! Those guys made our stay really special. Those guys deserve top salaries! They work so hard all day long to do everything for the guests. 100% recommend the hostel.","A great clean hostel, with a peaceful set up garden made for inspiration, beautiful workspace upstairs, a nice lil kitchen and a neat spot to create! Staff are very smiley and helpful! It‚Äôs an 8 minute ride from the beach, you can actually sleep in there not like the most hostels, and great for entrepreneurs! I definitely recommend it for everyone except party travelers! Will defo be back!"

Best sushi rolls i ever had in Bali! Everything is great about them.

The next thing is that underneath the box, there is a bagvof ice, ro keep the dish cool during deliveryüíü In Philadelphia rolls the perfect amount of cheese and fish, properly cooked rice. The price is maybe higher than in most other places, but if you like sushi rolls, its worth trying at least onceüíü","Best Sushi Experience in Bali! üç£

From the first bite to the last, the taste was unparalleled. The chef's dedication to crafting each piece with precision and using the freshest ingredients truly shines through in every dish. The flavors are a symphony of perfection that left my taste buds dancing with joy. üëåüèº

Not only does this place offer the best taste in town, but the quality of their sushi is unmatched. The fish is incredibly fresh, and the rice is expertly seasoned. Each roll is a work of art, showcasing the chef's passion for creating an authentic sushi experience. But it doesn't stop there ‚Äì the attention to detail extends to the packaging as well. The presentation is impeccable, and the packaging is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical. My sushi arrived in perfect condition, a testament to their commitment to delivering the best possible experience to their customers.

In summary, if you're a sushi lover seeking the best taste, highest quality ingredients, and impeccable packaging in Canggu, look no further than Philadelphia Bali. It's a culinary journey that exceeded my expectations. I'll definitely be returning for more soon!","Im a sushi lover and am quite picky about the quality. And I can tell you those are the best sushi I‚Äôve ever eaten! All ingredients are super fresh and tasty, minimum rice - maximum seafood. Love it!
Got addicted, same my whole family and friends who ever tried those - you try them once and you can never order from another sushi place :)","Absolutely delicious sushi! Ordered via WhatsApp and had it delivered to our hotel in Kuta and it was still amazing despite the distance. We ordered the Philadelphia set and Canggu Set as seen in the photos. Enjoyed every bit of it, even the ginger was amazing! Keep up the good work. Will definitely order again when back in Bali.","Best sushi in my life!! Very friendly staff, great boxes and serving. Lots of food - delicious!"

Thanks to Dom, Pak Yoga, Chef Bagus and the rest of the staff! Highly recommended!","We had a great time at Bali Brothers place where we stayed for a month. Domenico and Frank, our host with their friendly and cheerful attitude. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. The food was so delicious from their bar. We liked their homemade pasta, nasi goreng, chicken curry and coffee. I would absolutely recommend staying there!","This location deserves a higher rating. This guest house has a distinct Bali vibe. The apartments are really roomy, spotless, and equipped with everything. If you want to see something in Bali that is off the beaten path, Dominico, Frank, and the staff are very informed and helpful.

Food is both tasty and reasonably priced.
When I return to Bali, this is where I'll be staying.

Can't have asked for a nicer final four days in Bali.
