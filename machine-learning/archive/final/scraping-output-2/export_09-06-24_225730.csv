The people are extraordinary - the food is world-class, and the hospitality is second to none. This is one of the most remarkable places in the world.  What a joy!!","DO NOT LET YOUR DRIVER OR ANYONE TAKE YOU HERE. Tourist trap. Awful experience. Terrible portions, high prices, horrible food with flies in it and disgusting bathrooms. Terrible service too. What a ripoff. Avoid at all costs! RUDE AS WELL. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Did not want to give even a STAR! Also doesn't have a card option to pay.","The prices in general are more than any restaurant we've been to. Side dishes are not included, so you have to pay extra for those. And the portions are even smaller than any restaurant we ate at the past 4-5 days. Basically it was one chicken wing with rice. Be prepared you'll end up in another restaurant eating another main course. The food was good though but it's a pity the food is pricey for such a small portion.",I had lunch here with my stundents. The food is good. If you want to have lunch with you family it is better come here earlier or later than the normal lunch time. It will be packed and you will not feel comfortable during the normal lunch time. It think it is nice to enjoy a cup of coffee in the afternoon because of the surrounding views and cool air. The owner amd staff are really nice. Good service,"Stop here in the way to Pura Ulun Danu and I must say the view in this restaurant is nice üòä
The menu have quite a variety and the food taste good.
They also gave us nice appetizers to enjoy while waiting for the food.
For a local restaurant, the price is average, the portion is quite small though.
The bathroom is okay. Good experience üòä"

Overall just stop by here if you want to take a snack time and get a great view of the mountains,"Food OK, not great and not expensive. Perhaps the buffet lunch is better.

It's a place to rest on the way. Friendly staff. The background music keeps repeating.","We stopped by on our way to see some waterfalls and filled up on some good food. We got two nasi goreng meals, a shrimp dish, fried fish, coffee, and soda for around $15! The view was awesome and the air was crisp and cool!",Friendly and fast service. Had the grilled/fried chicken. Very good but was super spicy. Even for us even though we like spicy food

It is perfect to enjoy in the cold high altitude of Bedugul.

Service was nice, location is strategic and they have spacious parking. The knly thing to improves is their cleanliness of the facility a little bit.","Nasi Tempong indra is a local indonesian restaurant that has now 5 locations across Bali. One of their location is opened in Bedugul.

We went here, because the prices were rock bottom low compare to the other restaurant in bedugul area ! The atmosphere was excellent.

We have tried on the lunch, nasi tempong ayam 1/4 Idr 38k. It‚Äôs possibly the best fried chicken in bedugul,¬† big claims, but it really is that good. The coating on the outside is insanely crispy, and the actual chicken meat is perfectly seasoned and juicy, reminded us of the peking crispy duck from the pink tempong restaurant.

Finding something cheap with good advantages (great location, clean toilets, huge parking lot, fast service)¬† in the tourisity area to enjoy is hard work, but look no further ! Just go to nasi tempong indra bedugul, the charm and friendliness will blow you away¬† üíñ‚ú®Ô∏è","Nasi Tempong Indra Bedugul totally rocks! The food and service are a solid 5 stars - seriously, it's that good. The only thing is, the spot isn't super pretty, but honestly, who cares when the food is this awesome? Check it out! üåüüçõüòÑ","Food was great.

Service was abysmal. Waiter lost our order list / checker twice so our order got put behind so many people that came later than us. We had to repeat our order twice. Once? Okay understandable, stuff happens. Twice??? Now we‚Äôve got a problem. We waited an hour when usually it would take 30 minutes tops (the menu is nothing complicated, you just gotta fry and assemble stuff)

Parking is small, not equipped to handle a large crowd.","I always like nasi tempong. But this first experience was not really a pleasant one. They only have nasi tempong ayam and hot drinks. No other items are available from the menu. They also dont have the salted fried fish which is one of the typical nasi tempong. And so many flies, annoying while eating. Plus after eating, there were no water running for washing hands. Really.."

They have plenty of indoor seating but the outside seating is beautifully done with plenty of umbrellas to provide shade on sunny days.
The staff was very attentive, saw me arrive and were waiting at the door for me. I had my order within a few minutes.
Would definitely recommend stoping by when in the area.","Very delicious food, good service. I ended up ordering 2 of theseüòã",This is my first time visiting this place.

What I don't like are :
Place full of flies, even our car got flies on it. I know it's hard to do anything about it but they're disturbing. Good food could be average because of it.
Full speaker.. Gosh.. Idk why they had to put full volume, we could barely talk. They can't listen to our order.

And I know it's near holiday and maybe they're not in the mood but I'd really like to greet with honest smile than with half hearted one.","Located around Bedugul Area

spacey parking space
4-5 toilets available

Restaurant with Views",Mie Ayam more influence with Chinese flavors. The quality and tastes was okay.

Good view of rice paddies. Tables are good for working, though no outlets. A bit noisy from the nearby road.","Location: In the middle of the main road of bedugul.
Restaurant: There were many windows (The walls are made out of class with frames) so you could get a nice view while eating. Even a comfortable couch to sit was there. Overall a comforting ambient.
Food: I ordered a Nasi Goreng for 18k idr which got me a fairly big portion.
I also ordered a cold Cappuccino to which they also gave a small dessert (it was something like a little pudding with a slight coffee taste to it) for free!
I also recommend the banana pancake very tasty and buttery.
But the highlight of the food was the Sate Ayam Aultan Sigug. It had plenty of flavours and just the right amount of spice to enjoy with your nasi goreng. In my Opinion the best Sate I‚Äôve ever had in Bali.
Overall: Experience 10/10 would come here again.
Extra: The special thing about the restaurant is also that it‚Äôs split in two, meaning that you have two small buildings to dine in (the kitchen) or just to stop by and drink a coffee (the cafe). It also had a litte counter where you could buy some local snacks like e.g. rempeyek.
Would recommend trying this on your way trough bedugul. 10/10. Very good ambiance and friendly staff.","The food was average, coffee was not bad, the staff is very nice",,
