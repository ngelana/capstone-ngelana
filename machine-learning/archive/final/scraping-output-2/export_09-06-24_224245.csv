There are several spots where you have to pay for parking. there are also those who don't need to pay. For motorbikes, a parking fee of 2 thousand rupiah is charged. If you want to feed the monkeys you will be charged 15 thousand and you will get a basket of fruit and bread. for peanuts you will be charged 15 thousand for 2 plastic bags. You can play with monkeys and enjoy very beautiful views. But be careful with the monkey because some monkeys can‚Äôt cooperate üôè","made a stop here waiting for friends left in the back.

turned to be an interesting spot of monkey tribe and beautiful landscape.","Make sure to have a stop around here. There is a great view down onto the lakes and funny monkeys.
Be aware that some people will try to sell you ""monkey food"" if you stop there and take photos.","We had such a great stay. View is amazing, people are super friendly and great food. If staying in the area this is the place to stay.","So nice for a quick rest area! I was riding my motorcycle from singaraja to canggu. Went. here just for a quick coffee (i also bring my own pork satay). No need to buy tickets, just park my bike then go (there's no parking fee)"

We went on a rainy day and during the day, so there were many tourists and our pictures didn‚Äôt turn out to be great",A photogenic temple is floating on the lake. One of the best tourist spots in Bali. The trip could be combined between Singaraja and this temple where both of them should you visit during a holiday in Bali üëçüëçüëç,"This is a quiet temple located beside lake Buyan.
Must more quiet & less tourists than Beratan Temple.
View was very good beside the lake & it is a small temple.
Worth a visit if you are on your way from Beratan Temple to Munduk or vice versa.
There is no entrance fee required though.","February 2022: Entrance fee 75 000, moto parking fee 3000.
One of the nicest places in Bali. It was pretty busy by indonesiam tourists but so peaceful at the same time. No annoying pushy sellers. So refreshing. There are some restaurants and stores if you want to get a drink/food. Also loads of greenery where you can do a little picnic. Big and calm place. Beautiful mountain views.
Visiting bathroom costs another 2000.
If you come from the south dont forget some warmer clothes, it's quite chilly up there.","All the photos on Google are wrong! This is just a campsite with a small Hindu shrine, and costs 10,000 IDR per person. There is nothing else. A lot of the photos on Google are actually of Beratan, the shrine on the lake, which is nearby."

Many monkeys here, don't forget to bring your banana. Be careful car stop here very close to the road & up hill","Not all the monkeys are very polite üòÇ but cool for a quick Stop, if you are passing anyways",A place with great views and monkeys!),"Nice spot to meet a gang of monkeys and to take amazing photos of the lakes. Some monkeys are not polite, beware them. If you have time it is nice nice idea to stop for a few minutes."
