The positive was the entire facility was beautiful and clean. The staff were friendly and transport was easy. The room itself was very nice and spacious. The negative was, we paid for a pool terrace room which we were not given. I informed Reception staff that I wasn‚Äôt happy with the room compared to what I paid and they said they would follow up with me but never did. I also mentioned that the shower smelt bad, had very poor pressure and wouldn‚Äôt heat up above warm (We had friends staying at the same time and their shower was amazing compared to ours), this issue raised was also just lip service from Reception staff. When we checked out, I enquired about a charge on our invoice but was told it was signed for, but for the life of myself and my wife, we should not of had any charges to the room that day. We were also not given any amendment to the invoice after we were given a lesser room that what we paid for. Such a beautiful place that had the staff followed up with me when we raised concerns would have made the review perfect.","A beautiful experience, the staff are so friendly and helpful.
Food is extremely delicious and flavourful. This resort is amazing  exactly what you need to relax. So happy, and definitely well worth.
Highly recommended üòäüôè","A quiet and peaceful resort suitable for family who would like to have a relaxing trip. We had an amazing stay with this resort mainly because of their exceptional customer service from each of the working staff. My kids loved their pools and I loved their breakfast spread. Kids club was amazing too with very attentive and caring staff though is a bit small. There are daily activities for both adults and kids. The room was a quite damn and would be good if their bath tub is closed up because when the kids play in the bath tub, it splashed everywhere. I had to keep wiping. Overall, we would still return because of their above and beyond service.","This hotel is really remarkable,all facilities and design are unique and cozy. The service   was excellent and the staffs are attentive and honest. We left the pouch bag at the lobby and it was kept with savely by the front desk staff. Thank you to Mr.Mikael the front desk  staff who took care of it while we looked for it and handled nicely.We recommend this hotel to all and return back  to stay while in Bali.Thank you.","I am a lifetime Platinum Marriott member and I must say I was impressed with this property. It is very modern, clean, and comfortable. All of the staff and personnel are super friendly and dedicated to ensure a pleasant stay. The front desk manager Simon went above and beyond to ensure everything went smoothly and was very friendly and hospitable. I would definitely go back to this hotel again and cant wait until the next visit. Thanks again"

This is probably one of the best Marriott vacation club resorts I‚Äôve stayed in so far. I hated Bali,
But I loved the resort. The property is shared with the renaissance hotel so you immediately get a touch of added luxury in every part of your stay. Check in was smooth, a personal concierge takes down your phone number and messages you through whatsapp to ensure your stay is perfect. The villa we got was luxurious, comfortable, and complete. Wooden accents, large shower, indoor
Balcony pool, full kitchen, etc.  The hotel has 4 enormous pool, each with its own theme and vibe. Swim some laps in the long infinity renaissance pool, chill by the pond pool, take your kids to the large kids pool or enjoy the family pool with a bar and restaurant.  After a long day of enjoying there are three separate restaurants to enjoy. Chinese, world, and Mediterranean options. The breakfast was the BEST part of the stay. I have never stayed at a hotel with such a variety of options and great quality. Great price for all that is offered.
Besides all the amazing pools, restaurants, lobby and decor‚Ä¶..The garden and landscaping is impeccable. they offer a 24 hour gym with a personal trainer, which is in a separate building where you can also find the spa.","A world class hotel. Love the atmosphere and the facilities provided. The fitness center and the lobby are huge.

The staff was all friendly and well trained

The breakfast was okay. I‚Äôve had places with much more options and better taste but overall for the price it was decent.

Would still love to come back next time.","I had the privilege of spending my hens week at this beautiful resort with my closest friends and oh my god what a fantastic holiday it was!
The hotel is just stunning with the most spectacular rooms, immaculately kept lawns, delicious food, and the most relaxing atmosphere overall. The gym and the spa facilities are so nicely kept and I would love to thank all the special ladies that work in the massage section for making me and my friends feel a million bucks!
Another special mention to the boys by the pool especially Yande, Budi and Desu for going above and beyond and making sure we were always having fun and relaxing.
We loved the Marriot so much that we left the premises a total of 3 times over the 5 days to go see rest of Bali üòÇ it was just so nice to stay there and enjoy the facilities.
Cannot wait to be back!","I had the most wonderful stay with 5 friends last week.
the villas was so luxe, the food was amazing we loved the breakie buffet. The pool was beautiful and so relaxing with incredible cocktails. We loved the spa treatments and the resort grounds are stunning and are kept prisitine by the great grounds people. Not only that but the staff are amazing, the guys working around the pool area making sure we were comfortable, well fed and had a drink! Especially Yande who went above and Beyond  to make sure we had a great time. Desu and Budi were also very welcoming and accommodating to us. The hospitality is top notch
Also Siti, the therapist I had at the spa who gave me an incredible treatment walked away feeling very relaxed. Thank you","Nice resort with good service. 2br apartment is nice with well equipped kitchen, washing machine and dishwasher. Can use grab service to order cheaper and nicer food. Free Shuttle bus runs hourly to take you to bali collection and beach.mineral water bottles generously given and topped up daily, with coffee and tea. Will recommend for chill family resort holidays..near to airport with the new toll bridge. Far from other places like ubud and seminyak."

As a relatively new establishment in Bali, it enjoys a high occupancy rate. While smaller in size compared to Backstage, Tanah Liat offers a comparable selection of buffet. During our visit, we were impressed by the freshness and delectable taste of the breakfast menu.","The food here is delicious. The seafood bisque is flavorful, made with fresh ingredients that shine through. The squid ink pasta with lobster exceeded expectations, and was one of the best pastas we've eaten. The seafood flavor of the sauce paired well with the slight spiciness. It was a good dining experience.","At first we were skeptical about the restaurant because there was only one table next to ours, but we gave it a try anyway.

It turned out to be one of the best meals we've had during our stay in Bali. The seafood was really fresh and tasty. My highlight was the eggplant parmigiana. I never thought I could eat this dish so tasty outside of Italy.","Where do I start‚Ä¶.

Sindhu was the gentleman waiting our table for dinner.

He provided possibly the best service I‚Äôve had at a restaurant of this calibre. His suggestions based on our preferences were perfect for both drinks and food choices.

I am a fussy eater with no love for seafood but was able to say that I enjoyed the squid and the carpaccio!!

Will definitely return on my next visit to Bali.

Thank you Sindu üôèüèΩ","Very high quality food and service, great for a quiet romantic dinner.... if you have children, go next door to the Backstahe Restaurant so you don't ruin the adults experience. 5-star quality, at reasonable prices."

The staff exhibited professionalism and friendliness, enhancing the overall experience. The delicious food surpassed my expectations, and the tasteful decoration added to the inviting ambiance. A highlight was meeting the executive Chinese chef- Alex adding a personal touch to an already delightful evening. Highly recommended for those seeking a memorable dining experience.","What a lovely ambience to eat one of the most amazing meals I have had - the long live noodle, fresh veg dim sums were so hearty and well presented. The chef served it himself with so much love. The ambience was very tasteful and all the staff who were there elevated the entire experience. Lanang stood out with his great recommendations and friendly attitude.","We had a positive experience overall and particularly enjoyed the service and atmosphere, as well as the pleasing decorations. While the food was good, it was not above and beyond.

The eggplant dish stood out as a highlight of our meal. Soft shell crab, black pepper beef and cooked veggie with garlic were neither bad nor fantastic.","Good food, nice ambience, the waiter named Joni is very helpful and attentive. The beef mongolian and chicken kungpao are tasty. The crispy pork belly also very generous portion",I have been this restaurant a couple of times. Everything about this restaurant was great. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations especially Joani and Irani.The food is amazing and very nice presentation.

We ordered the soup buntut and pork ribs. Soup buntut was very nice! The oxtail beef was sooo tasty even without the soup! It was sooo tender that needs literally zero effort to separate the meat from the bone. Pork ribs ware cooked with balinese herbs. If you are a fan of balinese taste, you will like it! Portion was also quite big. Enough to make me full all night long!","One of the restaurants at the Renaissance Hotel Nusa Dua offers a delightful breakfast experience. They provide a wide variety of meats, cheeses, fresh cold-pressed juices, cakes, and more. What makes it stand out for me is the interior design and ambiance.","pleasant atmosphere, good service, for me the food is so-so, lots of wine on the menu but the wine we wanted to order was a shame it wasn't available by the bottle","We had a relatively late dinner at 8 plus on a Sunday night. First off, the decor is stunning. I was very impressed by the whole industrial grunge vibe. The menu was an interesting fusion of East and West. We liked the pumpkin soup, rendang pizza, salmon and tenderloin steak. Drinks and desserts were a hit-and-miss, but service staff was friendly and gave us good shopping recommendations.","Breakfast buffet has a lot variety, a la cart menu is great too."
