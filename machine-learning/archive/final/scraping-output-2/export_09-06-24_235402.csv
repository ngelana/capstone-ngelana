Donations are appreciated but not required. I donated though.
Lots of young children from local areas were swimming there. Only saw boys there for some reason during my visit.  They were very friendly and enjoyed my company.
Great place to relax and swim. Very shallow water (under 4.5 feet).
Be careful inside the swimming area as the rocks are rough and you can get scratched easily. The water was clean and very refreshing.","Ok, I don't know what to say. The hike is super steep.sometimes you don't know if it's a path. I got down and there was the kids, boys, in the pool. Well, they didn't really reply for my greetings and as they were all early teenage boys and I am a 30yo solo female.... the stares didn't feel comfortable and there is no place to sit down or look around or something so I left immediat3lly. Tuesday 1pm. The place is beautiful..... if you could actually go.

Ps: ok,15 mins later these kids, max.13 yo, left on the motorcycles...... well, not going the path again.","Very bumpy bike ride to get there, in a rural setting with a bit of a hike once you reach the end of the driven part. However, the pool is absolutely beautiful and very peaceful. Incredible scenery.","The place is so beautiful, we didn't find a waterfall but there was a sort of pool and it was anyway amazing","Need 10-15 minutes walk to reach the spring. Didn't seem to be actively maintained, but still beautiful. The water is clean and refreshing. A nice place to visit when you're around the area."

Young guy on reception so helpful. No hot water in our room but let us use other room, shower nice and hot. Location need a car. 2 - 5 min drive from the villas are Warungs for Bakso, fried chicken etc. Also Mini mart nearby.","Overall the villa & view are beautiful. But to get there is such a hell ride. It's not in ubud ( my mistake not to search before), about north of Ubud, Tegal Alang. Very much a traditional place. There's convenience store about 500m but you have to borrow a bike from reception. Lack of service and staff.. this is best place to isolate yourself (in a good way)","Amazing experience!
What a very comfortable property for a holiday. Relaxing place, and facilities are awesome. Have a very good day in the pool, having coffee and enjoy sunrise in the morning. Great service by the staff, since we arrived till check out.
Will come back another chance üëå",Worth it for the price...Just need to eat in the restaurant cos no nice foods around there.,Worth it the price
