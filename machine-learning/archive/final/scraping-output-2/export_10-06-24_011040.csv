A lovely woman handed us a flower and incense and helped us a little ü•∞

I would have liked more information or had someone explain the meaning of the temple before going inside but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.

The entrance is narrow but only for a second whilst you get inside, not claustrophobic at all.

I believe entrance is 50.000 as this is what everyone donates, you sign a guestbook upon arrival and pay before entering the cave.

Sarongs can be rented for 10.000 at the bottom of the stairs or you can bring your own ‚ò∫Ô∏è","üåº Best thing I did on Penida!
A beautiful experience, a gorgeous temple, a steep walk to get up there and a leisurely one on the way out.
10k to rent a sarong, with cheap water for sale there too.
The climb in wasn‚Äôt as scary as I thought- if you‚Äôre of average build with a backpack, you‚Äôll be more than okay.
It is, obviously, not accessible by those who have mobility issues or who would struggle to crawl.
It‚Äôs beautiful inside but you need to be quiet and respectful, so be mindful when bringing children.
I was invited to pray with a Balinese family and the blessing and service was incredible.
When you walk out, keep going straight, don‚Äôt go up the decorated stairs! I went the wrong way as there‚Äôs no signs.
The walk out has rubbish around it, but this is an undeveloped island with heavy touristic footfall- what else would you expect, unfortunately.
50k entrance is well worth it","A temple in a cave.So unique and different experience.You can rent a sarong from the small shop selling drinks if you do not have one.There‚Äôs a donation box where you need to pay 20,000 IDR per person.Walk up a set of stairs upwards and from there you have to enter the cave.Its said to be a secret cave for purification and Healing.At certain point only Balinese locals are allowed to enter.There is artificial lights so you won‚Äôt be in dark.By the other end of the cave you can get out which has 10 minutes walk back from the main entrance.The walk offers a beautiful scenic view of small valleys.
Must visit when in Nusa Penida","When you arrive in front of the pathway to the temple, you are required to pay to rent a sarong in order to enter the temple. However, climbing the stairs up to the cave with sarong is not an easy feat. Please be careful. When arriving at the entrance of the cave, you will need to make a donation to enter the cave temple, and they will offer you a cup of disposable water. When entering, please make sure to wear shoes, not slippers. I wore slippers and slipped my way down into the cave temple üòÖ. Luckily, I wasn't hurt. It's very dark, you can hear the bats making noises. It is huge from the inside. Although they have a lot of space, they didn't have a lot of things placed in the cave. We spotted a few of the temple staff resting in the cave with fan blowing at them üòÇ. After walking to the end of the cave, you will need to walk down a flight of stairs to ground level. Upon reaching ground level, you will walk down a street at the back of people's houses, filled with trash, to get to the street you came from.","- Need to wear sarong (rent cost 10k IDR)
- Need to donate to temple 50k IDR per person (entrance fee to temple by forcing donation)
- Need to walk up by stairs because the temple is on the hill, way into the cave a bit  tiny but inside is big and way out must walk all around to get back to front
- Peaceful place, few tourists"

They don't clean the floors of toilets properly.

The worst hotel I stayed in, and surprising because many other hotels in Bali are very good and affordable.

Also, blackout middle of night for 2-3 hours, and no staff or anyone in the facility to help out.

Oh, and after complaining about bad smell from washroom, the caretaker came and sprayed a bunch of insecticide. It was so strong that we ended up wearing mask while sleeping, and there were dead insects everywhere.

Worst experience ever.","My stay at this hotel was extremely disappointing. Despite reserving a room with an ocean view, we were initially placed in a regular room. Only after expressing our dissatisfaction were we relocated to the correct room, after the belongings of other guests were moved without their consent‚Äîa very unprofessional approach. Additionally, we had to repeatedly request clean towels and toilet paper. The breakfast provided was of poor quality, lacking basic amenities like tea or coffee. The bathroom was disgustingly dirty, with visible mold. Overall, this experience left us very unhappy.","Honest Review: No Privacy. The helper would walk in through the pool side door unannounced. And they put all booking information on their front board with guest names & their room numbers! The only decent thing is the fact that you can see the sea IF you sit by the pool. Everything else is poor. Bathrooms were disgusting, TV not working, poor breakfast & service. The pool gets dirty by stray animals. OVER PRICED. Go for other cheaper alternatives.","Stayed in the ocean view room. Awesome simple rooms with everything you need. Beautiful sunrises. The staff was so friendly ‚ò∫Ô∏è ( ask for coconuts, YES FREE )  really enjoyed it here.  The east side of the island is way more local and less touristy and that's exactly why you should come here. The energy of your surroundings and the friendliness from locals on the east side is unbeatable. I wish we would've booked there longer instead of staying at the west side",The pool is right next to beach . It was full moon when we stayed so swimming next to ocean watching moon was an unforgettable experience. In morning water level decreases so u can walk further in the beach. We saw crab and starfish . I highly recommend this place . Though this place is far from popular destination but since nusa penida is small island u can easy get around within a hour so we didnt mind it . It was peachful and for the price point it was our best stay in our entire journey in indonesia. The owners are also really nice and helpful.

No toilet paper provided, they left less than half. Swimming pool is nice but the rooms not much.

Also, the breakfast was very little. I don recommend this place at all.","Rats everywhere!!!!!!! We booked this for 2 nights and only stayed one as there were bite marks on my girlfriends phone, which was on the nightstand right beside her head. Friends also dealt with rats biting through her bag. Once we told staff about their rat infestation, they became rude and would not refund our second night.

If you wanna sleep with rats, this is the place to go.","For the price they offer I can't really complain about much. The location is in between west and east Nusa Penida so it's ideal for seeing both sides of the island if you intend to. The rooms are probably at 2-3 star hotel standard, but the staff is extremely helpful, nice, and resourceful. Overall a very comfortable stay.",You can get something closer to the harbour for the same price. Staff don‚Äôt even look at your face because they are just on the phone. Poor breakfast options.

The location of the hotel was simply breathtaking, as it offered a stunning view of the sea from my room. The hotel was well maintained, and the staff was extremely polite and courteous.

The swimming pool at the hotel was definitely a highlight of my stay. It was well-maintained, and I enjoyed taking a refreshing swim in the pool every day. The hotel also had a nice outdoor seating area near the pool, where I spent some relaxing moments while enjoying the sea breeze.

The complimentary breakfast at the hotel was a great touch. The food was fresh and delicious. The staffs over there was very friendly and helpful.

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing and comfortable stay near the beach.",Just go here . Book directly with Hotel and u might save money . Good safe place for children and women .,"The most enjoyable stay in my experience. The staff Peri and her sisters were very attentive, made happen all our requests, changed our room for the best view (even though all the rooms are in the perfect spot, right next to the beach). With no problem found for us motorbike with good price. Transport to the harbor arranged easily at early morning (6 am). Breakfast had various choice, ladies were asking every evening what do we want for the breakfast and at what time, then they bring the breakfast almost to your bed and sharp at the time. Incredible view to the sunrise during breakfast outside (picture attached). Room cleaning was everyday. Just facilities in the bathroom could be improved. We had an accident, have fall down from the bike, I got burn on my leg, Peri once she heard about that came to check on me and if need anything (it wasn't her working time?!). Amazingly friendly, positive, nice people. I wish I could stay more. Definitely recommend to my friends and will stay again whenever I am back. Thank you, Juan beach team! We miss you so much! Terimakasee!!!!!","Simply amazing!
The place is right at the beach and the rooms are super neat & comfy. There's a mart on the other side of the road. It's about 7kms from the roro ship port which makes it an easy 10-15mins bike ride.

AC works very well and the bathrooms are super neat and tidy.

Definitely recommend. It's a steal for the price

Ps. The pool view rooms also have the ocean view üòé"

The cleanliness of the restaurant was remarkable. From the spotless tables and polished cutlery to the pristine restrooms, every corner exuded cleanliness and hygiene. This aspect greatly contributed to my dining experience, as it enhanced my overall comfort and enjoyment.

As for the ambience, it was warm and inviting, with soft lighting . The background music added to the overall vibe without being too loud, allowing for pleasant conversations and a relaxed dining experience.

In conclusion, this restaurant stands out for its yummiest food, exceptional cleanliness, and inviting ambience, making it a top choice for anyone looking for a memorable dining experience in Nusa penida.","I have to say, food at SeaTara Kitchen Grill and Bar at Nusa Penida was absolutely delicious!
