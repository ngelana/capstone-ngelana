I spent a week here.
He wants to thank Leon very much. He was a very helpful man from the hotel staff - our caretaker. He was always at our disposal, very helpful. He was happy to organise fishing, massage, scooter rental for us.
Villa very spacious, pool VERY large.
Bedrooms have very good air conditioning.
Menu very varied. In front of the Villa beautiful beach, very large garden, amazing place.... A great house for relaxation.
Highly recommended!","Beautiful joglo, lovely air-conditioned bedroom with amazing outdoor shower! The garden was tropical with beautiful trees and flowers. You can hear the lapping waves from the spectacular warm huge pool, with infinity sides, that made you feel like you're in paradise. We were in the middle joglo, we never saw or heard our neighbours. The staff were welcoming and so kind and helpful. Everything we requested they fulfilled, no problem. Our chef Ilo, and Esa, we're absolutely lovely and her cooking was outstanding. We often asked for traditional Balinese dishes which weren't on the menu, it was all delicious, thank you so much. Ita was a brilliant masseuse, we had traditional and reflexology massages in the garden. We can't believe how strong she was and relieved us of all stresses and knots! Highly recommend, we had 3 each as it was so wonderful. A big thank you to Nono our guide for activities, who is so knowledgeable about the island. We went through the mangroves and as a low tide ended up walking as boat got stuck was really fun! We also went snorkeling to Deer Island reef. It was the best snorkel I have ever done, thousands of fish and saw 2 turtles, what a thrill! I have dived all over the world and this was by far the best! My husband's first snorkel and Nono made him feel safe. Sami our driver was so friendly, the long airport transfer was beautifully scenic, well worth it to escape the busy commercial city. Thank you all for making our honeymoon so special.","We stayed for a night and was very relaxing and wonderful. The Villas on a remote area just on almost at border of West Bali National Park where's beauty nature is surround and if you are lucky (as us) is easy for you to witness how's beautiful of Bali White Starling Bird on coconut tree while you enjoy your Breakfast.
Staffs are very friendly and helpfull, the Villa is clean and tidy...crytal clear pool water is so impressive and green lawn and coconut trees are so healthy and well maintain. All Villas facilities will make your staying is relaxing while you could enjoy the beach just infront of you.. Kichenette, LCD TV , mini library and some games are available in your Villa.
If you love a quite place to relax...away from hustle and bustle and love the nature, this place is an ideal 'beauty home' to stay.
We will definitely return with some friends who love to explore the beauty of silent and of course World Class Diving Site of Menjangan Island (25minutes drive).","A great place to relax right by the sea, the guardian Leon does his job perfectly and is always willing to help, I recommend this place","This property is remote.
Beware the grounds if you arrive late at villa 1 as there are many small holes on the lawns,where you can twist an ankle.
Do not walk under the coconut trees because of falling coconuts. Of course.
The pool has had the area of tiling near the steps    removed and the two tiles at the bottom are at an angle.
There is no ventilation in the bathroom and you cannot open any window. Blinds control not working of course.

Alcohol...Didnâ€™t you bring any. More fool you. When we asked for white wine with our first dinner, we were told that they had none,
but they had red and rose. Rose excellent. So I ordered 3 bottles for the rest of our stay...one arrived.
The closest town has only Bintang. Oh course it is extra $25 AUD to get it. Everything is a struggle here for guests.
When you arrive at any villa you expect basic provisions, perhaps juice and milk. None here. No capsules for coffee machine. No ordinary coffee, just local coffee. No jug to boil water, and of course no containers to even make our own ice from boiled water. There is a water machine that puts out passable hot water but not hot enough for tea or coffee. I asked for a jug or kettle but got an old coffee maker instead .now I boil water in a saucepan.

The daily disturbance by staff in your villa is amazing.
Staff walk in unannounced no bell , no knock, 2 to 5 boys will suddenly appear which in find a bit rude.. We tried to lock the gate but they take no notice.This happens at any time of the day. No knock, no bell. We eventually had to tell management that that was a problem.

You get pressure here. Even before breakfast we are told we have to book a day before. In the middle of our breakfast we were expected to order lunch and dinner.
Snorkeling in front of villa is possible but beware there is always a strong current. Fortunately we are strong swimmers so no worry for us.

And so it goes.
The property is beautiful but centipedes in the bed and under the mattress was the last straw."
