When we arrive, the hotel is dark, with no one at the front office. The room is old, no TV.

We booked the hotel for 4 nights, but end up checking oit after just one night.","I canceled my order. The hotel so spooky, it seem abandoned for long time ago. Just like entering horror hotel in the movie. The picture is fake. And the location is out of nowhere with hard accessibility. It seems trip advisor should check the  real condition of the resort. The owner unfriendly spoke on the phone. And none of guest at the resort. And l can‚Äôt get my refund back","Slice of paradise!  Not sure why the last reviewer said what he did but we loved this place.  I never would have thought I could have afforded to stay in a place like this.   Great rooms, view to die for, I could spend all day in the Infiniti pool.  The rooms are amazing we stayed in the family 2 bedroom.  So many insta worthy places around this hotel.  Yes there are some meal or drink items they don't have but seriously guys that's Bali.  If you want a clinical 5 star resort, stay in Nusa dual.   Just be aware getting here is part of the adventure.  Road in some places is a little dicey.  Family of 4 made it in a Suzuki splash ü§£.    So affordable, serene and awesome jungle noises at night.  #notspooky #jungleparadise",very interesting place. secluded and located on a hill that can be accessed by a bad road but once there its very cool. rooms are spacious and classic (with a roundish shape) with outside bathrooms and a very large grounds. not in the best shape overall but that adds to the ‚Äúcastle like‚Äù feel. no amenities around so probably will spend most time at the resort. food is fine. the views and the pool are the highlight.,"Just a perfect place to relax and rewind... The view is just hills, jungle and the lake. Days filled with birdsong, nights with star gazing, yes here you still have a perfect view of the stars at night. Road is not perfect but it's really not as bad as described, adds to the feeling of being in a remote rain forest location. Me and my family planned for two nights, ended up staying for a week. Already looking forward to our next visit were everyone made us feel like we had found a new home in the jungle. Thanks for an amazing time..."
