Great coffee and environment

You should totally stop by!","For youtube video search for ""Bali Bikepacking 2019 Day#2""

Stopped by this isolated and unassuming place run and own by a really nice gentleman.  If cycling, this place is not easy to reach but it is a fantastic place to stop if on the way to the Tamblingan (three lakes).  Some hills are really steep and some path reduced to fist-sized stones which makes is challenging to say the least. Highly recommended.","Away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas, Mulia Garden is an authentic, tranquil mountain getaway. Whether you are enjoying the panoramic views, the cool clean river waters, of just sitting and listening to the 3 x daily music and chanting drift across the valley from Pura (Temple) Siwa...Mulia Garden will refresh, re-energise and reinvigorate you!","The panorama of Mt.Batukaru are really good, the place is cozy and warm enough, and the price is quite cheap.. recommendedüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",Homestay & Camping Ground
