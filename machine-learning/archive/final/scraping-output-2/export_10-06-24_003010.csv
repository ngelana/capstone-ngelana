It was my girls first time riding and also our friends first time

We had welcome drink (I think it was lemon or lemongrass) which was delicious. Short briefing about our itinerary for the day, we then proceeded to wear the rubber boots they gave and then practice with the ATV a couple of times.

We visited lots of different places and had great pictures. Jungles, temple, waterfalls, mud, water, etc. It was an amazing day and had a fun time! There's also a simple lunch of rice with some herbs/spices and egg. Also, they have shower in the facility so you can clean the mud off after the activity (bring a change of clothes)

Halo ATV is very professional and friendly ! best people, best ATV track,!

Sukseme semeton üôèüèº","The only ATV adventure & e-bike ride that includes with documentation (pictures & video) without paying, usually I have to pay around 400k to get all my documentations. The most fun ATV adventure I ever had in Bali with friendly and helpful guide, clean bathrooms (they have shampoo, towel, plastic for wet clothes), they also have waterproof case for your phone. I took the package that includes with pick up & drop off, lunch & welcome drink. They also bring us hiking to hidden waterfall. Amazing experience, much much recommended!!","This is my first time doing ATV activity.

That was so amazing.
Great choice to spend time with family, friends and your group.

All staff so kind with warm service.
ATV track so challenging. We almost spend more than 2 hours including Go-Kart experience.

We also try Karangasem traditional food, call Nasi Saur with special tradition taste.

And Halo ATV have transport service to pick up around Denpasar City

Gonna be back again next time","It‚Äôs really fun things to do!
with the river track, the mud really makes us get us really dirty and wet but it‚Äôs so fun and the track through the village makes us see the lives of the people there!
Really recommend place to do atv when you‚Äôre here! ‚ú®‚ú®"
