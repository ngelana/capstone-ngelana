Concept cooking by a very sophisticated chef. Village style omakese for 120k two persons. By reservation only. We tried authentic Indonesian food that we never tasted before. Simple but creative and delicious. Highly recommend if you stay at Tepi Sawah !,"We were staying around the area and found this gem on Google maps. I‚Äôm glad we came despite the heavy rain as it was a great experience.

The food was delicious and the hosts were very friendly. Ketut showed us around his garden while we waited for the dishes. The crackers and wild fern were great but of course the star is their smoked meats. We cleaned our plates empty :)

You can DM them on Instagram to confirm a time slot before visiting! We‚Äôre the first foreigners to visit and I‚Äôm sure we won‚Äôt be the last. Thank you for the food and conversations ‚ò∫Ô∏è",Thank you Gede and your family for best sausage and smoked chicken. Bravo for vegetable and spices and all atmosphere in the jungle.
