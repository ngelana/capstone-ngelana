The staff at Flowerboy are always welcoming, and it‚Äôs no wonder that they are a buzzing meeting place where people love to hang out.
Fresh flowers are for sale daily, as well as a twice a week community run club which attracts hundreds of participants. The oat milk slushie is amazing and I love the home made almond milk. Love this for our local coffee spot!","Nice little place,
Suppose to be having a great view to lot of rice paddies but unfortunately there are 2 construction sites beside of it now.

They serve with smile and very friendly, care to explain about their menu.

Can't stay here too long, there is no toilet.

We tried long black and slushie, both were excellent üëç the slushie is very refreshing.

Not a suitable place for working. Since they do not provide electric outlet.

Well if you only need to relax a bit from anything, this place is definitely can be one option to add.","Good vibes, warm & welcoming people. But coffee is really not good at all :( I've visited on multiple occasions thinking that perhaps the previous time was a one time bad occasion, but it's just bitter and no flavour. Their almond milk apparently is homemade but tastes bad and too salty!","Went here on a nice sunny afternoon in July, when the wind was breezy and weather was perfect. Cozy little gem in Seseh, sits right next to rice paddies. Great view, great coffee, and warm hospitality. Tranquil atmosphere with not many people or vehicles passing by.

Unfortunately they dont have a toilet/restroom, so find a public toilet if you need to go. Also, they don‚Äôt provide plugs, so not really a place to stay hours with laptop on.

Overall, I personally love it, and would definitely visit again when around this area :)","Came back in Jul 23 and there‚Äôs a building right infront undergoing construction.
Mar 23 - A pretty cool outdoor only coffee shop with great coffee. Relax for a bit here while taking in the scenery of the rice paddy.
Price Cappuccino 35k & Burnt cheesecake 35k"

The staff makes you feel at home & is happy to chat with you if you feel like some company. Make sure you get in early as it gets quite busy during lunch time. You can find Arabic flavors mixed in the menu - double the deliciousness. I love the little outside area to watch the world pass by the rice fields.,"Delicious food, super tasty, plenty of choices, affordable, good portions, loads of vegan and vegetarian options. I simply love it! They deliver our fresh meals everyday, I‚Äôm really enjoying the variety of the meals and the convenience that brings to my days. More than recommend!","Great WiFi and cute spot for healthy food, coffee, Sony has such a great attitude! Loved making my own yogurt bowl",My new favourite spot to go each morning with hands down the best coffee in Seseh & Cemagi! Resident barista (Sonny) is one of the best on the island & the food is so good too. A great place to work from with airconditioning & ricefield views. üåû,"What a gem of a place! My experience here - from the moment I walked in, made my soul smile. Such incredibly friendly and helpful service and friendship. The food was out of this world (I had a vegan wrap - I'm not vegan, but it was absolutely delicious). When you're in the area - you have to pop in for something!"

The villa is private, and really clean and beautiful. They organise a cleaner each day but they don‚Äôt change over fresh towels just so you know (minor thing). Ikas was very helpful with any questions. It is a short walk down to a nice cafe and restaurants. Also very close to the beach. We would definitely come back!","This is such a beautiful villa! I stayed here with my boyfriend, such a romantic place and very convenient. Walkable to all the restaurants and the beach. Special thanks to Ikas for providing us with everything we needed during our stay! Couldn't find a more perfect villa, we will definitely come back!","Great location, brand new lofts, all well organized",,

10/10!  Absolutely love this new Seseh cafe! Fantastic yammy food & menu for different dietary requirements..Healthy, affordable, great quality..Very friendly & efficient staff‚Ä¶ Love design. Parking yes.","New favorite place around the area! Super friendly staff, open really early as well so it‚Äôs perfect for an early riser. Tried almost all their sandwiches and they all taste amazing! ‚ù§Ô∏è","I recently visited Neighbourhood Food, and it was an incredible experience from start to finish. The ambiance of the caf√© is perfect for both relaxation and socializing, with a beautifully decorated interior that captures the essence of Bali's charm. The staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive, ensuring that all my needs were met with a smile. I highly recommend ordering the ""Ham Breakfast Croissant"" and the ""C Plus"" fresh juice. The croissant was flaky and buttery, filled with savory ham and fresh vegetables. The ""C Plus"" juice was a refreshing blend of citrus fruits, perfectly complementing the meal. Both were incredibly delicious!

Whether you're looking for a place to work, relax, or catch up with friends, Neighbourhood Food is the perfect choice. It's a hidden gem that offers an exceptional dining experience. I can't wait to return!","i LOVE neighbourhood and am so glad they finally opened up a second location in seseh. their staff is the sweetest, the interior cool and original & the food is amazing!!! some of my favourite dishes: quinoa oat porridge, crumpets, omelette and the greens toastie :)","Cute corner spot in Seseh area ! Coffee by the neighbours at Flowerboy, awesome community vibes and plenty of menu options for dietries"
