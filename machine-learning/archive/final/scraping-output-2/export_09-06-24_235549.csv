The owner and staff are very friendly and helpful. The location is a bit outside of the city center, so someone can enjoy the beauty of nature. With the scooter it's only a short drive to the beach.","I stayed a room with a double bed and my own bathroom - everything was great! Sup sorted me a scooter so quickly (you definitely need to rent one if staying here as it makes life a lot easier to access things).
There is a little kitchen area you can use. Everyone who was staying here made the atmosphere lovely too, as they were very friendly.
The area is absolutely beautiful - rice paddy’s and local villages surrounding it all, and a quick drive to the beach and cafes.
Excellent for surfing but even if you don’t there’s still things to do - beach walks, hikes, the sea turtle conservation Centre.
Lovely chilled holiday. Thanks so much, Sup!","Loved staying here, little jungle oasis! Also if you're looking to start surfing then Sup is a great teacher, I ended up extending my stay and taking 8 lessons with him! Got to do a few sunrise surf's too!","Jungle house is a really nice place. Vibe is pretty nice and you get in contact easily with other people. The rooms are amazing, especially the single rooms, mine for example had a nice outdoor shower.  As it's not directly in the main areas a scooter would be recommended if you stay here. Also I got a surfing lesson with the owner, which was also pretty nice.","I have stayed in the Jungle House for over two weeks and had a really great time. I have meet very nice people there. Great Vibe!
The manager and his family are very nice.
The rooms are very good. The Garden and the homestay itself are beautiful! A great and quite place to relax during the day.
The Homestay lies in a quite and beautiful little village/Area.
I can absolutely recommend staying in Jungle House and would come back anytime!!!"
