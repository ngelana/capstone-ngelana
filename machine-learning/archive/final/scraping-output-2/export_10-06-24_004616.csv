They serve indonesian food and western food
Spacious table available outdoor or indoor
They have playground for kids
Meeting room
Spacious parking lot
Staff is friendly and helpfull
Just suggestion have some mosquito repellent for costumer that sit outside.

Food is tasty, huge portion
We order fish and chips, steam tofu, chicken steak, spaggeti bologness, chicken wings, overall food is ok.","Tourist trap,
I ordered Nasi Goreng thinking that its the safest choice but It wasn‚Äôt,
Its clearly wasn‚Äôt fresh and was reheated
The vegetables was carrots and pees and clearly from a frozen bag

And on top of it, we got so many mosquito bites and they didn‚Äôt had any misquote spray or candle to keep it away so we couldn‚Äôt even enjoy the view

We came at the late afternoon, I saw on the menu that they have Buffet at noon, maybe its better ,

But coming in the late afternoon is definitely not recommended","Will definitely visit it again one day. Great atmosphere, good food and service. Located not in a tourist area, which is a plus for us.","Good place for weekend, kids playground.",Great place tucked away just behind the city centre. Peaceful and relaxing with heaps of room and great area for the kids to play. Recommended if you need to cool down away from the hustle and bustle

Another good thing is this is 2 minutes away from The famous Kanto Waterfall and Babi Guling Pande Egi!","Nice place with nice people . Can't describe anything else,only Thumbs up. Very recommended place to stay if you all looking for a short or long term of stay.","stayed here for 6 months and it was incredibly comfortable!

the price was quite affordable compared to the complete facilities, including a water heater, a clothes drying area, and a balcony with amazing sunset view. there was also a laundry service available which made it convenient as you didn't have to do laundry outside. the house caretaker was also very friendly and responsive to any issues tenants faced.

the only downside: no sink for washing dishes, had to go downstairs to the common kitchen, which was a bit of a hassle since i lived on the 3rd floor.

overall, i was very happy!!! i really miss my room rn. this place is highly recommended for anyone looking to stay around Gianyar!",,
