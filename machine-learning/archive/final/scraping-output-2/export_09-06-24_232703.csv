They have plenty of comfortable indoor seating with AC and Wifi.
Great space for digital nomads.

Prices are on the higher side but the quality of food and drinks are very good.
I saw a nearby table with yummy looking Buddha-type bowls.

I had the Bali coffee and NY-style cheesecake.

I opted for a v60 and was pleasantly surprised to see a small selection of beans available. I chose the most funky sounding one and it was a decent cup of coffee, I'd give it a 7/10. I then had the shakshuka and it was really good, a big portion too! My partner got a smoothie bowl and enjoyed it, it was also a big portion! The people working were all super friendly but unfortunately no chat about the coffee, which I always look for. Also the toilet was closed which was inconvenient. Overall, a good coffee shop with skilled baristas. If you like your coffee made well,  it's worth checking out, one of the better places in Bali!","Sushi tacos were a 100/10 üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº best thing I‚Äôve eaten in AGES!!

Staff are very well trained. Pizzas, carpaccios were huge and delicious. Amazing, thin, crispy fired dough. Tax is included. Even though it is low season - the ambience is nice as they play low key lounge jazz. They even let us bring a bottle of wine as they do not have it on the menu just yet. We will be back :)","I highly recommend this restaurant in Melasti, closed to Amed, Bali. It is widely regarded as the best place in the area for pizza, Italian food, and a nice ambiance. The restaurant offers a cozy and charming atmosphere, perfect for a romantic dinner or a gathering with friends. The pizzas seemed to made with fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection in a traditional wood-fired oven, resulting in a deliciously crispy crust and flavorful toppings. Additionally, their menu features a wide variety of authentic Italian dishes, including pasta, risotto, and seafood, all prepared with great attention to detail. friendly and attentive staff further enhances the dining experience, this restaurant is a must-visit in Amed.","I was having high expectations for this restaurant after reading the reviews. I ordered the gnocchi, and it's really tasteless. They gave me a portion of parmesan cheese and i and put some more salt and pepper, but it wasn't really helped.
My partner was ordering pizza. It took a very long time for the pizza to come. i almost finished my dish for the pizza come out. The taste was okay. Overall, the ambiance was nice and fancy, but they should improve their food tastes and service.","There are two Italian styled restaurants in the Amed area providing a similar experience and menu. This is one of them and compared to the other it utterly fails. Having eaten at both this week, and coming off the great food of the northern restaurant, I had high hopes.  However, La Bottega did not do well.  All the food we had lacked flavour.  The pasta carbonara was very bland and needed a good deal of salt and pepper applied at table (I haven't salted a prepared dish in years!). The noodles were not homemade as purported and as they are at the competition. The capricciosa pizza was also not very flavourful (lack of seasoning), given the ingredients, and it was soggy to raw from the middle of the slices to the center. The wedges we had were unique in their heavy bread crumb/fish stick style coating, but not tasty as the potatoes tasted like processed frozen rather than whole fresh potatoes. The only pleasant items were the fresh pineapple juice and side salad. But they are not enough to go for given the two excellent juice bar restaurants just down the street. The service was pleasant but a bit erratic and the strident bell ringing from the kitchen counter felt like being in a truck stop diner rather than a nice restaurant. And for the quality and taste the value was not there....we paid 400+k for the items mentioned plus 1 large Bali Hai beer...that's 30+$ which is very expensive for Bali...compared to a bit less for an EXCELLENT meal at Gusto in north Amed.  I am sad to say that cannot recommend this restaurant on any level.","It‚Äôs strange, if you work until 10 pm, then why instead of music I only hear songs and screams from the kitchen and I constantly had to call the waiters 3-5 times until you start screaming. the food is not worthy of attention. The pizzas are dry, the eggplants are not tasty, the fish burger is terrible, the fish is very dry. no wine. It was late and nothing was working anymore, there was no choice. but the food I ate was not very tasty only the beef was edible. prices are cheap. but why waste food?"

We also went diving a couple of times using Franck who was great from start to finish very knowledgeable, very good eye in the water spotting turtles and an array of other marine life. Also the quality of the gear they have vs other locations we have used on the island is second to none which always makes me feel extra safe when hiring from resorts.","Lovely place to satay, the ""huts"" are spacious and well equipped, the pool is lovely and it is placed almost at the beach.

It looks like there‚Äôs 6 rooms to stay in. We were in one at the far left end of the grass area and it was rough. Mosquitoes everywhere. Room was super dark cause one of the overhead lights was broken and the nightstand lamp didn‚Äôt have an adapter to the wall. It‚Äôs a wooden shack and there were gaps in the wall. AC did not work well due to the gaps. If we hadn‚Äôt arrived late, we would have moved that night and not stayed. There were insects inside and everywhere. Mosquito netting is a must. It was pretty dirty. Dead bugs and dirt. Bedding smelled like old sweat, like it had been left damp for too long. At 4am, sounded like there was rodents or a pest chewing on something in the roof.

Service: they gave you a welcome drink but didn‚Äôt come by to clear it until the next day.
I will give them credit that they didn‚Äôt charge extra for me checking out early.

I will say, we might have just gotten the worst room. Some of the other building looked like they had solid walls and might not have been a problem.

You have to walk down a muddy path to get to this place. it is not beachfront despite what photos might say.","I stayed 6 nights at Soka. The staff is friendly. We rented a scooter but it could reach only 30 km/hr with two people on it so we asked for another one. The second one was slightly better, not very good but enough to drive around in Amed. The worst thing was that the roof has holes and one night it rained directly onto the bed and onto my face at 4 am. There are two very different types of rooms (one with a glass door and curtains and the other one completely made of wood) but this is not made clear at all on the booking websites.","I got a nice little bungalow, so you are not sharing a wall with others. The room was a great size with a mosquito net covering the bed to keep those pests away while you sleep.

As it is a rustic bungalow, there are gaps in the wall, so the mosquito net was quite necessary. Also, it is an outside bathroom, so you must be careful when you use it at night, for showers or other, because of possible insect bites.

The location is a bit hidden, so finding it could be tricky but not a problem after you know where it is. You can walk along the beach to get to the main street part of town to do shopping or for meals, instead of via the road, which requires a big loop.

In general,  I enjoyed my stay here and the staff member was very helpful.","We stayed one week at the white Bungalow and it was a very pleasant stay. It was very clean and the stuff very friendly and helpful. The location is very quiet and the garden view is beautiful. We loved the bathroom, which is located outside, but can be accessed from inside of the Bungalow. It is a nice feeling to have a hot shower in the evening outside. The Bungalow was cleaned every day and we had no problems with insects inside of the Bungalow.

Only ""downside"": it is a long way to walk to the next restaurant. So we would recommend to rent a scooter.

We definitely recommend this place. :)","Thought this was on the beach, but it's facing an alley, still close to the beach.

Room had moldy pillows, mold on walls. I wouldn't stay there so rebooked elsewhere.

Service guys were communicative on whatsapp and let me cancel the booking."

We had the big breakfast and avocado egg and large Cappuccino with extra shots that we can totally recommend. The juices were fresh and tasty. We will come again,"Cute coffee shop with a view of the lush fields and mountains. The food was fine and highly affordable; however, some dishes could be improved. The falafel burger was a bit dry without much sauce. The wedge potatoes, though, are delicious. The peanut sauce of the Gado-Gado was too liquidy and watery, which lessened the flavors of the whole dish. Otherwise, we liked everything else, notably the vegetables and tofu served with the rice bowl and fried egg.","Amazing place to eat And drink. Super friendly staff and delicious food.

Although we made reservations via Booking_com 4 days prior to our arrival, when we got to Yogika, staff told us that they are overbooked, and will arrange a room somewhere across the street, and we need to wait 1 hour.
While waiting, we decided to order lunch with them, and as a result they mixed our order with some other guest's, and we got different food. No apology, just here you go, now eat!
The staff was super slow, very unfriendly, they even started to raise their voice on us. Each interaction with them was very tensed and unpleasant.
Yogika is not worthy your nerves, time and money!","Great place! Super relaxing. Sauna every few days (try crystal menthol when you're there). There's space to do yoga, kick a bag, a pullup bar.

Also breakfast is included each morning, and you can‚Äôt beat the view! Would 100% stay here again!","My husband and I have stayed here two years in a row now and would love to come back someday. Our stay this time was 3 weeks. Komang and family are so kind, welcoming, and accommodating. The room is very comfortable and clean. The view of Mount Agung is stunning. They provide a big water jug in the room which is so convenient and they provide laundry service as well for an extra price. There is complimentary breakfast every morning and they can set up various tours such as a sunset boat ride (which was amazing).

I would definitely recommend staying here on your trip to Amed. Many good restaurants are in walking distance including One Way Espresso, Good Stuff Amed, and more. There‚Äôs also a gym in walking distance and a good spa - Island Girls Bali. The location is great!

Thank you for 2 wonderful stays üôèüèº","I had a lovely stay here for 5days. The room is clean, tidy and location is great with a stunning view of the Mount Agung.
Komang and family provides a warm and friendly hospitality throughout my stay; always looking after my needs.

Great place to stay to be away from the town etc. Waking up to the greens and voice of the rooster :))","Stay here with my Wife, The view just wonderful, the host is very helpful and warm. Such a wonderful place to stay in Amed. Thank you Bli ! What a great experience"

We immediately felt welcomed by Juliani and her husband. We rented a scooter from them at a very competitive price so that we could get around town easily (the location of the property is excellent but to cut down on walking time it‚Äôs much easier to get around on scooter). And they helped us organize getting to Padang Bai port and the ferry to Gili Air, which made our lives so much easier.

The rooms are spacious and very clean. From wherever your room is you have a spectacular view of Mt Agung or of the fields and mountains. It‚Äôs an incredibly peaceful place to wake up. And the included breakfast at Melon Cafe is the perfect way to start the day.

We had a fantastic time at Tanaya and would wholeheartedly recommend it for anyone staying in Amed.","One of our best accommodation in Bali!!
The view from the rooftop is amazing with beautiful sunset every evening! The rooms have everything you need in a very good price! You can rent a scooter here and have a lot of transportation help!
The food is great and juliani and Nyoman the owners are the best persons we met!!Amazing view from the rooftop every morning/evening. Rooms were great and had everything you needed, water pressure was always fine with hot water. You can rent a scooter for a great price as well!
Juliani and Nyoman, the owners, were really friendly and welcoming. Highly recommended!!",Very nice and homely. Walkable to town and the beach. Friendly and helpful staff and boss. Quiet rooms looking at either Agung or the rice fields.,"This place is so nice! I came late in the evening when I couldn‚Äôt check in anywhere else as I haven‚Äôt made any reservation. I booked only for one night at the beginning, and I was tempted to go check some other places at first, however when I started to meet the family that runs this homestay I decided to extend my stay here without hesitation. The owner gave me a very fair price for the room, they change my bed sheets every day, the wifi works well, the place is clean, and more importantly, the people who runs the business is very nice and friendly, even taking care of me while I was struggling with stomach pain. The location is great, close to town and nice cafe places and restaurants. The view of Mount Agung in the morning from the rooftop is breathtaking. And the breakfast is yummy. They also do laundry in situ. The mattress is comfy, the room is big, and it comes with a fan and strong aircon. Big thanks to Juliani and her family!","It was a wonderful stay ! We stayed 3 nights during to get our open water certificate and everything was just perfect, I highly recommend it and will go back there if we come back to Amed !
Thanks for everything !!"

Very quiet, beautiful territory & rooms. I tried all of them.
I spent a few months and had a very warm communication with owner and staff.
Always clean. Ready to help with anything (I needed to repair the car, they called mechanic).
The area is perfect, close to most tasty cafe's, coffeeshops, nice to walk around and enjoy the nature.
Very grateful for the time here ü´∂","Amazing place with a very lovely host. The rooms are very spacious, with daily cleaning and breakfast included. Furthermore the host is a wonderful human being, operating this home stay to help expand her goal of opening a school for disabled children and a dog shelter.","I stayed here for 3 days on my way from the Gili Islands to Bali airport. It is an excellent place to stay, especially if you are looking for a place long term.

I only saw one room - my own obviously - so can't speak for all of them, but it was spacious, clean, with a comfortable bed, a ceiling fan and an AC.

I wasn't expecting it but there was also a fully kitted out kitchen with a stove, fridge, rice cooker and hot/cold water dispenser. This area also had its own ceiling fan.

The bathroom was also spacious and the shower worked well with hot water. Towels were provided.

The owner, Esther, was very helpful in cooking her own recipes for breakfast (included in the room price) and dinner. She also took me on various tours and dropped me in Denpasar for my flight. Thank you! She has several dogs which are friendly enough, and the pool area also has a koi pond which small children would probably find fun.

I would highly recommend Feel Home Villa!","After spending 6 months here living with my girlfriend.
Can safely say this felt like our home and couldn't recommend it highly enough to anyone.
The owner Esther and her staff have become friends and people that will remember forever.","One and the only in amed, beautiful villa complete with kitchen pool and garden, I wash brink my guest come to this villa, and when I see for the first time I just fall in love with this place feel like home üòçüòçüòçüòç, and I take my wife for short vacation for 5 days and feel like I won't go back to my own house as we are feel home here.

Really nice cabins, very kind staff, and location is prime and right on the beach.

What my days looked like: I would wake up with the view of the ocean from my bed, go for sunrise beach walks, swim in the warm ocean in front the cabins, eat amazing breakfast that Komang made me every morning, at night amazing stargazing, and great vibes!

It was exactly what my soul needed, left feeling refreshed  ü§ç and grateful that this slice of paradise exists","Would come back without hesitation! Owner and staff are really nice and I wished I could have stayed longer. Yes, you'll hear dogs and roosters and potentially boats but it's a beach cabin so it's to be expected.  Some restaurants in proximity but probably good to drive a scooter to get everywhere.","One of the best accommodations I‚Äôve ever stayed at. Don‚Äôt mind the previous comments about loudness of neighbours. All you hear is the sound of the waves and chicken in the morning, just peaceful and spectacular. The bungalow is right on the beach, with its own terrace, hammock, and sunbeds. The room is simple but well-decorated, the bed is facing out the door so if you leave the doors opened you will be waking up with the beauriful sunrise of Amed. Outdoor shower with all you need. The staff is lovely and kind, they will help you organize everything you need such as transfer, bike rental, and tours. Don‚Äôt worry about no AC because it‚Äôs so breezy you won‚Äôt even need a fan. What can I say, such hidden gem to find this place.","Perfectly private and quiet,  clean and natural.  You can rent for a night, a month, or a year. Feels like your own house. I chose the natural with fan not aircon, but some have aircon too. The cleaning staff are so lovely and you watch the fishermen in the morning too.  The ocean is only meters away, the sounds of the ocean are a lovely way to relax. There is a great cafe nearby and laundry as well.","The Neighbours were playing super loud music for 8 hours straight signing karaoke literally a few meters from our cabin. Theres construction on site in the morning. If you are looking for noise and discomfort, this is the right place. Otherwise get one of the thousand others beach accomodation."

The rooftop also offers cheap food and drinks, making it a perfect spot to relax without breaking the bank. They even have bean bags to chill on, which adds to the laid-back atmosphere.

The hostel itself is clean and comfortable, providing everything we needed for a great stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, making us feel right at home. I highly recommend Stopp Inn Hostel to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable stay near the beach. Can't wait to come back!",Recommended place to stay and they also have a restaurant n bar in the rooftop. Really good ambiance and cozy with a wide mountains view. Only 5mins to Amed Beach!

I loved the private big table and terrace with views of Mount Agung and kilometres of farmland. Exceptionally good wifi, too. Would def stay here again.","I spent 10 days residing at the Agung Inn and I highly recommend it. The accomodation is set in a tranquil very scenic part of Amed. It is less than 5 minutes by scooter to the centre of Amed. The owners take a lot of care to keep the rooms and surrounding gardens clean and I‚Äôm immaculate condition. They are also very responsive to any enquires, friendly and helpful throughout the stay.","I've stayed in a few places in Bali and Agung Inn was by far my favorite!
It's set amongst rice fields with a stunning view of Mount Agung in the front and green hills to the left.
It's a little bit away from the road so it's not too noisy. Also away from the center of Amed but within walking distance to restaurants and the beach.
The room is beautifully minimally decorated and has lots of light and it was clean!
The WiFi was great, too.

The best part of my stay were the hosts! Putu and Ketut went out of their way to not only help with anything I needed, but also to make me feel welcome.

I hope to come back one day and I would 100% recommend Agung Inn to anyone visiting Amed.","We cannot recommend this accommodation enough! The room was perfectly clean and the view is all you can wish for. Putu and Ketut did their best to make our stay as comfortable as possible - they took care of everything we needed: scooter rental, laundry, boat tickets, transport to the port.

The room is great, AC and WiFi all works perfectly. Thoughtful details in the room make it homely :)","Upon our arrival we received a cool refreshing welcome drink. There are 3 clean and comfortable bungalows with a nice little garden in front. The staff was friendly and available. In case they are not around you can simply call them with a provided phone. We had banana pancake both mornings and enjoyed them with a juice and tea/coffee. Juices are very sweet so order with less or no sugar if you don't like too much of it.
The beach is just a short walk away. Ac and wifi working well. Cosy veranda.","Stayed here for 2 nights and the service was the best we have had so far. Awesome breakfast and very clean, tidy rooms.
