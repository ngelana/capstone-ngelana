ChIJMakBGdYi0i0RKraUV83VXuA,Cozy Wayan Sueta Bed & Breakfast,-8.479929,115.23701290000001,"Jl. Tunjung, Ketogan, Taman, Abiansemal, Badung Regency, Bali 80352, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=16167594790221035050,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3929-762,guest_house,"guest_house, bed_and_breakfast, hiking_area, private_guest_room, park, travel_agency, lodging, restaurant, food",5,31,,Amazing place for peace and quiet and a lot of lush greenery. You will need a motorbike or Grab to go to Ubud center but it's a good place to be away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy areas! The food prepared by Putu is really good so you don't really need to go out if you want to just stay in. Wayan is a wonderful host who is always ready to lend a helping hand. This place is really close to the original Bali Swing so that's something to include in your itinerary.,"The best stay in Bali so far! We really enjoyed our time here and wish to come back one day.
Wayan and the whole family are so lovely, helpful, open and respectful.
You feel like home immediately there!
If you want to be on your own it‚Äôs no problem and the guesthouse is very private and hidden behind many plants, but I recommend to spend some time with the family as they are super friendly people and Wayan is the best guide you can find! He has been working as a guide basically his whole life and has the best information, advice for trips and your journey and is happy to share it and help you organise your next steps. He shared so much insights and we learned a lot through him - thank you very much!
Also if you want some guided tour Wayan is your man, as he has so much knowledge and pride about Bali.

Food:
Putu (his sister in law) prepared us the most delicious food not only for breakfast (it‚Äôs included) but also for lunch or dinner. It was really big portions but we always ate everything as the taste was just so good!
So if you come here, make sure to eat at least once (or all your meals!) there.

Location:
The guesthouse is in the garden from the family. You can see the most amazing plants there, it is like a botanical garden, just so beautifully arranged. The guesthouse has a veranda where you can sit, the room is spacious and has both air conditioning and a ventilator. The bathroom has kind of an outdoor shower which is also super nice, a fridge is available and everything was super clean.
You can walk a view minutes from the guesthouse and find yourself in the middle of rice fields and beautiful nature.

You can spend your time there if Ubud is a bit too crowded and make day trips to Ubud or go to the rice terraces, lake temple, some waterfalls, hot springs  - there is plenty to see and do and Wayan will help you plan the trip.

You can also rent a scooter, which was in a great condition and the brakes and motor worked really well.

We just had the best time here, so if you read this don‚Äôt hesitate and book your accommodation here - you won‚Äôt regret it!

Wayan, Putu and the rest of the family: It was lovely staying with you and we hope to see you again!","Best stay ever! I stayed with Wayan & his family in his beautiful balinese home for 2 weeks. It comes with a breakfast as well! I took the 1st villa and the interior is absolutely amazing. A well-conditioned aircon, a bed with a mosquito nets attached to it & of course, not forgetting the most pristine outdoor bathroom I‚Äôve ever seen! Taking a shower has never been this peaceful and therapeutic & you can be ‚Äúone‚Äù with nature - showering while enjoying the sun rays on your skin and the fresh air. One of the best airbnb homestays I‚Äôve ever stayed at! Thank you wayan and family for making me feel like a part of your balinese family and also making sure I feel like home ü§çü§çü§çü§çü§çüôèüèº
Oh and they have cute puppies and kittens that I absolutely adore!!!!","Had the pleasure of staying Here with Wayan and his family for a month! Stayed in 2 of the different houses on the property and both were absolutely beautiful! They really make you feel like you're at home and you're part of the family, but you're also still secluded and you get your privacy. If you want a feel for what it's like to live in Bali, this is the place!! One of their dogs, Brown, is also the sweetest little man ever! I will definitely be back!","Beautiful and safe place!
Ayu, Wayan and their whole family made us very comfortable. Wayan tried his level best to take us to our favorite places in Bali. He also made it sure that we would have lunch with the best view and ambience. Every restaurant he took us was different and better than previous.
Wayan, our Bali trip wouldn't have been this great without you.
Thanks for homely environment. I have already started recommending you to my contacts.
You are wonderful family!"
