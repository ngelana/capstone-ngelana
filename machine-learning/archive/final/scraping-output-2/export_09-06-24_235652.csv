TICKET : 25K/Person

On the way was nice landscape with beautiful view
Road are a bit rough Al along the village there.

The pool Hot spring was dirty I would say.
At the bottom the pool can feel so many crumble of something hard.
Toilet not clean
The floor also can say that they don't clean it. Be careful slippery.

This place need to be clean!!

It has 3 pool there but only 1 pool that we can use.
1 pool was empty & the other 1 was with old dirty water.

The view was surrounded by rice fields and just nature.
Met the American guy that own the Green house just across of the street of the Hot spring gate.","We arrived around 5pm it took us some time to get there from Ubud, owner was so nice! We asked for two coconuts, they charged us 20k for two and went with us to the pool with knife and long pole to cut it from the coconut tree ðŸ˜† which was next to the pool. This is sulphur water and only one pool was available, the other one was empty. Water is about 37-38 degrees. This place has big potential but needs to improve. Ticket is 25k per person. I hope owner can increase standard and clean changing room and toilet, we stayed there for two hours and we had pool just to ourselves. Overall great experience!","Great hot spring and amazing scenery of rice field and nature. Feels like a paradise still untouched and not overdeveloped which is amazing if you're into that kind of thing. Very narrow road so some drivers might not want to risk the drive, definitely worth checking out.","place is very quiet even on week end not so many people. very peaceful place. was camping for 3 nights at this amazing place. dud not expect that place is so beautiful. with amazing view to mountain and rice fields. family is so nice. they host my like family member. hot spring is very nice. from small streams coming hot water. you can sit watch river and be at same time under hit water stream. i go after to Jatiluwih rice terrace and decided to come back and stay few more days.
