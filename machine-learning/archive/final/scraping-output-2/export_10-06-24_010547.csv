It is not my thing, but can't deny that it has its crowds and it is super busy and vibrant. There are a lot of options on where to sit, and different cuisines, definitely has its own charm!
I personally prefer calmer places, there is so much traffic to reach the place and expect to wait a lot when you want to get out of the place. You'll get to see the crazy party side of the island.
Staff were very friendly and accommodating.","The club is one of its kind, great party place especially if you are travelling with your friends. The night vibe is too good. The food though could have been better, but the vibe and ambience compensates for that.. so can‚Äôt complain :) overall, must visit place if you are in Bali.","The service for when you don‚Äôt drink was awful. As soon as I ordered something that wasn‚Äôt alcohol it took ages. It seemed like they forgot the order. They didn‚Äôt serve mocktails at two of the bars. Only option was soda or a coke.

Besides that the venue is amazing. Beautiful location. Good music.","This place is awesome and my favorite beach club if you‚Äôre looking for a very up beat and party vibe. Lots of table options. Multiple pools (one kid friendly, one not kid friendly and one vip). Great sunset views. You can access the beach. Great music and the party goes into the night where it is basically an outside nightclub. So much fun!","Beautiful beach club looking out across the ocean. I arrived for the sunset and the party was definitely already underway.

There was live music, DJ's and performances happening across the venue.

I didn't have a booking, but if you'd like a spot to sit down and relax, then I recommend booking a bed/lounger and making the day of it.

The prices of drinks are definitely more on the expensive side, however the food prices seemed reasonable and were of great quality. - you could even order sushi or an Indian curry! So lots of options to suit everyone.

The staffing was impressive. There was always someone on hand to support and the cleaning of the areas and walkways were taken seriously.

There are a few different bars across the venue, although I found it difficult to order a drink and was told that some don't accept cash.

Overall, I enjoyed having a boogie here."

We got upgraded to a day bed which was fab!
Also, it's very reasonably priced!","Honestly I loved everything about this place. We had a day bed on the pool and the view was breathtaking, I‚Äôve never seen a more beautiful sunset. The food, drinks and hookah were great. We drank, ate and smoke for about 5 hours and still came under 2 million so great prices. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be coming back.

Loved the espresso martini and sushi rolls. Amazing vibes","A really cool nightclub. Very modern interior. The sound was pretty monotonous, the later the evening, the better the DJ. The prices are at the upper limit for Bali. What I think is cool is that you can order a strong or weak Long Island ice tea for the same price.

It isn't as relaxing as other beach clubs. Admittedly, we were here during the day and it wasn't busy. It's probably more fun in the evenings.

I will likely come back (mainly for the great drinks) but not a must-do in my opinion.","The service here was exceptional. We would love to especially thank the gorgeous Lena who really took care of us. Her smile and attentiveness was just astounding.
The venue can do with a fresh coat of paint though.
If you want to experience a chilled vibe, come early afternoon as the party crowd arrives for happy hour just before sunset.","First timer here, vibes is great with the live dj performance. I ordered cocktails for happy hour, best deal it was. For dinner i got chicken parmigiana, very tasty."

The venue is huge with plenty of seating and food and beverage service is spot on. The pool itself is so awesome and the music suits the venue.

Breakfast menu is delicious, I Love the pancake.

Their location is not actually a direct issue. It is just Canggu area still only have a 2-lane fit for 2 way car lane. Often caught in traffic. But for the hotel itself, perfect.","My family and I had the pleasure of staying in a family room at Lv8 Resort Hotel.

I have to say that this was one of the best Resorts we have stayed in.

From the moment we arrived we were greeted by such warm and welcoming staff. Our whole family got complimentary ice blocks on arrival along with a cute bucket with sand toys for each of the kids (15 months and 4yrs).

Our family room was available for early check-in which was such a bonus.
The Family Room was animal themed, had a teepee setup with books and games. My 4 year old was completely in love with the bunks, which had built in safety rails on the top allowing her to sleep on the top bunk.

Our room was large and the bathroom was very spacious with a full sized bath. The hotel is a little dated but honestly that didn't take away from our experience at all.

The complimentary breakfast buffet was good but modest however the fact that included we could order off a menu to have a fresh breakfast and espresso coffee was a fantastic touch.

The hotel offers a free shuttle service to local places. We used it twice during our stay to Finns Rec Club and Mades Warung.

My 4 year old did not want to leave (none of us did lol) and she has already asked to go back there again. We were so happy with our experience there and can't wait to return again one day.

Thank you to the staff for making it such an enjoyable stay, you are amazing!","We had a great time staying here. Very helpful staff especially Ms. Fitri! Very welcoming and professional. I love her! Also Mr. Ardi. We arrived early at the hotel due to our very early flight and though standard check in was 3pm, they found a way and allowed us for early check in. We appreciate this so much. Our room is 2BR with pool. While some parts needs a little fix like the mirror there were some dark spots already, I could say that the room is well maintained. I love that its super spacious. They also have amazing beach club and cafe that serves free breakfast. And their food was superb! Would definitely come back here. Hopefully the beach front would do some clean up as we see some rubbish by the shore. Hope the hotel would help to do maintenance to that part also.","My family liked this place as their staycation place for 1 week here.
good hotel, friendly service, the hotel has a beach club with a beautiful sunset and delicious food. It's just that the road to the hotel in Canggu is sometimes jammedü§ï and it's better to use a motorbike than a car but overall it's good for the hotel. it's nice to spend time at the beach club and the rooms are big and comfortable","Our room is very spacious.

It's located between Seminyak and Canggu, so it's easy to go anywhere.
Finns and Atlas are right in front.
If you have a hotel key, you can enter Atlas for free.
There is a convenience store right in front and many good restaurants nearby.

Hotel breakfast and coffee from coffee shops are not recommended.  Indonesia is a good coffee producer, but people here don't seem to know the taste of good coffee.
I don‚Äôt recommend rooms with a terrace on the side of the road because they are noisy.
The room is clean and good value for money, but there is no hand shower and only a rain shower, which is inconvenient.
This is a case where a welcome coupon is given, but it seems like it was given for a good purpose, but you get criticized even after giving it.

Only 4 stars because the toilets could really need a renovation. Also there is some inflexibility for special requests of the menu, it was not possible to order a scoop of ice cream separately (although ice cream comes with other desserts like cake etc.).","Atmosphere was almost perfect, except that smoking & vaping seems to be allowed everywhere, which really ruins it unless you're into that smell.

The service started off fantastic, but somehow became terrible later on. Seemingly nothing could get the attention of the staff. After going to the bar to place orders, they didn't arrive. After reminding them about a tiramisu order about 30 min later, they brought it, but without spoons. Drinks orders also required reminding when they didn't arrive after about 30 min.

Drinks seemed to be better than the food.

This place is frustratingly close to being amazing, but some crucial parts of it let it down.","We had a day at the beach club.

At the first sight of the place you can easily see that this beach club isn‚Äôt at all in the same condition as for example Finn‚Äôs or Atlas. The whole place needs a total renovation! The roof is starting to fall of, the building and the interior is dirty and old.

The bathrooms are really old and disgusting and you couldn‚Äôt lock the door to one of the two bathrooms at the ladies. Also it smelled SO bad at the ladies room and when I threw my paper towel in the bin there were poop in the bin!! So incredibly disgusting!!

The staff was all very nice and friendly but they seemed a bit confused sometimes and the communication between them could be better.

They serve big dishes and it tasted okay.

The pool is nice and clean.

The feeling is that this place is trying to look nice and luxurious but it is definitely not.

If you want to go to a beach club that is MUCH better and in the same price category you should definitely go to Atlas instead. BIG difference!",We came here instead of other popular beach clubs like Finns and The Atlas cause it‚Äôs more chilling and quiet here. Beautiful setting on the beach. Single beds are 250k and bean bags are 300k per pax. Food and drinks are average but the view is awesome.,"We go to this place often because the pool is great with kids especially, but the circumstances are getting worse and worse, today was the second time reaching a shocking level. A few months ago like almost every time they managed to mess up every single order, but on top of that the water in the pool was green and in the changing room out of 3 toilets 2 were literally covered in sh*r and blood and only 1 shower was working, that wasn‚Äôt only dirty, but there was a used tampon in it too‚Ä¶ I ended up going to the gm of the hotel to complain, who did not care and did not even offer anything to make up for the horrible and disgusting experience‚Ä¶ I did not write a review but today it was again shocking on many levels, so today I decided to put that also in the review. The pool today was in a state, that I have never seen anywhere, sooo disgusting that it‚Äôs outrageous‚Ä¶ not only totally green (you couldn‚Äôt even see your feet in the water) but someone swimming on top of it in patches and around the cabanas so slimy that the stairs were dangerously slippery already, so I think it hasn‚Äôt been cleaned for weeks!!!
The food in general is quite bad, there are a few edible things on the menu, but they changed it and the only thing that actually was great, the Vietnamese chicken salad they removed and refused to make it‚Ä¶ I tried to order summer roles instead without onions because I‚Äôm allergic‚Ä¶ they made it but with peanut sauce with onions and they haven‚Äôt even told me before‚Ä¶ when I told them that I can‚Äôt eat it, they offered thousand island sauce instead‚Ä¶ obviously I sent it back‚Ä¶ and lost my appetite‚Ä¶ but they still tried to make me pay for the minimum consumption for the sunbeds after this‚Ä¶ outrageous and shocking really‚Ä¶."

When we arrived around 4 p.m. looking for a place to have an early diner,  we chose to sit in one of the lounge sofas facing the ocean. We asked a waitress if it's ok to sit there(a lot of tables were empty). She said there is a minimum charge of 250k per person. I replied: ""No problem."" Thinking this is normal in Canggu.  But then, after a while, we noticed that she didn't mention this to other guests. We felt insulted.

The moijtos we ordered tasted like water, and there was no flavor at all. We ordered one appetitizer to try the calamari, which was tasty.  But we decided to leave as we do not want to waste our money at a place that doesn't deserve it.","Wow, what a place, what food, great DJ. We went on a Saturday afternoon and had grilled sardines, octopus and clams. Felt like I was on a Portuguese beach, not in Canggu. The owner is really attentive and really cares about his customers and the waiters were all lovely. Make sure you go to Caravan.","Caravan is a really nice place to spend the day at the beach.

The food and drinks were great - we got tacos and cheese platter first - honestly tacos were great but cheese board was very small for the price (you can see its quite empty).

Amazing food and cocktails","Absolutely positively earned the reputation for the ""best beach club in Bali."" üôåüôè Thank so much for an unforgettable night!

Our party arrived without reservations and even with the party jumping right at sunset, we had plenty of space in the VIP lounge.

Not sure if the lounge was exclusive and they waived admission for us or if the description VIP is more just a name, but it proved to be the most chill spot at Finns and overlooked the entire club right at sunset.

It was an excellent place to start our fun and the drinks were amazing! Whiskey sour was 10/10, the sunset cocktail was 10/10, AND they came around passing out Limoncello complimentary for those who wanted it!

After we finished our first few drinks we got the dance party and rocked out with the live DJ and singer performing all kinds of hits pushing the vibe into the next level.

When we got tired from dancing, we went to Monsoon for food and few drinks, and found out that there were ALSO GOGO dancers on the bar?!? Passing out sparklers to everyone every half hour or so?!?

Minds were blown, then we ordered food. You can order from any restaurant on the premises from a single menu. We had paneer Tikka masala, sushi, and a salad with duck spring rolls as appetizers and I don't think there's a way to go wrong. That place does everything to highest possible standard.

The food was fantastic, the staff was 10/10 service and atmosphere were almost undescribable. I think they cleaned the bathroom after every single use!?!

You simply have to experience it to believe it. This visit was absolutely the highlight of our stay in Canggu."

We stayed in a room that had a partial sea view towards the back of the hotel but could still hear the sea which was lush. Breakfast in the morning in the garden at the front overlooking the sea was a great setting. You are between Finns and another club so you can hear music in the afternoon and into the evening, but we enjoyed having some background beats and didn't find it offensive at all. We were sad to leave as it was a beautiful little hotel.","Great location if all you wanna do is go to Finn‚Äôs
It‚Äôs basically in the heart of the most happening spot in Beruwa. I‚Äôd stay here again for sure it‚Äôs super chill, but there‚Äôs music all night long - thankfully the room is insulated enough so you can‚Äôt hear much.",We enjoyed this hotel. The beach out the front was good for our teens to surf and lovely staff. Spent lots of time chilling out on the chairs by the pool. Yes Finns is next door but it didn't bother us that much.,"Beautiful beach side hotel with great swimming and surfing. One Friday night there was a disco blasting out the tunes until 2PM, so yeah, it can be a bit loud at times!","Good location by the beach, breakfast was good but rooms are a bit small and need some maintenance, but in general was good experience"

The breakfast was unbelievable and you can choose up to 4 things and 2 drinks plus a buffet, it's impossible to eat it all. Rooms were beautiful and the pools are a nice place to chill. It is a little loud from Finns beach club over the road which stops at midnight, but if you know it's there it's not a problem at all, or sleep with ear plugs. Bathroom was lovely too. Staff super friendly. Just 2 mins walk from the beach. And make sure you eat at Caravan beach restaurant.

The rooms are beautiful and spacious with an absolutely incredible housekeeping staff.
The staff as a whole are amazing with great communication! The daily surf schedule posted on the whiteboard and messaged out via WhatsApp to all of the guests makes keeping track of plans so easy.
The surf instructors are top notch. As someone who had never even touched a surfboard before I felt comfortable learning and had so much fun! The feedback the instructors provide is personalized and you can tell they care to see you progress.

The total for my meal came to 850,000 IDR, which included two cocktails during happy hour and a glass of wine. For my entree, I opted for tuna tartare, which regrettably had a notably fishy taste, and a pasta dish. The pasta was enjoyable; however, there was a slight misunderstanding with the waiter regarding the cheese topping. I inquired about Parmesan, but was unexpectedly served a large ball of mozzarella instead, adding another 80,000 IDR to my bill. While the ambiance of the venue was quite pleasant, be mindful that it is on the pricier side, and perhaps my choices that evening didn‚Äôt showcase the best of what they offer.",Super chill place with amazing food.

It's an all-inclusive feast that offers a wide variety of options.
