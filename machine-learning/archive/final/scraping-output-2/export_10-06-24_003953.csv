ChIJv_tYCBIX0i0Rn_MGS2i_Kpc,Goa Rang Reng Waterfall,-8.5155934,115.3313441,"Jl. Goa Jl. Rang Reng, Bakbakan, Kec. Gianyar, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80515, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=10892729103405216671,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.7,731,,"What an awesome experience we opted for the guided tour to explore the other 2 waterfalls and it was very beautiful. The guide was extremely nice and competent. He even stopped to make a small tiara from the leaves of the local plant/tree. He (Ade) was not in a rush to get us back, he took his time explaining the river, the falls, and the local area. One literally has to swim through one falls to get to the last falls. I really liked the entire experience. It started to rain as we headed to the main (public) falls and the water was a little rough, but still, it was beautiful to behold.","Its not much of a waterfall, rather then a very nice looking cascade stream. Nonetheless I enjoyed the visit and highly recommended it.

The entrance tickets are cheap (20k per person), that place has a big parking and can be accessed easily by car or bike.

Path to down to the waterfall is fairly short (10 min) and easy (stone walkways and stairs), but can become slippery during the rain (especially at the waterfall). The surrounding are decorated and therefore beautiful to look atüóø
Go straight to the waterfall, there is nothing to see near the temple on the left.

At the waterfall, you can climb to the center and lie down in the stream (with the guidance of locals overseeing the waterfall). Surprisingly, stones underneath the stream are not slippery at all so its not dangerous. Its a very enjoyable and calming experience.
There are toilets close to the waterfall where you can change clothes. And there is a clean puddle near the exit where you can wash your legs and face using a bucket.

For danger lovers, you can reach the top of the waterfall via slippery stone steps on the left. There you will find a cave with the stream going all the way through the cliffside.
You can climb onto the wall of this cave for a nice view, but do it at your own discretion, as it is quite dangerous‚ö†Ô∏è","went to 8 waterfalls so far and this is my favorite. You can even swim on top! It‚Äôs quite deep, you can jump ü§£ and overall it‚Äôs such a vibe. LOOK AT THAT BEAUTY. Friendly locals around too! AAAND it‚Äôs not that crowded! Only 25K entrance :)","Nestled in the heart of nature, Goa Rang Reng Waterfalls is a breathtaking gem that captivates with its pristine beauty. The cascading water, surrounded by lush greenery, creates a serene and refreshing atmosphere. The journey to the waterfalls adds an adventurous touch, making it a perfect escape for nature enthusiasts. While exploring this hidden oasis, I found the tranquility and scenic charm to be truly rejuvenating. A must-visit destination for anyone seeking a serene retreat in nature's embrace.","Goa Rang Rang Waterfall in Gianyar is simply refreshing! The cool, clear waters make it a perfect escape. It's not just good; it's the kind of place that gets a solid ""oke 4 lah"" rating. Definitely worth a visit for a nature-infused chill session! üåøüí¶"
