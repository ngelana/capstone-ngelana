Having your own private pool was fantastic. The bed was super-comfortable. Staff were all extremely helpful and welcoming.
The restaurants at the resort both had some great-tasting options, and there are plenty of other amazing places to eat/drink close by.
Would certainly stay again. Greatly enjoyed our time at Astera Resort Canggu - thank you!","We had really good time here. Canggu is great location close to cafes, restaurants, and beaches. Astera resort was always very helpful getting us drivers, a scooter, and other things. Great service.

One downside for me was the hotel towels. They felt a bit old and overused and I didn‚Äôt trust their cleanliness.

But otherwise the breakfast, dinners and all else was great.","All style, no substance.

My husband and I booked the Luxury Honeymoon Package, but it was anything but luxurious.

Unfortunately, our stay was disappointing. The room was nice and as expected, except for the view. The decoration of flowers in the pool was amazing, but that's about where the good stops.

At check-in, a bond is required, but they only accept credit cards. If you don't have a credit card, you're out of luck.

The food was terrible‚Äîserved lukewarm or cold and not fresh, with stale pastries.

If you're elderly or disabled, avoid this place. The pool in our villa had no stairs for easy access/exit.

The towels were in awful condition‚Äîold, fraying, and full of holes (see photos). Getting fresh towels was a hassle; we had to ask 2-3 times despite allowing reasonable time between requests.

Service is not a priority here. As mentioned, it often took multiple requests to get anything.

The main pool area is poorly maintained. Pool towels were rarely stocked, and empty drink glasses sat for days without being cleared.

The 'rice fields' view is not as depicted on the website, and there's a lot of construction near the main pool.

This place is more concerned with its Instagram appearance. A sign outside reception touting the villas as 'Insta-worthy' says it all.

We will avoid all iNi ViE hospitality in future.",All the staff are very friendly and greet you nicely. The rooms are amazing and the main pool is definitely worth going in at sunset. It is all very clean and breakfast included was superb. I couldn‚Äôt recommend more of a nicer place.,"I would like to express my gratitude for the exceptional service provided by the hotel reception staff during our stay in Astera Resort Canggu. When we encountered a problem with our room, the staff was quick to assist and went above and beyond to ensure that we had a memorable and comfortable experience. They not only resolved the issue promptly but also upgraded us to a more luxurious room for the remainder of our vacation.
We highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a memorable and delightful stay in BaliüáÆüá©"

Greeted by lovely friendly staff when I arrived and sat on a pre-booked pool lounger (definitely worth pre booking!)
They were doing 2 for 1 cocktails pretty much all day (12 - 4pm) and they were great. I also had some bites - the gnocchi is delicious, so flavoursome and also had the Parmesan and truffle fries which was everything and more.
The vibe was cool - a live DJ played chill house/light EDM/ a tiny bit of funk-pop - not my thing at all but certainly not offensive.

Perfect to laze around all day and have a dip. Loved it. Will be coming back.","The aesthetic of the place was visually appealing, creating a delightful atmosphere. Food was quite average

üçµMatcha latte had a pleasant sweetness to it, making it quite enjoyable.

The advantage was that it was easy to access; the disadvantage was that the vehicles on the road were quite noisy.

The room was clean, but the bathroom sink, taps, and shower head need replacement since they're already very worn down. Lucky for us, the owner of this hotel noticed the complaint and replaced all of them with brand new ones immediately.

The bathtub was OK, but there is not enough hot water for it to be fully filled. The owner needs to replace the water heater with one with a bigger capacity.

There was neither a TV nor a refrigerator inside the room, so you needed to go to the communal area for it.
The communal area was quite dirty; it definitely needs regular cleaning.

There was direct laundry service within the premise, so it's quite helpful for people who want to clean their clothes.

The overall experience was good but could be better.

4/5 Star.","We had a number of issues staying at this place and would not recommend it to anyone. We cut our stay short.

The biggest issue we had was that another guest had stolen our items from the communal kitchen. There were no repercussions for this guest apart from asking for payment. They should have had a strict policy and kicked this person out.
Also, even when I asked for the money to be returned to me, there were miscommunications and the full amount wasn‚Äôt there for me to receive.

Other things:

1. Very uncomfortable bed
2. Dirty shared kitchen
3. Sound traveled far (ai learned that wooden houses don‚Äôt have good sound insulation).
4. Shower was old and there was not enough hot water.
5. Location is far and without a scooter it‚Äôs dangerous to walk anywhere as you will be walking along a busy road.

The owner tried to resolve some of the issues we had, but of course we would have had a much better experience if they hadn‚Äôt happened at all. We found another place to stay and checked out at 11pm.

Note: in reply to the owners reply, the fridges were very dirty, I put my drink where it was still kind of clean. Other reviews have also mentioned how dirty the fridges were, it was not just me. The rest of the kitchen was fine and yes every room had their own cutlery and plates etc. I didn‚Äôt comment on that.

Nobody offered me 100K, plus I should not have to be the one offering change.

I could have addressed it with the customer if I had been around. But we left for three days an hour after I found out, leaving some luggage in the room. That is the only reason I didn‚Äôt check out straight away. Plus, I did not know who took it and it is the responsibility of the accommodation, is it not?

I never leave any bad reviews on Google unless it is really something worth mentioning. I don‚Äôt know where the owner got the notion that we wanted to stay longer and we were upset that we couldn‚Äôt. That is false. Through Agoda we shortened our stay until right after we came back from Java.","Beautiful houses and nice pool. Great value for the price.
Unfortunately the bathrooms are old and dirty.
Unfortunately we got obligated to lost the room key and the housekeeping Lady wanted to charge us extra.
The owner was really nice though and he came over and solved the situation.","Incredible friendly service across the board. I will say they have many friendly cats on property, so it‚Äôs not a great choice if you have a cat allergy, but that‚Äôs the only negative that I can think of.",Amazing!!!  staff is amazing accommodating to your every need.

I will definitely come back üôè","Lovely new place to stay a little tucked away from the hustle & bustle but still ideally located. The rooms are nice, tidy, the beds are SO SO comfy. I came back 3 times this time.
WiFi is relatively good for work.
When we arrived they had a BBQ in the garden - loved everything of it. Besides this, the team is a bunch of lovely, professional but so caring and loving people that I really felt like coming home every time - and sad leaving. Will return for sure and recommend it to all my friends ‚òÄÔ∏è","Absolutely!

Got the deluxe bungalow.

Room 1
Service 4
Location 4

The room is full of ants and bugs, there is netting which helps a little bit but the ants are everywhere, probably due to the room being a traditional room, so there are gaps in the wood where bugs and ants can get in.

The toilet is nice and clean-ish. again there are lots of ants everywhere.

Air conditioning is weak, and gets super hot during the day (you can feel the walls of the room are hot as well since the sun is shining right on it).

Walked past the other rooms, one door was open and I could feel the super cold air from the room so I knew it was just the deluxe bungalow that had weak air conditioning.

Asked to staff if we could look at other rooms to downgrade to, and at first staff said it was possible but I think after messaging the manager they didn't allow it and said that all rooms were booked (I don't know how legitimate this is because my girlfriend told me she saw the whiteboard they have and there were rooms available)

However, they do have laundry service and the receptionist was patient with me taking too long to get the clothes that I needed to wash.

Location wise i will say this is a quiet area in canggu so its relatively nice and peaceful?

Overall a general disappointment, will probably leave this room tomorrow as I can't stand so many insects where I sleep and judging from reviews some of the other rooms are not great either.",Lovely place to stay. Shared kitchen is not very clean tho but room and pool are nice,"The room was designed very minimally, had ants crawling around and there‚Äôs strong sewage smell from the toilet. Benefit is that there‚Äôs a balcony overlooking the pool for the units at level 2. For units at level 1, it‚Äôs quite exposed to everyone. This is located a distance away from the main restaurants, exercise studios and beach club which give it some privacy.","Pictures and old reviews were misleading as it seemed like this was a nice clean place but in reality it wasn‚Äôt. The bathroom was really dirty and smelly and the room had a strange odour that we had to buy air fresheners cos we could hardly sleep through the stench one night. The bedsheets also had a funny smell and were dirty and rough. It wasn‚Äôt all terrible because the staff were nice and chill, but i honestly think the management has been neglecting this place of late","Stayed in the bungalow and absolutely hated it. The aircon was too weak, making the room too hot. There were ants and mosquitoes EVERYWHERE. There are stains on the pillows and bedcovers, and the staff were extremely unaccommodating in our request to change rooms. Also, front desk is unmanned after office hours.

EDIT:
After posting this review, manager reached out through Agoda to try to accommodate to the change request but at this point I have already booked another room elsewhere. Wanted a refund but booking policy says no refunds allowed, despite me reaching out on both Agoda and Whatsapp to try to ask for a change of room just 2 hours into the booking. I also would like to note that I have already asked the staff beforehand to change the room and they said it cannot be done despite me seeing on their board that there were empty rooms. I am severely disappointed in their service recovery."

The room was clean, tidy and comfy.

Buana, Mo, Krabby. They were the staff there and made it feels like home. They were so helpful for the advice to do around Bali, even for the food!

Definitely would go back here again when I'll be back in Bali.

Keep the good work, champs!","The dorm has big and thick beds, super comfortable! Bathroom is clean and the staff is so friendly. Shout out to Buana, Mo, and Krabby.
It was a nice stay to meet with the other guests too! Travelled alone and become friends with so many good people there.
The location is good, there are minimarkets, pharmacy, and some cafe just outside the hostel.
Would come back again next time!","Great value for money, very good location and great host (thanks again Dani you‚Äôre a legend !)"

If you want delicious Italian food from a real Italian restaurant, this is definitely the place for you.

Thanks Luca and Team ‚úåüèº","First things first, the pizza is good enough that no one will be offended, but that's the best I can say about it. It won't win any awards and won't make a single person's ""Best Pizza in Bali"" list.

Similarly, we had the Bolognaise pasta and the spaghetti was chewy which was weird because it wasn't al dente or even hard, as I would expect it to be of undercooked. It was just... chewy. The sauce was similar to the pizza... good enough not to offend anyone but hardly can be considered ""good""

On top of the food, it must be mentioned that there is no dining room to speak off. Just a few tables open to the road, which wouldn't normally be noteworthy except that it was right by the road which made eating there hot, dusty and noisy.

Finally, we need to talk about the prices, which are very good for what you get. It's this element of value which nudges the restaurant from a 3 to 4 stars.","Ordered 2 pizza. Got them fairly quick. Ate them. Beyond satisfaction. Thin dough, delicious toppings, crispy crust, cheesy. Just good. (chili oil also has a good punch)","THE BEST PIZZA!
Amazing staff, friendly and helpful, several times we ordered pizza delivery from this shop through the Grab food app for our pool time or dinner, we have to say the pizza tasted damn good and it was a relaxed and very nice atmosphere when we decided to visit their store in Canggu, Plenty of attention put into the dough and sauce recipes.
Excellent place, with excellent food, no doubt! you guys should try it, even better visit the store because Grandma's Tiramisu is simply so good. Will be back and order some more for sure.","A very small pizzeria with limited space outside to sit, mainly focused on delivery. But despite the limited space, it is nice to sit there to eat and do some work. The menu is limited to a few pizzas, pastas and desserts, but the pizza I ate there was of excellent quality and very fine taste, definitely recommended to eat or order from!"

Please take care of him. Show him love, give him wet food, and allow him to sleep inside if you want to(he loves it).

The place has a lot of unexploited potential.
The place itself is not as well maintained as I anticipated. Cracking bed, very old doors, no decoration whatsoever making the rooms quite unwelcoming, old cabinets painted instead of replaced. The bad part for was the extremely pungent smell in the washroom coming from all of the algae growing on the shower floor, as well as the bathroom seat which was dark and moldy and smelly. I‚Äôve come to realize that most toilets in bali stink because the toilet seat lid is never cleaned, and accumulated pee on toilet seat lids isn‚Äôt a great idea for the most hygienic smell. You can literally smell it from anywhere in the bathroom.

The outdoor space is good, and the kitchen area is also okay. Maybe it was a stroke of bad luck but 90% of the people staying there(mostly russians) were extremely unfriendly and acted as though we were in their personal space and that we were bothering them.

To each their own I guess.","Really nice place! Very chilled out space, the staff are also very friendly and attentive - rooms cleaned daily - would recommend staying here.","Awesome accommodation!
The rooms are clean and very nice, bead and pillows comfortable, interesting bathroom with open part in the ceiling, the pool is perfect for day swimming and evening chill.

The rooms are a nice size, the bed and pillows are pretty comfortable, the pool is clean and nicely situated in the sun, the hotel itself is located off of a side street so it‚Äòs quiet at night.

It is more popular with locals than tourists, and the price is very reasonable, around 35-40K per person. The bigul is similar to Pak Malen's, but with fewer condiments, crispier pork skin, and a spicier sambal. The soup is served with ares. The restaurant is quite spacious and can accommodate more than 50 people. In my opinion, it was better a few years ago than it is now, in terms of portion size and price, but it is still one of the best in the area and tastier than Men L***.","Came here for lunch on my mission to eat all babi guling here„ÄÇmenu was easy with either campur or pisah option which is together with rice or separate, portions don't seem to differ that much?

Order came, I think highlight is the soup very tasteful and the pork skin is good but rest is tad boring the other meat supposingly be crispy aren't and the main meat too dry. Will give this a pass again.

Also not the cheapest for what it is.","Only 2 selections (mixed and separated) of the same dish which is still okay since that was what I came for. Their soup was super nice however the main dishes are just normal, better if they serve the main dishes hot","A babi guling joint frequented largely by locals. Tried it as was on the way to Uluwatu.

Restaurant set up was simple. Non air conditioned and back faces the padi field. Tables were sparesely laid out and felt quitr comfortable given the well ventilation by fans and natural breeze.

The babi guling rice was different from Ibu Oka. Pork is similar in texture but the sauce was different. I prefer Ibu Oka against this. Made a side order of pork skin and it was hard as with Ibu Oka's version. Much prefer the goreng version which is crispy. Price wise is about 45% lower vs Ibu Oka (Rp30k vs Rp55k).","It's decent babi guling at a good pics, 2 campur, 1 beer, coconut glass and juice.

It's not the best I've had, but it's pretty good still! And they're open till 830pm. Service is also fast and staff are fairly friendly.

Soup could be richer and more savoury."

Also you're able to whatsapp order & transfer pay ahead of time to secure some seafood which was a pretty cool. Kind prawns usually run out around 2pm so if you're really keen on them order ahead.
