The location is great and out of turisty, busy areas. The views are nice on green fields and mt Agung.
The owner is really nice too and also the lady which was cooking and looking after rooms.
The food there is really good.
The beautifull wooden huts just add on great atmosphere.
It is next to the road but we didn't find it too loud.","Loved my stay at Kubu Taru... the manager Gusti was so friendly and welcoming (all the staff was). The views are amazing, the food delicious:) I really enjoyed the bungalow setting.","View is beautiful, but sadly it's too close to the main road so not very peaceful. And a little far from all the restaurants. Unfortunately I changed my hotel, stayed only 1 night.","We ate here and the food was fantastic, a really lovely dinner and lunch spot!! The curry was outstanding!",Kubu Taru is a hidden gem. It brings beautiful rice fields right to your doorstep. It has a very raw and organic vibe. Beautiful way to watch the world pass you by as you are surrounded by greenery and mountains

Nice setting, beautiful clean kitchen, good food and plenty of parking.","Good warung to make a pit stop with views in this scenic road to Sideman valley. Ayam goreng and tempe are delicious (just ask what is fresh or available). We also got the hot tea with ginger, also nice. Lady running the shop is very friendly. Note for Bules prices are somewhat fluid :), just ask in advance.","Pros: very tasty food, nice view, got food relatively fast
Cons: don’t trust the pictures on the menu: we received 4 spring rolls instead of the depicted 6 and also didn’t receive a side salad (even though we specifically asked whether it was included before ordering). They then just said “not available”. Prices are relatively high, too, compared to other warungs","Tasty food, kind service and beautiful view at the mountains and rice terraces.","Our host stayed up late in the night for us after our boat had arrived much later than expected. After our taxi dropped us off at the wrong place he even picked us up, offered us drinks and he remained very friendly and open even though he had to get up early.
The area here is beautiful and calming, breakfast was delicious and the guest houses are very cozy."
