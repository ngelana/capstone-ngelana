We were looking for a quiet and peaceful place, and this is what we get. You can ear jungle sounds everywhere. The manager and his staff were so nice. The food was very good. I enjoyed my best manicure and pedicure (with full hands and foot massage) and balinese traditional massage. Def recommand it","If you are looking for privacy peace and serenity, this is it! I love how still it is and how beautiful it is. We booked the villa overlooking the jungle and what a way to wake up to the sunrise. They have a lovely swimming pool. You can choose when you would like to eat (within reason) and the manager was ace in terms of hospitality. Really high quality place from beginning to end. If I come to Bali again will definitely rebook this place üòçüòçüòç","This place is just awesome.
