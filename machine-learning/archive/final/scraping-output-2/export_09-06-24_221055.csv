It‚Äôs pandemic, no tourism, less staff probably. We just walked in, no reservation. Had we made one, they‚Äôd probably prep/clean the room. The twin beds were very comfy.

Had almost no sleep, since at 6 am people started to talk again in front of the room.

It takes around 15-20 minutes to reach Penimbangan or Lovina Beach. The price is reasonable 110k/nite on direct booking (I got 110.700 from Agoda) for room with fan (include breakfast). We found some bad points for their cleanliness, no blanket, no toiletries, even facility of wifi that we supposedly got from app booking, was not working. When I asked for wifi password to the front desk staff, she said the connection couldn't reach the backside (we got room at the back in this period).
