If we were going to stay in Ubud the whole trip then Dedari Villas would‚Äôve been the ONLY place we‚Äôd stay. From the staff at the front desk to the kitchen to the cleaning crew the service was amazing. The best part of the service was everybody‚Äôs awesome smiles, and gratitude. It was so contagious and welcoming. The rooms were also perfect and we LOVED the outdoor bathroom setup. We loved that breakfast was delivered straight to our room every morning so we could take in the beautiful view of the forest. But for us the best part was waking up every morning and sitting outside and relaxing to the sounds of nature. I would highly recommend Ubud Dedari Villas to anyone who wants to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city life. If you want to find a place that is modern, relaxing, friendly and rejuvenating then this is the perfect place for you!

Thank to all of the staff at Ubud Dedari Villas, see you again in the near future. From your friends in Villa 2","It was a wonderful stay, our villa was perfect. The bathroom was really beautiful. The pool was cold enough to cool down and the staff was helpful everytime we needed help.
Only things that could be better are the juices, it‚Äôs too watery and not sweet enough.","In general, we had a pleasant stay. The environment is absolutely beautiful with breathtaking views from the room and the pool area.
The location unfortunately has some cons as well. It is rather far from the city center (with busy traffic, it will take +/- 35min.) and grab/gojek/taxis at Ubud are not very cheap. We prefer to freshen up before dinner after a day of exploring, but opted not to because of this.
Furthermore, you stay in the middle of a wonderful jungle, which comes with all of its residents. We do not mind the occasional gecko, insect or even small snake, but a (seemingly) larger animal kept us awake at night as it sounded like it wanted to gnaw its way through our roof.
The inside of the villa was well-maintained.
The staff were very kind, but we missed the personal touches. Communications mostly went via WhatsApp, which they responded to pretty quickly.
Two small pet-peeves:
- You have to place your order for breakfast the day before. We received all of our breakfasts at least 10 minutes before the indicated time. It is not a big deal, but if you like to sleep until right before breakfast or take a shower before, it is not very handy.
- In the morning, the sun shines bright on the outside toilet, which is not ideal.
In short, we had a pleasant stay with a nice breakfast, friendly staff and unbeatable views. Some more attention to details might have made it even better.
PS: the taxi driver/guide that they recommend, Nyoman, is absolutely amazing!","I loved staying here. The service was great and everyone was super helpful, they even prepared some food for us that was not in the menu. The room was very clean, the bathroom was modern and the view from the balcony was amazing. Breakfast was sooo good as well.
The only thing I would add in the room would be a hairdryer.","Enjoyed my 4 nights here last month. The room was spacious with an enjoyable view of the greenery outside. Great customer service, super accommodating and polite (and even did up our room for our anniversary). The only thing that needs improvement is having more lights and shelter from reception to the rooms. Place can get very dark and slippery at night/during rainy seasons. Overall this is a great place and I‚Äôd definitely stay at this Ubud-solutely stunning villa again!!!"

They couldn‚Äôt do anymore for you if they tried. They will take you anywhere in ubud, and help you with anything you need.

Found this place on our way out of Ubud and I really recommend it.
The restaurant is behind a bus station with loads of souvenir shops in the parking of Goa Gajah and offers a bubble of peace and quiet.
The restaurant itself is really pretty, which a nice balinese vibe.
The food is great and filling, with a good variety.
The drink menu is really nice as well.
It's pricier than other places, but the surroundings, the calm and the flavourful dishes make it all worth it.","Authentic Balinese cuisine. Try the Crispy duck and also Spiced Stewed Duck, Bebek Betutu. Cant go wrong with this","Crispy duck is exceptionally good, highly recommended. We also ordered lamb and beef which was also good too!

Staff members are super nice, feels like family.","This is by far my most favorite accommodation I stayed at in Bali. If you want a real up close and personal view into authentic Balinese culture, in a clean, cozy and welcoming environment, Villa Bodensee is the place to stay. Purnama, the owner is a total sweetheart and opens her heart and arms to all that enter. I swear she speaks like 7,000 different languages and and communicate with anyone who says there! haha. She has a way of integrating her Balinese family and neighbors with the expats that tend to normally stick to their own. It was such a priceless opportunity to be able to spend time and learn with her about Balinese culture and the language, hang out and do yoga with the neighbor kids, explore the local spots to eat and adventure to. The rest of the staff and the locals who spend time at Villa Bodensee are truly lovely people who were always smiling and welcoming. I will definitely be returning to stay for even longer and hope to be able to book this legendary spot again for an extended stay.",Best place in around Ubud ever! The owner Melissa is so hospital!

The guest house offers what you basically need: aircon, hot water, furniture and king size bed; perhaps they need a working desk to make it perfect. There's also a shared kitchen where you can cook though you can also order fruits and food to them. Plus, they can also arrange motorbike rental for you.
