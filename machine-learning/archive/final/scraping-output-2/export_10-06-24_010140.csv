Clean and spacious rooms, beautiful pool, friendly and super helpful staff. Quite inexpensive if compared to similar guest houses in the area.","Loved this place so much! The room was clean and spacious, the bed was comfortable, the linens and towels were of good quality. The pool size was enough to have a dip on a hot day. The location is on a busy street, but the rooms are way on the back part of the site, so we couldn't hear the street noise. The owners were amazing and friendly. Would definitely stay here again and recommend this place to my friends.","I booked through an app and the room is still available. I paid and contacted the owner to confirm but there was no response. I went to the address all the way from the airport and guess what? There was no one at the receptionist and after a while the owner answered my call. He said there was no room available and asked me back who listed the room on the app, like what the f I could answer? In indonesian ""Lah kami tidak ada room, fullbooked. Siapa itu yang masukin kalo ada room kosong? Itu bukan kita"" You guys mismanaged. Like just think about it. How i could possibly book a room that is not available on the app. I sent all the receipts to validate my order to the owner and he simply said ""just ask for refund to the app"" and hung up on me then never replied on me. And guess again, their room isn't refundable. With patience and many days consultation with the app I got my refund. It wasn't easy. And after all of these, not a single sorry was said. You guys working on services and you guys failed miserably on your job. Get another one.",Very friendly and comfortable,Nice price so comfort

Highly recommend for a hassle-free and reliable biking adventure in Bali!","I have already rented scooters from Ketut Bagong during two Bali stays. The service is perfect. The communication via Whatsapp is fantastic, so I could already arrange everything from Germany. The employees are very service-oriented!
The prices are TOP, service perfect and the bikes that I have rented so far, were always in great conditions ( especially compared to many other providers).

Clear recommendation and I will always choose Ketut Bagong again!","Me and my wife rented a Yamaha NMAX here and we chose to have it delivered to our hotel and picked up by them on the last day.
They were punctual, we had no problems with the bike and they even gave my wife a new helmet.
Communication with them was really good and they answer quick on Whatsapp","Best bike rental out there. In addition to good prices and great bikes, they provide services like regular oil change or repair if needed. What's best, bikes come with their own insurance against scratches and bike stolen (just make sure to have keys and documents with you). They could also install surf racks if you ask for it. Communicating with them have been very easy, rental always respond quickly and in a constructive way. Definitely recommend them.","For the most part everything worked out.
