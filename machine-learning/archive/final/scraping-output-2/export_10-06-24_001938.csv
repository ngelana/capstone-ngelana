The staff were incredible and super friendly and welcoming. Pool area is lovely and they supply fresh towels for you.
Breakfast and dinner was delicious and great choices.

The only downside was the room was extremely damp constantly, mould in bathroom, even with the air con on, the bedding didn‚Äôt feel fresh and was damp, wasn‚Äôt nice to lie in. After 2/3days I developed a really bad cough from the dampness which turned into a bad infection then pneumonia. Which has ruined my holiday. As I can‚Äôt snorkel, scuba dive or do any strenuous activity (yoga, gym). Which I had all booked and payed to do. (Non refundable) And my medical bills are quite a lot.
I had to check out my stay early as I couldn‚Äôt stay there any longer as it made me so sick and was getting worse.

Such a shame as it is a very beautiful hotel and the staff are amazing. If you can handle the dampness and moisture then you will be fine. But just needed to let others know. I know the humidity can‚Äôt be helped with the location, but better measures could be taken in the rooms to dry them out and keep condensation and damp from getting too bad maybe? Apart from that I loved my stay and the pool access from my room was great. Thank you to all the staff üôèüèº","The resort is one of the most beautiful ones I have ever visited. The garden with the pool, the pond and small hut is like in paradise. The rooms are really nice and the restaurant serves really good food. Not to forget to mention is the Spa: the massages are just amazingly relaxing! Besides that the very best of the resort is the team! Everyone is so welcoming and charming! Special thanks to Ira for being a super good tour guide.
One thing is for sure: We will come back :)","A really really lovely location with rice terrace all around and far off views of the volcanoes, the restaurant is really yummy and huge variety of foods and it‚Äôs open quite late which was awesome plus the room service is perfect! The spa was lovely, the room is spacious and clean and feels pretty new, the bed was *so* comfy - I loved that there was a big desk. I easily stayed here for whole days while I focused on creative work. The pool is so nice and you can have your breakfast there which is really relaxing ‚ò∫Ô∏è
The staff are very sweet and did their best to make my stay enjoyable!
The location is pretty far out of anything walkable so you need to use gojek or grab or have your own scooter/driver.","We absolutely loved this place! We stayed here for two weeks last year and actually miss it! It‚Äôs a beautiful resort with everything you need to relax. We had a great, comfortable room with amazing views. It had a balcony, workspace and luxurious bed. The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was great. Often local entertainment in the restaurant at night. There‚Äôs a pool and a small gym that we both liked. It‚Äôs nice to stroll around the garden. The resort is pitched between the rice fields with some small restaurants nearby, but you need transportation to get to Ubud (there‚Äôs a free hotel shuttle 3x a day). We had an amazing stay and cannot wait to go back!","Amazing location, very friendly staff. Our stay in April 2024 for 4 nights was awesome! there is a shuttle bus from the resort to Ubud town 4 times a day which is a bonus. Breakfast is very good, dinner is okay."

The breakfast served was truly awesome! We indeed had a great time at this hotel!,"I stayed in a private pool villa that had a bathtub in the room, and I really enjoyed the spacious property and amazing vibe. My husband and I had a wonderful time during our stay. However, the only downside to this resort is its distance from the main market and poor connectivity. The street lights leading to the hotel also do not work properly, resulting in darker roads at night.","If you‚Äôre wanting somewhere very quiet and to get away from everything this place is perfect. We stayed 2 nights here and would definitely return but still keep it a short stay due to there being nothing around the area, so you are limited to staying in the villa (but this wasn‚Äôt an issue due to size of the rooms and there being restaurant on sight) The rooms are amazing, we booked the forest view room which was on 2 floors and very spacious. Staff are there for your every need and will try their best to give you the best stay. Food is very nice at the restaurant and the floating breakfast you can order is worth it.","Positive: fantastic room, absolutely loved everything about the room(except for random insects ;))
Negatives: I have travelled fair bit and never seen morning breakfast without cappuccino, I had to pay extra for it as it‚Äôs not part of their breakfast menu.
No vegan options for dinner.
You can‚Äôt have Indian food at restaurant but they can deliver to your room, doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. But if you choose a set menu option for dinner on Wednesday, you can have at the restaurant.
Bit disappointed with the food options to our fantastic stay.","Overall, the resort offers outstanding rooms with impressive amenities. However, the limited vegetarian food options, especially having only one breakfast item, may be a drawback for guests seeking diverse culinary experiences. It would enhance guest satisfaction if the resort expands its vegetarian menu to cater to a broader range of preferences. We asked for floating breakfast which was a good experience."

The ticket for the whole package costs 350 k per person and you can buy it before entrance. Staffs are professional photographers. All you need is just to give them your phone and they will get you nice pictures üòâüòâ,I made it just before they were closing and they still let me take pictures. They take really good ones and guide and suggest different poses etc. They have dress rental options too but cutting it so close to closing time I just rushed to get pictures and didn‚Äôt hire dress.,"There was no waiting when i visited the place.
Single swing costs 200000IDR and all swings costs 350000IDR. Costume charges and photography are extra.
But the trick is you can give your phone camera to the photographer to click pictures and he clicks decently..
Safety belt was provided and swings were decent enough for the experience.",Beautiful place the prices are not v high for the services and u can bargain some. The staff was extremely polite and helpful theu took all the pictures in a professional way. Do try their coffee amd taste different tea in the end. A good experience overall. Definitely recommended.,"It's a nice place for taking pictures but that's it.

You feel like you are pushed from photo spot to photo spot, take some quick pictures and move on to the next swing. It's okay and you will get some cool pictures but you can not enjoy the place or the swinging.

You have to pay 350000 IDR entry fee (around 25$/Person) to use all the photospots. It's also possible to rent different dresses but you need to pay extra if you want to use their dresses..

The view of this place is quite nice and the stuff is also friendly. But if you want to enjoy nature, have a nice experience and just explore with some nice swings, you are wrong.

It's not a crowdy place like a lot of the other Bali swings. When we were there, we were the only customer and that was very cool.

You have to sign a paper in case something happens to you but they safe you with a rope on every swing and photospot. I think it's very safe.

You start with some pictures in a round nest, then go on to a big swing (like you imagine the jungle swings) and you can take pictures all the time. You can also give your phone to them so they take pictures for you. It's also possible to let them take pictures with their Nikon camera and you can buy the photos at the end.

We used our own Sony camera and give the phone to the nice stuff. When we wanted them to take pictures with our camera of us together they just said no and told us, they will just do it with phone. I think, that's a bit sad because they just want to make the money with high quality pictures but ok.

It's also a bit like they rush from one swing to the next and want you to take the shots as soon as possible. I understand, that you can not take a lot of time if it's crowdy and other people waiting for the swing but we were the only people there and it was sad, we couldn't take our time.

One good thing is, that they tell you some photoposes and they really take nice phone videos. They know what they do to create the Instagram memories üòÖ but that's all it is. A place for Instagram Pictures..

It was okay because we just went there to take some cool shots but you cannot expect more from this place.

But i think the Ubud Jungle Swing is a much better choice if you do not want to be there with 100 of other tourists. And it's also a bit cheaper."

From the moment we arrived, we were swept off our feet by the breathtaking views.

The rooms at Sanna Ubud Hotel were nothing short of stunning. The architecture perfectly fused modern comfort with traditional Balinese aesthetics, creating a serene and luxurious ambiance that made it difficult to leave our cozy nest. The views from the room were providing us with a daily dose of paradise right outside our window. üèûÔ∏è

For my wife's birthday, the staff at Sanna Ubud Hotel helped me  surprised her with a magical floating breakfast experience and a bathtub filled to the brim with vibrant flowers. üå∏ This added a touch of romance and whimsy to our stay.

The service at the hotel was exceptional. The workers were genuinely kind and welcoming. Their warm hospitality made us feel right at home, and their efforts to ensure our stay was nothing short of perfect did not go unnoticed. üíñ

Moreover, the food at Sanna Ubud Hotel was a delightful culinary journey. Each meal was expertly prepared and served with a smile. üçΩÔ∏è

Warm regards,","Absolutely incredible! Firstly the staff at Sanna are very welcoming and friendly. They'll always say hello and ask how your day is going and whether you need anything.

The hotel itself is unbelievable. Everything is themed so nicely and we'll set out. The on-site restaurant is amazing and the pool is amazing.

This was my first time in Bali and I can guarantee anytime I come back on the future, I'll be staying at Sanna.","Hands down THE BEST HOTEL IN ASIA. This place is an unforgettable life experience. From the moment you check in you will be transported to another world. I have stayed in 6 star hotels around the world that don't even come close to this place.

The staff are absolutely faultless, extremely welcoming, happy and go out of their way to make you feel special and will make your stay here truly a memorable one.

The rooms are breathtaking, clean and well appointed with nestled in perfectly manicured gardens and a lush tropical rainforest.

The food is another massive highlight. The Vanara restaurant serves up better cuisine than Michelin star restaurants. Every dish I had on my 5 night stay blew my mind in freshness, flavour and execution.

Do yourself a favour and stay here, it's well worth the travel.","If I could give a star classification to this hotel I would give it 10 stars! What a breathtaking location. The spa down the hill made us feel like we were in heaven. I have no words to describe how amazing this hotel is. The staff made us feel very welcome. The view from the room, the restaurant is mesmerizing. Sanna is one of the best hotels we have ever visited. We will definitely come back. Thank you for having us!","Beautiful hotel with some of the best service. All staff are always smiling and very helpful. Rooms and yards are exclusive and gives a feeling of tranquility and peace.

Have all the facilities you need and they are fully staffed even outside the high season.

Can highly recommend the hotel."

PS : bring your snacks, drinks or any kind of food that you like. Cause it's kinda far from crowd center of Ubud","Think again before booking !!

We were travelling with a 2 year old kid and stayed at Bima 5 room for 2 nights .

Worst was on last night at this hotel , we found an animal on the roof of room at around midnight.

We called reception and person said he‚Äôs coming. But he didn‚Äôt show up.

I went to find person but couldn‚Äôt find anyone in the reception , restaurant or the security gate .I called contact available online but they didn‚Äôt also respond .

2 person came after 45 minutes . There excuse of coming late was they were doing check-in for other customer .

After they reached , they found gap in the roof . We were shifted to other room but the night turned to horror night .

They have no provision in case of emergency.Nor do they have sufficient staff . They had only 2 people running complete hotel after 10 pm .

If you are travelling with kid then don‚Äôt book. They don‚Äôt offer free baby food , nor is the hotel baby friendly. There is no safety for the small kids , no kids play area and the swimming pool is 5.5 feet deep.

They have 2 swimming pools but the one near waterfall was not clean.

The food is average with limited choices for vegetarians. Breakfast buffet is 1/5. You have to order breakfast a day in advance .

My wife specifically asked for omelette without cheese but got with cheese .

The cleanliness of room was okay but the rooms are outdated . It‚Äôs having 1990‚Äôs vibe.","We came to stay in January 18th to 21st. The weather was amazing, staff were truly excellent and couldn‚Äôt do any more for you if they tried. Rooms were really specious, clean and stocked with everything you may need during your stay including toothbrush, hairdryer, shower gels, tea/coffe and daily restocked bottles of water.

Couldn‚Äôt recommend this place enough, really worth the visit if you‚Äôre planning on staying in Ubud!","WOW! Our favourite stay in the whole of Bali üòç You really have to see this place in the flesh to appreciate its beauty - the photos really don‚Äôt do it justice! It is probably the most unique hotel my partner and I have ever stayed at. The hotel is situated in the heart of a tropical jungle, full of plants, flowers and wildlife. Our gorgeous, villa style room was spacious, clean and authentic. The infinity pool is just gorgeous and long enough to swim properly in! The surrounding restaurant toilets and showers are incredibly well kept and to top it off, the staff were absolutely lovely from the moment we arrived to when we left. We loved it so much, we have changed our plan and are staying longer! The hotel is surrounded by stunning rice fields and is only a short moped drive away from amazing bars and restaurants. My only negative comment is that the only alcoholic drink the hotel sells is beer (but that is very subjective!) and the breakfast was average but included in the price so we skipped it the second day.. Other than that, I would highly recommend, great value for money and an unforgettable experience - thank you! ü•∞"

my favorite thing from this homestay is definitely the surrounding. we woke up to walk around when the sun rises and then we went to the nearby waterfall before going back to the homestay to soak in the pool and have breakfast.

i think they offer day trips packages and classes and also motorbike rentals","Dukuh village villas is a family guesthouse in the middle of the rice fields.

He said that this room is not valid for the short term. He suggested the bungalow house. I didn't like it either because it wasn't the same situation. Moreover, he increased the price the next day. So he left me in a difficult situation because of his own mistake. To help him, I told him I can keep it for 15 more days if you keep the price the same. So 30 days. But he didn't accept it.

My favourite was the vanilla coffee. The host explained the whole process very clearly. We enjoyed our time there and we took really nice pictures.

We would have liked to buy more tea and coffee to bring to our friends but we found them rather expensive.","Amazing place, the variety of tea and coffee alone will sell you on the experience, but what really did it for us was the lovely atmosphere and friendly staff. My girlfriend wasn't feeling too well before we arrived, and while we were being given the tour, she collapsed from heat exhaustion. The staff were so quick to help her and we felt so much safer thanks to them. I know how stressful that situation can be for a worker, but they handled it amazingly well. I'm really grateful for everything they did for us, and the food was top notch too, it revitalised both her and I. Our favourite drinks were the mangosteen tea and the ginseng coffee!","Beautiful view, lovely staff and fantastic products. Come and see a happy and well fed Luwak in person!!","Very nice people, they explained everything about Luwaks, Luwak Coffee and about Indonesian agriculture. The Jungle view is also nice. They also offer to taste different coffees and teas for free.","They explained how the coffee is produced and gave us a tasting, the view is nice.

The place is humble and quite far
Price is cheap and nett with no tax. So I'm curious if they pay tax?

Alot of influencers mention this place but came up with tourist trap."
