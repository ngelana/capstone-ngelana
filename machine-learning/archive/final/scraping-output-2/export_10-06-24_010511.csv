What a surprise to discover welcoming staff, a very comfortable and clean room as well as a very pleasant swimming pool in this heat!  Possibility of dining on the terrace of our room, the breakfast was fabulous, we had the fruit platter.  We would have liked to spend more time in this place.  Without knowing it at the time of booking, the manager is French just like us, we highly recommend!  thank you again Amélie, Marine and Nolwenn",This hotel is a perfect quiet oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Sanur. The staff were very accommodating to every enquiry we made. Breakfast is excellent!,"If you’re looking for serenity, this is the place. They also have massage services at a very reasonable price. The staff is wonderful. I highly recommend this peaceful hotel.","Tropical hotel bali is a beautiful hotel in Sanur. Located at a 5 min walk from the black sand beach, it's tucked away from the hustle and bustle. The rooms are large, spacious and very clean . The hostn Audrey and Mathhiew are always ready to help. They weren't there during our stay, but despite that, they always made sure to make us feel comfortable and attended to all our queries. We even got a free upgrade to another pool side room.

Immediately when we arrived we were welcomed by very friendly staff and got offered watermelon juice.
We were taken to our villa which was really clean with a nice temperature because of the aircon. It was spacious and we each had our own bathroom which was outside the villa but completely hidden from the outside.
In the morning they made as breakfast as we sat down at the pool.

Each time we had questions the staff was kind to help us and each time we passed them we were greeted very kindly. You can tell that they love what they do.

I wanna say a big thank you to Herman and his staff for making our stay so pleasant","I recently stayed at a hotel and I must say, the staff was absolutely amazing and helpful. I had to check out very early in the morning, before the chef had even arrived. They went above and beyond to prepare a delicious meal of fried rice and noodles for my entire family. Not only that, but they also packed up some fresh fruits for us to take on our journey. The food was incredible, and I am extremely grateful for their thoughtfulness. It truly made our stay even more memorable. The only downside is that it is a hidden place and hard to find when we arrived in the evening.","Stayed for 2 days. Very friendly staff, full time at your disposal. Mr Herman is extremely helpful. Very clean quiet and beautiful place. Will definitely stay here in the future.","We had an amazing stay. The staff were so kind and their warm hospitality made us feel like family. The bed was so comfortable, the room and bathroom very clean.

The guys are nice. They prepared early breakfast because we had to leave early."

We enjoyed the complementary breakfast especially fresh coffee and juice. The staff were friendly and very helpful. We had an amazing stay and it was a wonderful introduction to the beautiful Island of Bali. The Villa is everything you would want from a boutique hotel. Most importantly, you feel at home. We especially enjoyed lounging on the upstairs balcony in the evenings, relaxing in the cool air and watching the clear night sky.","The property is located in a super quiet neighborhood. The room itself is beautiful, super clean, with incredible AC and a very comfortable bed. The breakfast was also delicious, and we loved that we could enjoy our coffee on the second floor balcony amongst the plants and sun.

What really stood out was Hendra (our lovely host) going above and beyond to help us with extending our tourist visa (this was a process that we weren’t familiar with and needed additional information in order to complete in a very short period of time). After a super long day of travel and exhaustion, he came to save the day and took the level of hospitality we once knew to new heights. His care and kindness will never be forgotten and we’re really grateful we chose to stay at Verdant. A sincere thank you to you Hendra, you’re one in a million. Hendra is the reason we’re able to enjoy the last 2 weeks of our vacation in Indonesia worry free. If you’re staying in Sanur, I highly recommend staying at Verdant!",,,
