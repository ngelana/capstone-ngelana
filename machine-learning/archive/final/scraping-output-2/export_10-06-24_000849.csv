It is worth traveling to west Bali to escape the hustle & bustle of other typical Bali locations. The resort is spread out and gives you the feeling you are in a tropical oasis with beautiful landscaped gardens right on the beach. Our pool villa was magnificent and very private. We really enjoyed having our own private pool & the amazing enclosed outdoor shower. All the staff were very friendly & attentive. Special mention to Made, restaurant manager, for always making sure our restaurant experience was enjoyable. Ketut, the great chef who provided a cooking class, which was lots of fun & to Made, who took us on a walking tour around the local area. Other must do experiences are the cultural Bali night. This was a fun night & watching the local young girls dance was very special. The spa treatments were exceptional. The resort surprised us with a special last night private  dinner set up on the beach which made our stay even more memorable. We loved our stay here. It really was an incredible resort to sit back & unwind. We felt it was only us there as there is hardly anyone on the beach except the odd fisherman. We will definitely be coming back to Kelapa!","Great place for a restful vacation! We visited to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and at first, we couldn't believe how picturesque the place was, almost like a scene from a postcard. Very quiet, situated by the seaside. The resort consists of individual villas; ours came with a pool, but there are also options without. However, I would suggest adding more variation to the meals in the restaurant. While the location and ambiance were fantastic, after staying for two weeks, the meal options started to feel repetitive.","The journey from DPS airport to Kelapa took us 4hrs though it‚Äôs a 65km distance. But all I will say is it was worth it. If you are looking for somewhere to relax, unwind and breath, this is the perfect place for you. The spa overlooks the ocean, so you hear the sound of the waves as you are being massaged by some real good professional ladies. The staff were the highlight for us. They are the most genuine people we have ever met. Made us feel like we were with family. They are good at reading their guests moods and adapt to each guest making them feel special. The hotel organizes activities each day but they are not overwhelming. The value for money is a nice surprise as we didn‚Äôt spend almost half of our budget. Not forgetting the local people, they were so friendly and welcoming, you can attend a wedding without an invitation. You can tell they don‚Äôt get too many tourists. We would go back again in a heart beat.","The villas, grounds, views and staff are magic. There is little else to say. i stayed in the beach-view pool villa which is large, beautifully appointed and with the most stunning view imaginable. All staff are extremely friendly

Two caveats -
1. The hotel is a little removed from the nearby town(s), which is great for some and less ideal for others. Something to note.
2. The beach in front of the hotel is TREACHEROUS. A big and shallow sandbar continually forms about 100m offshore, causing very dangerous currents for the inexperienced, powerful dumping surf, and unconfirmed reports of a local resident of the large-tooth variety. It is manageable in some conditions, outright deadly in others, however it may not impact those only looking to go in waist deep.","We‚Äôve stayed at Kelapa retreat a few times now and each time it gets better. It was outstanding the first time  we stayed so as you can imagine, we are impressed! This place is so tranquil and peaceful. It doesn‚Äôt have the hustle and bustle of most hotels. The staff are welcoming, helpful and smiley. The smiles are genuine and heartfelt and there is genuine desire to make your stay a perfect one.
The rooms are fabulous and the location stunning. We walked often on the beautiful  beach, in both directions often not seeing another soul, apart from the occasional fisherman up to his knees in the ocean trying to catch supper. It‚Äôs difficult to stay at another hotel when you‚Äôve experienced Kelapa retreat, the standard set is so high. We look forward to returning, as soon as we can."

I wish I had another month in Medewi to work my way through every item on the menu. Everything is just perfect. We stayed three nights at Kelapa Retreat and had breakfasts and dinners at Tides. The service is excellent, with everyone so attentive and kind. The chef often greeted us to ensure our meals were perfect. And they were! The coconut cream pie, the coconut crusted fish, the beef rendang, the coconut pumpkin soup, and our last dinner (the whole snapper special). Perfect beautiful presentation and delicious flavor.","This place was the perfect place for us on our way back from the ferry terminal.
