They are pet friendly so we brought our little pet along.

Their lunch menu was unexpectedly good. We tried their tongseng and ayam goreng lengkuas lunch packages. Their coffee was so-so though.

The place is very spacious indoors, there are some outdoor tables too. Their parking area is really spacious since they are sharing it with a villa.","Mesmerizing place to have a chit-chat w/ ur company, with a view that worth enjoying, or just doing your WFA here. A quite, neat, cozy & aesthetic place, you might  like it. Also the food is tasty, i recommend u to try their TKD Steak Don, this is the best so far. 8/10","Amazing place! We are so glad we found it. Very tasty food for good prices, alc drinks for 30k, beautiful restaurant with very nice staff and friendly atmosphere.  People were there working on laptops, European style. Fresh croissants (chocolate, almond.. price around 20-30k per one).
We had chicken curry, some spicy bowl and calamary appetiser. Drinks were also very tasty.","Nice place to catch up with your friend! TKD provided 2 seating areas, indoor and outdoor. I love their interior because it was really cool and classy. The ambience was so good! Yeah good enough for you who are looking for a place to do your work or just studying. They offered many variants of menu, such as appetizer, dessert, main course, and also snack bites. It tasted good with affordable price. They also had a spacious parking area, you dont need to be worry for losing your parking space ckckcküëç","This place is spacious and surround with trees. I came here for breakfast.

This is the only accomodation in Bali that not accept check-in in midnight, the only ONE since i visit Bali for many years.
Cannot contact the staff at the accomodation, i have to contact the customer service which have a very slow respond.
Told them that my flight was delayed, so i have to check-in in the midnight. They don't accept it, even when i arrive at the location at around 12 am, there's nobody at their ""lobby"", they only put a SICKLE to watch their guest. Oh terrible.
I waste my money for this terrible accomodation with very bad service.
1000% wouldn't reccomend it for anyone who visit Bali.","It allows check-in at 14.00; and check-out at 12.00

Rooms and bathrooms are clean, equiped with TV, wardrobe, table & chair, towel, toothbrush, toothpaste, soap bar, standing shower, and closet.

Common room at first floor are equipped with shared toilet, refrigerator, water dispenser, dishwasher cabin, sofa. This common room is also used as waiting room and temporary luggage storage","During my recent travels, I had the opportunity to stay at a modest Cove that proved to be a comfortable and affordable option for budget-conscious travellers. While it may not boast the lavish amenities of a high-end hotel, it offered a pleasant and hassle-free experience that exceeded my expectations given its affordable price point.
Upon check-in, the Cove staff greeted me with friendly smiles and efficiently handled the check-in process. They were helpful in providing information about the local area, including nearby attractions and dining options, which was appreciated as a first-time visitor.
The room I stayed in was clean and adequately furnished, offering all the essential amenities needed for a comfortable stay. Though the d√©cor may have been basic, the bed was comfortable, ensuring a decent night's sleep after a long day of exploring. The bathroom, while not luxurious, was clean and functional, with a sufficient supply of hot water and toiletries.
While the Cove did not have an on-site restaurant, it was located near several dining options, including fast-food chains and local eateries. This allowed me to experience the local cuisine without having to venture too far from the accommodation.
In terms of amenities, the Cove offered complimentary Wi-Fi, which was a welcome addition for staying connected during my trip. Overall, the Cove provided a cosy and cost-effective retreat for budget travellers. It offered the basic necessities for a comfortable stay and a convenient location for exploring the surrounding area. If you are seeking an affordable accommodation option without compromising on cleanliness and service, this Cove is worth considering.","I had a very unpleasant experience with the deposit refund from Cove. I already signed a contract that I will stay at Cove for 3 months, starting 10 Dec 2022 to 10 Feb 2023 and that they will return my deposit money maximum 2 weeks after I‚Äôm out of the property. After waiting for 2 weeks since I was out from Cove Griya Elite Sanur to get my refund back, there‚Äôs no response whatsoever regarding my refund. I tried to contact them on 26 Feb and asked them to proceed the refund but very slow response. Long story short, after some attempts to get my refund back, they finally sent the refund on 28 Feb evening. I was very upset with the slowness and the CS response from Cove. It was my worst ecperience dealing with CS of an ‚ÄúExclusive Kost‚Äù. They made the rules and asked us to follow all the procedures and yet they don‚Äôt proceed accordingly. And we cannot speak to them directly on the phone as there are no number given to call, only via WA chat! Please consider to stay in any of Cove Properties for your convenience!",Very nice rooms in a quiet area!

The room is exceptionally clean, comfortable, and elegantly simple. The host is incredibly welcoming, with a distinctive touch in the decor that adds a personal flair. The proximity to the seaside makes it convenient for travel. Absolutely fantastic!","A hidden gem! The spectacular villas exceeded my expectations in every way. From the luxurious amenities to the serene surroundings, it's a paradise for relaxation and indulgence.

""Convenience at its finest! This villa's prime location strikes the perfect balance between beachside bliss and urban accessibility. Just a 5-minute stroll to the beach and a mere 20-minute drive to Denpasar city, making it an ideal choice for those who want to soak in the sun and explore the city with ease.‚Äù","The stars are just for the location, the staffs, and the bed. The location is great! Not too far not too close from crowd area and beach, plus it‚Äôs easy to find foods. For the staffs, they are nice and friendly. And the bed is really comfy and soft since they added an extra cover on top to make it softer.

The rest? Hmm not so nice. The first week i stayed, there were issues with the water heater, there is no hot water. And it‚Äôs solved in 1-2 weeks after the complaint.

Not just water heater, there comes the wifi. The connection is bad. It‚Äôs so unstable. If I come to Bali for healing this is probably a great place! Since you can literally take my mind off of the world since the internet hardly there. But since 99% of my work is digital and online, it causes me a lot of issues. The downloading and uploading is so slow that sometimes I have to use my personal hotspot. It costs me a lot tbh. I mean they fixed it at the end, they said they have upgraded it. 2 days before my check out. But not sure how it is now tho.

Drinking water. So you can take water from the kitchen. The problem is, they have to be constantly reminded that they need to change/refill it, if not then probably get 1-2 days of no drinking water so I had to buy it from nearby store.

The room. It‚Äôs pretty small, packed, but feel pretty nice to me. You can get woken up by sunrise in the morning (if you forgot to close the blind)

The bathroom. It‚Äôs clean, not much issue, only 1. Whenever you take a shower, you‚Äôll get a puddle of water. Not sure where it‚Äôs from but tbh it‚Äôs pretty dangerous if ever got slipped from it.

The cleaning. I‚Äôm still unsure of their schedule there but they cleaned it for 2-3 times a week. But bear in mind, they dont change the towels and the sheets.

Stayed for 2 months here and I wished I had a back up plan instead of spending my last month in Bali here.","Charming & comfortable stay, very nice place with nice tropical vibes. Room is good with spacious bathroom, plenty of natural sunlight. Kitchen is fully equipped, with ample space to sit down and chill. Located very close to the beach (5 min bike ride). Plenty of good & affordable food choices nearby. Internet is fast. They also have a cute bike to use for shopping around the area.

Cleaning lady Komang is also very nice & accommodating. The owner Gerry‚Äôs really friendly & helpful. Really enjoyed my stay in Sutji. Would totally recommend anyone to stay here.","If I had a much time I'd stay longer here, the owner and staff were so nice to everyone. I can say this villa has a good vibe for nomad work, there's no traffic noise or dog's bark around. Oh ya, there would be upcoming projects, sounds like a great deal to stay on next timeüòâ"
