The Falcon Villa was incredibly cozy and romantic, and the Hideout staff did a tremendous job taking care of every need!  Loved the abundant bistro menu (breakfast, lunch, dinner), our couple's massage, and the complimentary scooter to cruise around the area.  Absolutely worth it for those seeking a quiet, tranquil getaway.  Would love to return and experience another one of their beautiful villas.","I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Hideout Bali and it exceeded all my expectations. From the moment I arrived, I was warmly greeted by the attentive staff who made me feel right at home.
This place itself is a true oasis in the jungle. The ambiance is serene and peaceful, providing a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life.
One of the highlights of my stay was the impeccable service. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of my stay was perfect. Whether it was arranging transportation, recommending local attractions, or catering to special requests, they were always there to assist with a smile.
Overall, my experience exceptional. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing getaway. I can't wait to return for another stay in the near future.","Our stay at Hideout Bali in the Horizon was truly exceptional. The bamboo house was a unique and comfortable place to stay, providing a sense of being immersed in nature without sacrificing comfort.

The setting of Hideout Bali is stunning, surrounded by lush jungle and offering a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The outdoor bathroom was a highlight, allowing us to shower under the open sky surrounded by the sounds of nature.

The staff at Hideout Bali were friendly, attentive, and made us feel at home throughout our stay. We also enjoyed the delicious meals prepared for us, featuring local ingredients and flavors.

Overall, our experience at Hideout Bali was memorable and we would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful and unique stay in Bali.","Everything was just perfect! We were welcomed with the words: ""Welcome to the jungle"", which was absolutely true. Yes, it is basically in the middle of nowhere, but this was the best experience we had in Bali! From every detail of every room (we stayed in the lighthouse and in the Beehive), to the kindness of the staff and service, to the quality of the food - it was just perfect!

I can highly recommend anyone staying there for at least 2 nights and get some quiet in this wonderful accommodation. We also took a scooter to explore a bit the surrounding, which is easily possible.

Thanks again for this unforgettable experience!
❤️","Loved my stay at Hideout! It was my first time and was blown away by the staff, house, and beauty around the area. As a content creator, Hideout reignited my passion for shooting again and I'm so grateful. Thank you to the team at Hideout for making my trip unforgettable - I cannot wait to come back next time!"

The place is beautiful and clean and has an enclosed bedroom upstairs. It overlooks the rice fields and Mount Agung. A beautiful stay if you’re looking for peace and quiet in nature. Breakfast was brought right to the villa, they have bike rentals for you to use during your stay, good Wi-Fi, and you can take a walk through the rice fields. Perfect stay in Sidemen!","“The Rude House” - My partner and I were very excited to stay at The Nude House yet decided not to after realizing the host Eva cared more about not losing out on a nights charge than us feeling safe.

We specifically planned our trip for July since it’s dry season for Bali. Unfortunately it’s been everything but. Getting around the “city esque” areas like Canggu and Ubud hasn’t been the easiest but manageable. However, after heading North from there the roads are less developed since it’s more jungle area and after barely making it to our next destination because of the heavy rainfall I contacted Eva about altering our check in date for a day later to wait out the rain in our then current lodging because we didn’t feel safe being on the road to go to Selat. Especially with their own description of the property being “The Nude House is located off a small road in the jungle. It's off the beaten path.”

She at first seemed understanding and offered their driver to pick us up to which we replied that we had already contacted him and arranged for pick up for the following day. All I was needing from them was to approve our check in date change from July 8th to July 9th. I went through the proper channels of contacting her first then submitting my request which per their own policy granted me a refund for the first night.

She came back stating they don’t allow last minute cancellations to which I corrected her in stating I was not requesting a cancellation I was requesting a date change (which are literally two different request actions on the app to choose from).

She ignored my last message and wrote back letting me know she had notified the staff that our arrival would be July 9th not the 8th. I thanked her for updating everyone then said I just needed the approval on my request. She came back saying “you’re welcome” once again only responding to specific parts of my message.

(I will include screenshots of the conversation, it was just ridiculous and obvious at this point what was happening).

I sent her a screenshot of my pending request telling her it still hasn’t been approved. She then tells me that if they accept the request they’ll lose out on a night charge and I would automatically be refunded. To which I replied “okay great thank you” because per the policies they have set up, cancellations get charged and date changes get refunded.

The morning of my original check in date arrives, July 8th, still nothing. I message her explaining that unfortunately the weather has caused many issues and it’s no one’s fault however I am within rights to make these changes on my reservation in compliance with their own policies.

Ultimately she stuck to it that “essentially” what I was requesting was to cancel one day and that even though I am allowed to request a change in my reservation it’s up to them to accept it or not. They were okay with my date change request however would not formally approve it on Airbnb because they didn’t want to refund me the nights visit. So it’s fine as long as it’s “under the table.”

I stopped going back and forth with that woman because clearly they just care about the money and we were getting no where so I contacted Airbnb directly. I will be filing a claim against The Nude House.

It’s neither theirs or mine fault about the heavy rain but policies are set in place for a reason, policies that the Host themselves created. It’s not even about the money anymore for me because I had already spent the money to stay with them having paid everything in full months in advance. I clearly intended to stay at the bnb but things happen and I think it’s unethical they approve my request under the table and refuse to approve it through the proper channels because they don’t want to refund me.

On that bases alone I would not recommend a stay with The Nude House as the host has made it evident what their priorities are and it’s not your comfortability, safety or correctness.","This place is amazing, it’s a very unique stay. It’s the perfect place to relax while having an amazing view of the rice fields and Mount Agung. Everything looks like in photos and the place is clean.
Special shout-out for the extremly helpful and friendly staff Dika. He helped us with our luggage transfer and brought us breakfast even if was way to early in the morning.",,
