The rooms are simple but clean. The family owning this place are wonderful people. They are friendly and helpful and will give you the opportunity to get a closer look at the traditional life in Bali. We are looking forward to come back soon!,"Very quiet, but pretty far from everything. Cars cannot reach it, so good luck with your luggage. Friendly owner but the stay was a bit disappointing. No airconditioning, no sink, a thick and rough blanket to sleep under.","Awesome homestay! The owners are so cute and heartful, its unbelievable. Also the village is very nice as its close to ubud but still very traditional and quiet. They rent motobikes for a reasonable price and tell you where to go best for eating, shopping and your best Bali experience possible. Terima Kasih Mama&Papa :)","Cozy place to stay, friendly owner, morning tea and fried banana was great. Clean and safe. Second floor was better","New upgrade with hot water , last year when I was here there's not hot water ,I love this place üòçüòçüòçüòç"

Unforgettable ambience of a place, comfortable rooms, peace and quiet by the forest. Very good place to travel with a motorbike from here, close to all of tourist attractions in the area. Delicious food and very friendly and helpful owner. I wish to bring all my friends here.","For budget travelers who look for a secluded place this guesthouse are good, low prices, including breakfast, and just next to a river. However there are some minuses that you can expect from such a place, this place had not enough power supplies, so you must expect electricity down if they were at full, mosquitoes, flies and bugs are expected here, be prepared with some repellant. Other than this location are not in central ubud but the best thing they offer you is a feels living like in a village as they have paddies field within the area.","Beautiful and quiet place. It's located close to the river and jungle among charming village. Host was very friendly and helpful. Room was spacious, bed comfortable and breakfasts very tasty.
