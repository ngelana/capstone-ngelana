This is not a tourist place, when we pulled up Nyoman had a wide smile and said ‚ÄúHello, we only serve local food. Is that OK?‚Äù

Nyoman and his wife proceeded to make the absolute best satay we‚Äôve ever had. $1.50 for FIFTEEN pieces. The peanut sauce was amazing, savory and not too sweet.

Nyoman talked to us about his two kids in school and how he moved back from being a driver in Nusa Dua to be closer to his family.

He taught himself to cook from watching YouTube but you‚Äôd never know it.

If you‚Äôre staying or near with Amed do yourself a favor and make the 15-20 minute drive. The scenery on the way is not bad either.","It's one of the best sate ayam in the area! Tasty, savory, and juicy. Try pairing it with soto ayam (Indonesian chicken soup) and rice/ rice cakes. Affordable with a nice atmosphere. Lovely owners!","Stumbled upon this place a day where I was looking for cover from the rain on my scooter. BEST random encounter! The food was absolutely delicious and the couple running the place were unbelievably sweet and used to be in the tourist industry so had great advice for new areas to explore, if you are looking for that too. Both the chicken satay and noodle soups are spectacular!","Outstanding little warung serving incredible Bakso Ayam (meatball soup), Soto Ayam (chicken soup) and mind-blowing Sate Ayam (chicken satay with peanut sauce). Good local prices. Super friendly service from the owner and the cook. Super reccomended.","Very kind and welcoming
Grill chicken was the best best best thing I ever had in bali. Please try the grill chicken sate ayam here. Tasty and economical as well."
