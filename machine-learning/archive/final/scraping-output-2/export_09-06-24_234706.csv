🚫 Come early

We waked-up early to enjoy the volcano view and discovered this restaurant on the road. What an awesome suprise 😳

The view is just perfect, the food is fresh and really good. One of my best fried eggs!

THANK YOU for this great moment 🙏

The prices are worth the view and the food quality!

Be patient as they are doing each dish freshly and homemade :)
