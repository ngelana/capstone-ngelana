The meats, spice, veggie were the perfect balance. However for me who can't eat spicy food, their sambal is very spicy but tasty.
Food took a bit of time to arrive. Friendly staff.","Good ambiance, and it was cool, although the sun was shining...

We don't have to wait too long from the food order..
And the wood was good....","Good food, crispy and yet very tender pork, spicy sambal, Amazing pork ribs that are soft and filled with bbq flavor. Best part is The Friendly staff, reasonable price and food going out from their kitchen fast.","Babi balah, sate samcan, and sup babi were all very good. They come in small portions, so one is probably not enough.","I like the place, so cozy and nice, specially to have local balinese dishes with friends. The location was not so difficult to find. The service was good and the staffs were kind and helpful.
The babi balah was delicious, specially for people that like spicy food. The pork soto (soup) was tasty and nice, only the samcan satay that was too fatty for me.
But overall it was a great food for dinner."

The first is that the room is spacious with a toilet inside... Then We can sing to our heart's content by simply ordering a drink or food... Indeed, I admit that the prices for food and drinks here are expensive, but let's just say they break even because they don't set a specific amount that must be spent!!!","We were looking for a Karaoke Bar and google said this place. Certainly not the kind of Karaoke we were looking for, but we really enjoyed the experience. The song catalogue is huge. You purchase a room size (we got a free small room) and then purchase drinks and food. Unfortunately it seems you can only purchase spirits by the bottle so we stuck to soft drinks. There was quite a language barrier compared to other more touristy parts of Bali.","It was an amazing experience, it was first time for me and my friend. Sounds was working great, the room is absolutely clean, the staff were very friendly. I'll be back soon","BEWARE the copious security, they used it to scam an extra 2million IDR.
We paid up after a great night, bill all settled. The hostess‚Äôs kept opening stuff in the minibar so there were extra expenses, annoying but no biggie. Paid up, said thanks and were waved on our way.
We had delays getting a taxi and they suddenly surrounded us in security and said we didn‚Äôt pay the bill. No receipt this time, just lots of pointing at a price list completely different to the one they showed us at the beginning of the night and demands of an extra 2 million.
If you must go, take a photo of the price list so they can‚Äôt pull this fast one."

I can't speak for the food, but they definitely had a wide selection of drinks available.  If you're looking for a luxurious club experience, this might not be it. But if you want to experience Denpasar's nightlife with a local twist, then New Star Club is a great option!

I love the blue bike that share with us our experience during 10 days in Bali.

One part of their service that makes me so much pleasure is they can give you the bike at the airport and you can return it in anywhere that adjacent to Denpasar. This is a super nice service because you can save millions to travel by taxi from airport to hotel.

The mini kitchen is good, providing the convenience of preparing my meals whenever I wish.

The environment around the guest house is nothing short of delightful. Surrounded by lush greenery and well-maintained.

Safety is a top priority here, and I appreciate the presence of CCTV cameras that provide an added layer of security. It gives me peace of mind knowing that the management takes the safety of its residents seriously.

The bathroom in this place is fantastic! It boasts a well-designed layout, and I was impressed by how clean and well-maintained it was. Plus, the presence of a water heaterüôåüèº

Another perk that I truly value is the availability of a parking lot for bikes. It makes commuting a breeze for someone like me who relies on a bike for transportation. (Notes: they don't have a space for car)
