The location and the resort itself is absolutely breathtaking but what makes the experience even more incredible are the amazing staff. From the moment we arrived they made us feel so welcome, there was nothing they weren‚Äôt willing to do to make our stay incredible, and we absolutely fell in love with this place. Thank you for making our trip to Bali so special, we will be back!","This place is beautiful. The rooms are spacious. The view is breathtaking. The food at the restaurant is delicious. The staff is polite and friendly. It was my birthday and upon my arrival, there was a bath drawn with flower petals and ""Happy Birthday"" was spelled out on my bed in flower petals. Top tier! My only complaint is that it's located a little far from most attractions. However, I would stay here again if I returned to Bali.","This is one of the finest hotels in Ubud. The staff are courteous and kind, with good customer service. The restaurant is excellent, offering natural and homemade oils for massage. Our room has a private pool, which is perfect. The housekeeping was impeccable and all household items were checked. I must express my gratitude to all the staff at the hotel and the general manager for their outstanding services.","Such a peaceful and beautiful resort! We stayed here for the majority of our honeymoon in a private villa with pool and absolutely loved it.

Come for the view, rooms and pool and stay for the welcome tea and food.","If you want a tranquil and secluded resort with beautiful service..come here!
Don't expect hustle and bustle, its superchill resort.

It was both our birthdays and we recieved cake and flowers x2. They really spoiled us. The Kelusa resturant is really really nice and was actually one of the best meals I had in Bali. The chef really needs a big hug!

The sunrise yoga is a must! She has the most beautiful voice that she will serenade you with at the end.

The staff go above and beyond. They are super sweet. Big shout out to Luhne and Suta!

The only downside was that the spa was under reno and the gym had a slight mouldy smell. But the rooms has none of this and were better than some 5 star hotels I've stayed in. Hopefully they will renovate the whole downstairs and give it a lift and remove the mouldy smell.

Thank you
Somayyeh and Gulay"

Amazing restaurant, my wife and I had a memorable romantic dinner at The Kelusa.
Excellent food, incredibly welcoming staff‚Äîkind, polite, and always smiling, big up to Restu and Cynthia.
Top-notch service and refined, gourmet cuisine.
They offer to us the cocktails and a very smelly candle ü•∞
Highly recommend !","What a place !

In the middle of the rain forrest outside of Ubud this very special dining experience awaited us.

The place it self is awesome and has a spectacular view. We came for dinner and we had one of our best dinner in Bali here.

The food was perfectly made and very nicely put in the platter. The drinks were delicious (try the gin cocktail with the Vanille foam). We also had vegetarian food which was great.

It‚Äôs a bit more expensive but decent mit worth the money if you want to have a bit more exquisite dining experience.","This restaurant is situated in the jungle hights, with a great view of the green forest. From the entrance, you would be met by kind and attentive staff. During our meal, we tried the chef's dishes and it was amazing. The food presentation and taste were excellent. Just look at photos, it is so beautiful üòç. We enjoyed it very much. Romantic place, we had lunch here, I can imagine how wonderful it is in the evening! Should return ü•∞
This place has my biggest recommendation for a visit.","I stayed at the hotel, and generally wouldn't expect much from the ""hotel food."" But The Kelusa is different! Some of my favorite meals I've had in Bali were here. The rice Bowls, the poached pear to name a couple. I'm gluten free and never got sick. They took such good care of me! It's a beautiful jungle view and a bit off the beaten path, so it's quiet and peaceful. Some nights they have live music too!","This beautiful restaurant is part of the Samsara 5* hotel and has delicious food. We have been having breakfast here for 3 days now and the selection is vast enough to want us coming back + coffee is amazing. There is a really nice view over the rain forest and as most guests seem to order food to their rooms, there is always space available. The restaurant has a good selection of wine and we had a Californian bottle of 2018 white wine for about $60 which we thought was reasonable for the exclusivity of the location. Service is friendly and attentive."
