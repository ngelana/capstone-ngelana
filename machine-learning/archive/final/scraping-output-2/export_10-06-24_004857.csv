And road experience was another level. We took our rental scoopy up there, we made it carefully within 30min after Goa Lawah rest area. Preferable to take a much powerful motorbike if you want to go up or just find a 4x4 since the road is slippery. You can see mountains from here. A very nice place to camp and chill. Since they did not charge any fee yet, nobody took care of the place, a lot of small2 rubbish leftover.

You can come by riding motorcycle to this spot but will be little bit difficult because rocking road..","Bukit Tengah has majestic scenery and panorama! You can enjoy both blue sea and hilly valley from this spot. If you are a sunset or sunrise hunter, this place is suitable for you.
This location can be accessed by motorcycle. There is a sign to this place roughly about 500 m after the Goa Lawah Temple (If you depart from Denpasar). From the main road, you will encounter ascending and winding road that takes about 15 minutes to pass. The signs that spread at the road will lead you to this hill. After no longer road you can travel by motorcycle, It means you are almost there.
Until the day I post this review, this place haven't had sufficient parking area yet and there is no entrance fee too. You can park your vehicle on the side of the road near the location. From the parking spot, you have to take a walk for about 5 minutes prior to reach the location. As you take the path you will meet green grass with several trees few and far between. You will actually reach the location if you see a traditional building (Joglo).
From this location you can see the Badung strait that separate Bali Island with Nusa Penida Island. You are also able to monitor the ship traffic from Padang Bai Port to the Lombok Island from here. Apart from the sea view, this place also serves mermerizing green undulating valley. Mount Agung (the highest Mount in Bali) can be clearly observed from here. The earth-sculpture-resembling hilly valley view is the best background you can take for your portrait! Futhermore, this place is perfect place for contemplating while enjoying the fascinating scenery.
Ps
Be aware that you walk too close to the edge as you may be slipped to the steep slope.
Since this place is newly pristine and there's no rubbish bin nearby, you must keep this place remains clean!","The best peaceful and tranquility getaway ever!
There's no crowded people and you will find the beauty scenery!
Green-wonderland, beautiful ocean, fresh air.
Not suitable for rainy season.
Best spot for catching sunrise, mystical scenery and lay on the ground.
Located near Goa Lawah Attraction, not many tourist come over here because not really popular.
This hidden germ, little bit far away from the main street and not good condition for the pathway.
But it is worth to visit.
Bukit Tengah like its name (Tengah = middle), this  is located between sea and hills.
You can build a tend here but don't forget clean up everything before you leave this area. Don't throw away your rubbish.
Keep exploring and stay too keep our earth clean!"
