But maybe with more people so we can dance together then hehehe... I like the ambience. With some fire shows from some dancers.,"We came for Salsa night event, which was amazing! However, despite receiving confirmation of our reservation through WhatsApp, there was a miscommunication when we arrived. Initially, they placed us on the second floor facing the stage, but we had requested a different table in front of the stage on the first floor. After some arguing, we were eventually seated at the table we had requested. While we appreciated being accommodated, we wished that we didn't have to argue for a reservation that had been confirmed beforehand.

At first, we didn't have high expectations for the food, but it turned out to be quite good. The service was okay, but they could use more staff to provide better assistance and avoid having customers wave their hands multiple times to get their attention.","Good vibes, excellent ambience, exceptional dj and they also got cool dancers on Thursday!!!

We were particularly drawn to its entirely plant-based menu, reviews, and ambiance. It‚Äôs quite normal and acceptable for the restaurant to be full and to wait in line at the entrance.

Compared to the restaurant‚Äôs busyness, there are few service staff; all of whom work tirelessly but struggle to keep up with customers.

The variety on the menu is genuinely intriguing. Salads, pizzas, breakfast options, and especially the desserts are appetizing.

It‚Äôs impossible to find such a vast array of vegan pizza options elsewhere.

However, the taste of the food was below our expectations. They were somewhat hard to digest and heavy.

The restaurant‚Äôs warm climate conditions and inadequate ventilation system also made dining and enjoying a meal difficult.

The menu prices were quite reasonable.

Despite its lovely location and concept, I cannot give Alchemy full marks due to the food‚Äôs taste and the insufficient ventilation system.","We went to Alchemy with high expectations. The design and atmosphere look amazing. The dishes seem great for plant-based eaters. However, I can't say the same for the taste. Yes, it's a paradise entirely made up of vegan options, but we couldn't finish any of the four options we ordered. Also, you should know that you might have to wait in line for at least 10 minutes when you go. The air conditioning, etc., were not sufficient; it was quite hot. Crowded.","This place is amazing. Probably one of the best vegan restaurants I‚Äôve been to. We got the Greek pizza and it was delicious. The only issue was the coconut mozzarella was a weird texture, quite gooey and jelly-like. Otherwise it was amazing!","Beautifully plated food in a peaceful and welcoming environment, where you can find a co-working space, a gift shop and yoga classes. Besides the fixed menu, they offer different lunch options everyday that look delicious. An amazing spot overall","I love Alchemy ! I've pretty much eaten everything here multiple times living in Bali. The salad bar is so incredible, it's definitely one of the best salad bars in the world ! So much variety and delicious things and all vegan....I absolutely love the raw spinach mushroom pizza, the passion fruit cheesecake, acai bowl, mushroom soup and the green waffles! I'm not crazy about the  gluten free cooked pizza or quiche and I personally don't order juices as they are not freshly made. Of course some things are a miss sometimes.
However I've eaten here a million times and highly recommend most of the dishes here, it's a gem."

We got seated right away and ordered drinks, eventually food. The litchi martini is out of this world and I also enjoyed the lemon marinated chicken. The service was wonderful and the atmosphere was nice as well - the only downside of the atmosphere was that the music from the next door club and the music from the restaurant were combining and it was quite agitating.","-Good place to chill and dine
-Nice ambiance and lighting
-Good food choices
-Some staff were nice and some were just quite rude and un-entertaining at all.
-Some staff really act and move so lousy, it gives you the feeling that you're not really that welcome to dine into this restaurant knowing that they're quite expensive restaurant.

I went to try this restaurant because I am craving for some good steak for dinner, I was expecting for a great service all through out my dine-in experience here because this is quite a popular place to dine around the area but unfortunately I don't feel so comfortable in this restaurant because some of their staff looks at you as if I don't have money to pay for my steak. I am Asian looking but most definitely I have money to pay for my steak even I eat it everyday in my life.  Just for your information staff.

Management, please do educate your staff about proper service to all colors and races, have some decency. This is not good for your business's reputation.","Lovely spot for brunch/ lunch.
I had the steak and eggs which I would recommend highly.
Coffee took a while to be taken to the table. Got my coffee at the same time as my meal - which I thought was a tad odd.
Lovely atmosphere and staff were friendly.","Nestled in the chic quarters of Uluwatu, Ours captures the essence of a refined dining experience with its cozy and welcoming setting. Our visit was made more pleasant by the courteous and positive attitude of the staff, particularly our waiter, who greeted us with a smile.

However, our dining experience took an unexpected turn. As a family traveling with a one-year-old, we appreciate restaurants that accommodate the little ones. While the adult menu boasted some impressive options, particularly a notable beef dish, our request for a simple meal for our toddler became a challenge. We initially requested a basic grilled chicken breast and vegetables, only to be informed after a wait that it wasn't available unseasoned. We then opted for fish, yet after another lengthy wait, we were met with the same response.

This experience raised concerns about the freshness and flexibility of the kitchen. In an era where culinary adaptability is often a hallmark of quality, the inability to grill a simple chicken or fish dish for a baby seemed incongruent with the otherwise high standards of the restaurant.

While the ambiance and initial service at Ours are commendable, the limited flexibility in catering to straightforward, fresh meal requests was a notable downside of our visit."

This restaurant is kind of unique in that it allows you to create your own meal. You can also order items from the menu.

My wife and I chose to create our own meals and I feel I should have opted for an a la carte option.

For me, the different options available from which we can choose didn't really go together. I chose prawns as my non-vegetarian option which I also didn't really like.

Overall, maybe it was a me problem as my wife did enjoy the meal she created. But I wasn't a fan."

The nourish power salad was good but the dish was a bit too small, considering its price. The pizza was fresh & fine overall, but definitely not the best pizza I had in Uluwatu.
The glow juice was definitely the highlight of the meal - tasty and creamy.

The best part of this cafe is actually its store, it has a variety of special produce - we bought their amazing home made crackers (super recommend the salt & pepper ones!!)",Nice place for a big choice of food. A little expensive and I had to wave the waiter down to get him to take my order. But food was tasty and brought out within a decent time.,"The breakfast was good, really lovely hash browns and egg, however the baked beans were definitely different to those in the Uk. I swapped out the mushrooms and avocado for the beans, and they were more of a smashed kidney bean so personally wouldn‚Äôt recommend. Although they did let me know this before, therefore a decent breakfast as a whole.","Nourish Cafe & Pizzeria, with two enchanting locations on The Bukit that redefine the art of nourishment. From the vibrant streets of Bingin to the serene oasis of the second location, immerse yourself in a world where every bite tells a story of organic, locally-sourced goodness.

As the sun casts its golden glow over the lush surroundings, Nourish Cafe beckons with promises of vibrant flavors and nourishing delights. Step inside the Bingin location, where a whole food shop stands in harmony with the cafe, offering a cornucopia of fresh goods that whisper tales of the land. Take a piece of this culinary haven back to your villa and let the essence of Nourish linger long after your visit.

Indulge in the culinary masterpieces that grace their menu - from crisp, refreshing salads to vibrant superfood bowls that burst with vitality. But the true star of the show? Their wood-fired pizzas, crafted with love and care, each bite a symphony of flavors that dance on your taste buds, transporting you to a realm of culinary bliss.

Nourish is not just a cafe; it's a sanctuary, a haven of light and greenery that envelopes you in its warm embrace. The air is alive with laughter and chatter, a symphony of happy souls coming together to bask in the joy of good food and great company.

While the culinary offerings shine bright, the cocktail drinks at Nourish may leave a bit to be desired. The margarita, though refreshing, falls short with a watery note, and the wine list can sometimes run dry. However, let not these minor hiccups deter you from the grand feast that awaits, for the true magic of Nourish lies in the wholesome, hearty fare that fills your soul with contentment.

PS while the entertainment is good but can be a bit noisy.","An amazing cafe with a wide range of vegetarian and vegan options. Absolutely loved the vegan morning glory, the coffee hit the spot as well! A very nice modern atmosphere inside and good staff! 5 out of 5 for me. Suksema!"

The juices though were delicious and super refreshing! We tried the Antioxidant and the Melonade and couldn't decide which one we liked better.","Choosing a chilled breakfast place in Uluwatu area is always challenging only because there are lots to choose from. The Loft was perfect for us for the following reasons:
PLACE - spacious, homey feel, high ceilings, and minimal echo of chatters during the busy morning
SERVICE - as soon as you sit down, a bottle of water, menu and a smile were given by the wait staff, any waitstaff knew what they are selling, not many were lingering around talking to each other, always ready to serve you
FOOD - great choice of savoury classics (i had the salmon r√∂sti and my partner had shaksouka), sweet options, and smoothie bowls which you see across all cafes in the island. Had pain au chocolat which was also amazing.
BEVERAGE - simple yet great choices of fresh healthy mixed juices (recommend the basil ginger lime and green juice), the coffee was smooth and of course using local blend of Bali Kintamani and Aceh Gayo. When in Bali why brew imported beans when you have the best ones sourced locally?
ATMOSPHERE - the vibe is less pretentious unlike other cafes in the area, chilled and relaxing, music was not too loud too, here you find a comfortable crowd as opposed to a ‚Äòi wanna look effortlessly good‚Äô crowd üò¨
MINOR FEEDBACK - Noticed that the pastry display chiller was tucked in the left hand corner of the bar by the wall, it may entice customers if it was more visible towards the center where current POS system is stationed. Love the pastry and sweet treats selection in that display!"

Highly recommend the pizza (thin base and crust), but ordered the spaghetti carbonara, which was on the dry side.

Salsa night on Tuesday was a vibe! Fun and casual night out overall. Would recommend!","I had high expectations before visiting this place because of the high rating on Google but I was one of the unlucky ones who had a bad and disappointing experience here.

1. Fried calamari - the sauce was good but calamari was tasteless (definitely below average).

2. Carbonara - the homemade spaghetti was really good but the bacons are way too salty which ruined the whole dish.

3. Order the most expensive item which is chef‚Äôs special ‚ÄúSteak with Garlic Prawn Cream Sauce‚Äù - read the description, ‚Äútopped with a flavoured tiger prawn‚Äù vs. what we received was 4 pieces of small prawns dipped in the cream sauce. 100% NOT true to picture and felt cheated. Immediately gave feedback to the service staff and later on the restaurant manager came with an explanation ‚Äúthis is the size of the tiger prawn because the head and tail was peeled off etc‚Äù‚Ä¶I mean common, just Google it, you will see why it‚Äôs called ‚Äútiger prawn‚Äù! She apologised but asked if I want to order something else on the menu. After having the calamari and pasta, I said NO. She left then came back with another explanation ‚Äúthe reason that your dish looked different is because you asked the sauce to be on the side‚Äù‚Ä¶ I replied ‚Äúbut I didn‚Äôt ask the prawn to be on the side and in the sauce?‚Äú I was really taken aback by her explanation and weak ground for arguing back! She again apologised and I felt that it was insincere. After sharing my thoughts about the calamari and pasta and told her that I‚Äôm gonna write an honest review on Google, her attitude changed. Quickly cleared my plates (I finished my food and she did ask me if she could clear) and walked off. No service recovery other than insisting that I should order something else. She even insisted that they have very good reviews and other customers are enjoying their food ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è oh well, I was just unlucky I guess??

To be fair, the service staffs are super welcoming, polite and patient! I have no complaints about the service and the atmosphere. But definitely not value for money, paying a premium price for food that is below average (overall experience).

Wish you all the best for being so sarcastic about people‚Äôs feedback and giving groundless arguments again and again! Pathetic behaviour!"

Unfortunately this place whilst it looks great, fancy fit out the coffee is sub-par and service lacks.

The only thing to complain is the music, doesn‚Äôt much at all with the place.
Lucky that we went end of January, so not many people around.",Amazing authentic indo cuisine. Nasi camputr and a coke for 50k is great value,"It serves buffet style where we can choose the side dishes from the available dishes. We can also order a la carte. The concept is really nice, if the food is warm. However, all of the food were cold. Even the a la carte was not really warm. They should have at least microwave it before serving it.

I could not finish the food, it was like a torture finishing the food. The drinks are fine.","The food is delicious, extremely well priced & the overall atmosphere is divine! It‚Äôs definitely a more relaxing spot with a nice view."

- Gym is small
- You need to pay for the spa
- Bathroom roof is open. So bugs keep coming into the bathroom.

Pros
- Spacious coworking space(Free!)
- Beautiful gardern
- Barber shop
- Location is accessible to restaurants nearby

Overall
- Wonderful coworking space. They even have a monitor that you can use for free.","Me and my partner came across this restaurant as we were looking for restaurants around, the place is very cozy, the food quality and quantity is perfect and the price also affordable compare to some other restaurants around, and not to mention the service‚Ä¶ the staffs are very polite and friendly, overall 10/10.

Highly recommended!","We had breakfast here two times. Food is delicious and nicely served, stuff members  are very kind and well trained. The restaurant has a romantic atmosphere, we really recommend it and will come back again.",We came for breakfast on Xmas eve and wondered why it was so empty! Lovely establishment with well trained staff. Was expecting the usual cafe quality food but was pleasantly surprised by how flavourful the dishes were! The lovely bright and airy indoor seating options are great for couples or small groups. The coffees are served exactly how I like them (slightly on the hotter side) make sure you give this place a try if you‚Äôre in the Uluwati area. Open all day!,I went for lunch today and I ordered ceviche and pasta with octopus.To be honest I was really disappointed about the food. It was just average. Before I come my expectation was really high as I saw there was a lot of good reviews of it. But the octopuses was not fresh they used a lot of sauce to cover the flavour of the  octopus. It‚Äôs definitely not worth of the money.,Had a beautiful dinner here with friends. The Possion Cru and the Lucky Peach were both some of the nicest dishes I have had in restaurants recently. The staff were friendly and helpful. Fabulous place to eat!

Was able to cancel a surfing lesson due to bad conditions without a problem.
Probably a bit pricey, but as we we‚Äôre spontaneous we were happy to find a reasonable place to stay in Uluwatu.","Great location surf camp in Uluwatu.
We had a lovely room, clean and nice bathroom. Lots of natural light and rainforest/ garden view.
We got picked up from airport by a driver (for fee) and dropped right to the camp.
Some kittens there super cute. Really cool decor and colour scheme.
No safe or locked cupboard in rooms so leave belongings locked in bags.
Nice pool and cafe area.
2 small bottle water in room.
No warm or hot water in shower.
Air con worked well.
Staff reasonably nice.","Room smelled AWFUL, in addition of the room smelling bad the bathroom smelled like pee. There was a big lack of natural light as well in the room. It is well placed and it does look nice, especially with the pool and all. As other pointed it, there was no proper storage with lock either. It really wasn't worth it, I don't even have pictures to show how it was because I was so annoyed of the room.","Room and place was not as expected.

Firstly were charged more than the cost of the room 350+k for a small stain on the bed sheets and unreasonably demanded cash otherwise they would call the police. This stain policy was unclearly written in small fine print rather than explicitly explained, as the sheets must be kept immaculate such that people wouldn't have used them. Albeit the room itself was dirty and unclean with many bugs in the bathroom area, and labelling as a surf camp but not expecting fair use.

Poor standard of stay with construction and work on rooms still ongoing, smaller and cramped pool then pictured, lack of privacy in the way the rooms are setup so others can see in, difficulty to lock the doors to rooms, and continuous loud music through the night from neighbouring night venues and bars!

The staff outside who help with parking the scooters were very friendly and nice, unlike the ladies who worked behind the reception, they were rude and unhelpful.

Wouldn't recommend to a friend, better stay somewhere else!",This is difficult for me to write as the staff in this Bombora surf camp is great but folks out there. Be careful they unnecessarily charged me for the duvet cover stain. This is not done by me and they claimed it was. This change was more than the two night stay.

They have a very cool atmosphere, all the guys are very friendly, positive, polite and always ready to help you choose the right board that suits your level of riding.

I bought a surfboard from them a year ago, and some time later I came to them with a friend, who also bought a magic board there. Very often I come there to look at new collections, buy something for a surfboard and always enjoy the wonderful atmosphere there, which charges you for the whole day.

I don‚Äôt understand the negative reviews here about the store, because this is 100% not true. People are just jealous of something. It should be 5 stars only! Very recommend this place! Your magic board is waiting for you there!","The shop, while visually appealing with its extensive range of items, left much to be desired in terms of customer service. The employees, preoccupied with their selfies ü§≥, displayed a blatant disregard and disdain towards me, the only customer present. My visit was to purchase a leash, but the lack of professionalism and courtesy, especially from the cashier, made the experience unpleasant. This lack of attentive service gave the impression of a rudderless establishment, with no one effectively in charge. The overall atmosphere suggested that customer satisfaction was not a priority. üòï","The best surf shop in bali for sure, and one of the best surf shop I‚Äôve ever been in. I‚Äôm saying this not only because they have the best quality, but also because the serviced I received there, managed by Eddie, was  absolutely amazing. You buy a board, you also get a home for any support for any problem that may come up. Thanks","I ordered a custom board from White Monkey, thanks to the help of Eddie. He was knowledgeable and friendly. There was a bit of miscommunication in the beginning, but he went above and beyond to make sure I was happy and stoked on the board and their services. Can highly recommend them. Thanks again, Eddie! ü§ô","We agreed to meet at 7AM at the shop to go surfing. The instructor was 35 minutes late and didn‚Äôt let us know or answer his phone. When he finally got there, we went in the van and after a long time driving we ended up all the way on the other end of the peninsula. I thought we would just go to a beach nearby since didn‚Äôt receive any info (even though we asked for it), just that we would surf max 2 hours. I had to work that day, so I had to take a shorter lesson and take a taxi back myself. The surf lesson itself was good, but the lack of communication and the extra costs for a taxi all the way back made it a bad experience. Hope they can improve the information given before so that the expectations are clear üôè"

I've tried their breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and they've got a bunch of options, from vegan to Western and Asian dishes, ALL TASTY. OMG!!!  Despite trying all their food, I must say my favorite is their Tuna Nicoise. It's technically a salad, but it's so much more than that, you know what I mean? And hey, they offer free flow water for drinking. Yay!

What I love most is their chill garden area. It's just so relaxing to hang out there. The owner, Pak Made, and all the staff are friendly and really take care of you. Their hospitality is truly exceptional!

Overall, Sugar Rock is one of the best spots in Uluwatu. Whenever I'm around, I make sure to drop in for a meal. If you're in the area, definitely worth checking out!","Found this Restaurant from friend recommendation and satisfied with everything in here.

I loved the living area a perfect relaxing sunset spot , a huge swimming pool and a lot of attention to details!
We definitely will come back soon!","I recently stayed at the Uluwatu Sunset Villa with a group of friends enjoying a quiet weekend retreat. The villa itself is commendable ‚Äî well-equipped, spacious, and ideal for both a quiet getaway or a family trip. The breathtaking views and serene setting create a tranquil atmosphere, enhanced by stunning sunsets and a refreshing cool breeze off the ocean. However, the persistent construction noise, an unwelcome daily companion even on Sundays, marred the otherwise idyllic setting. Uluwatu Sunset Villa, though enchanting, is regrettably shadowed by this audible disturbance, which is a shame, hence the 4 stars and not 5."

They message us with a time the day before your booking, and when you get there, u can leave your scooter at the camp. They will take you to the surfing area.
