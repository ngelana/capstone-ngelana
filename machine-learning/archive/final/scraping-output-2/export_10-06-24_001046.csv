The place was immaculately clean, and the amenities provided added extra comfort to my overnight stay. The host was incredibly hospitable, making me feel welcomed from the moment I arrived. Overall, it was a delightful experience, and I would definitely choose to stay here again in the future","Absolutely stunning villa. Dede and his staff were attuned to our every need, offering to help transport us from our port arrival, helping us secure a motorbike, and even a delicious local Balinese wine. The place is fully equipped for your every need and the staff ensured a peaceful getaway away from the bustle of the city. We couldn’t have been happier with every single aspect of the stay! We can’t stress enough how much we recommend this place.","Here is the translation:

A truly exotic place, Very remote and truly captivating. It was the first time I stayed in a place like this And it was an amazing exotic experience. Thank you, If I have time again I will definitely visit this place.","It was a perfect place for my annual couple meeting and retreat. It is well located in the center of bali. So, i can escape from the hot weather in the coast and the cold mountain area. It is located in the village area, so tranquil and zen but i am not isolated from the outside world either. There are many local store to buy some snack but the nearest convenience store is around 2km away.

The villa is sooo cute and comfortable. We took many photos to complete our 2023 photo book. Large private garden, outdoor bath, and nice gazebo are perfect to have quality time with your partner. The kitchen is well funcional except the exhaust in my room is not working.

The staff is coming everyday to clean the room and the garden. Regardless, you still can expect many bugs as they are a part of the nature.

I am recommended this place and look forward to stay here again (maybe trying another villa).","Really nice villa around bangli area. The ambiance arround the villa is beautiful vegetation, also they have a bath tub outside the building arround the vegetation.
The host and helper is so nice. They also provide some cookware if you want to cook yourself. Definitely will come back when i'm arround bangli area, also it worth the price."

Donation at the entrance... We were the only ones there... A bit of a walk down (5-10min) and 50 meters in the caves/canyon but worthy... A sense of adventure...
They give you a stick for the walk...",Absolutely gorgeous!  No one was there which is amazing and I was able to enjoy the beauty in peace.  Easy access and a nicely maintained path to the waterfall.  I will definitely go here again to enjoy the beauty of the temple!,"We were very lucky to find this place that opened just 2 months ago. Very well maintained, it’s quite easily accessible although the road can be considered a bit rough. It’s nothing too scary though. The path is very nicely maintained, the host - Ketut - has done a great job making this waterfall accessible. He has a very kind heart and is very helpful and open. We had a lovely conversation with him :) The waterfall is absolutely fantastic. There were no people so we explored the caves and ravines all by ourselves. It’s definitely worth the price (20k pp). A walk to the river and first waterfall (there are at least 4) takes just 5 minutes :) Absolutely recommend!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",Amazing experience! Highly recommend. The hill down is a bit slippery but they can provide a bamboo stick. The canyon walk to the 2 waterfalls was so beautiful.,"An incredible place, now for me one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Bali. It’s somewhat similar to Tukad Chepung, but more original and not at all touristy. I was there on Sunday all alone. You need to make your way to it along the bottom of the canyon and this is an incredibly beautiful path, and the waterfall itself is like the cherry on the cake. A must visit before it becomes a tourist mecca)"
