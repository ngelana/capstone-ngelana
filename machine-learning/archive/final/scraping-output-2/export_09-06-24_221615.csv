Lovely Hospitable Indonesian Couple","A road side eatery with seating looking over the main road and more seating in a garden setting out the back where we ate. Extremely welcoming family run business. Menu is only in Indonesian, but the family all speak really excellent English. I knew from previous reviews to order the grilled fish and it was the first thing we were offered, spicy or not spicy. We were also offered calamari, but we knew our order would be more than enough. The fish was cooked perfectly along with a huge plate of rice and beautiful onion sambal. My fish came with chilli, my partners came with an almost BBQ type sauce that was delicious. If you are in the North West area of Bali this is a MUST to visit. Some of the most simple and beautifully cooked food we have had in Bali. Thank you so much for welcoming us into your restaurant.
Two plates grilled fish, rice, sambal & sauce
IDR 55,000 per person
Two small Bingtang
IDR 30,000 per bottle","The best fried fish in Bali.
I had nasi goreng with fried fish and it was amazing.
I've lived in Bali for 10 years so far this is the Best ikan goreng I've ever had.

My fiance ordered ikan bakar and it was great.
No wonder why the food tasted because the owner told us he used to work as a chef in the hotel.
We are sad that we tried this place on our last day in menjangan.
Definitely we'll be back here again.","This is your typical Balinese Warung,  nothing glamorous or fancy, but the food is just delicious. It is essentially a fish dishes Warung.
Fish  is fresh from the daily catch.","Best streetfood seafood!
Affordable price, big portion , and totally delicious!! I ordered tauco fish for dinner and got back there again for the next day!"
