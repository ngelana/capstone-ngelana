Sukasada, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81161, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=15725998069066908960,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.5,192,,"great waterfall experience. 20k for foreigners, 10k for indonesians to enter ( a small family seems to be the gatekeepers). itâ€™s worth it, as the path in (bike/walk only) is paved albeit narrow. very easy to navigate compared to other waterfalls. walk down takes about 5 mins and can be steep but 90% of it is carved stone steps; clearly a lot of quality work has gone in to make the fall accessible. walking back up surprisingly easy. at the fall the water is cold and clear and very clean. the pool before the falls is relatively deep. pretty clean down there and rocks not slippery. best waterfall in the area considering east of access. enjoy!","The place has potential. I asked the keeper if they have plans, he expected to finish his plan in two years.

I hope that in two years time the minus point that I found is fixed. The amount of trash. Distracts from the view.

Plus points are the fauna (butterflies/colourful dragonflies/quite big lizards 20cm and 30cm...). But with this also comes mosquitoes, so wear anti-mosquito spray.

You can't really swim there because the current is quite strong at some parts. But you can use the rock formation to hop and get slightly closer to the waterfall.

There is an entrance fee of 10.000 domestic/20.000 foreign. Perhaps that will change in the future.","Nice little waterfall. Little bit hard to find. Google maps not accurate. Easy way is to load in Gang Cengkeh on maps. It's off main road. Small lane for bikes. No car access.About 800m to falls. Walk down lane, pay 20k to ticket man. Walk on path thru ricefields to steps down to river. Cool walk up riverbed to falls. I was there by myself, like a lot of others. No tourists which made my day.","Liked that there were nobody. Waterfall is small but with large alleys. I was swimming there but couldnt enjoy it so much as in others waterfalls. 20k entrance, enter from the street in other comments, parking after entrance.","It was a lot of fun to visit this waterfall. With a scooter you can get much closer (extra 10 min walk if you are with car). Difficult to find, but okay with good navigation.

A trilling hike after some steep stairs makes it a lot of fun if you like adventures. It is not extremely difficult, but if you are not fit it might be a little challenging. We went at around 11 am, and there was good lighting on the beautiful waterfall.
Would definately recommend, more fun than the gitgit waterfall nearby (no 100 tourist shops and no entrance fee here). We had the waterfall all for ourselves."
