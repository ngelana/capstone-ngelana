Very divine. Peaceful and also has an unbelievable view. The hike is like 20 mins at least but it is totally worth it. Almost no one was present except the caretaker. I spent more than a couple of hours, flying my drone, meditating at complete peace. Will come back again someday. The place has a lot of uplifting energy","A must see around Candidasa! But BE PREPARED. It is NOT a walk in the park. A lot of reviews mention a 45min hike but that is I think for regular hikers. Ours took longer and we saw quite a few people returning earlier and not made it to the top. Also a bit of a letdown was the condition of the temple, not like so many other temples in Bali. But the views were magnificent!!","Great hike and beautiful view from the temple. We were alone at the temple in the morning, just some 3 local boys which put offerings at the way up. Realy a lot of monkeys on the way, at least 50-100 üôàüêí At the bottom you get a sarong for rent 20k and a blesing for going up the temple, realy beautiful üôÇ","This experience was cheap at only 10,000 IDR ($1 AUD) to enter. It was an amazing hike up to the top, which we were not expecting. You will need to wear a sarong, and they hire them at street level for 10,000 ($1 AUD) but I recommend taking it off for the hike as it is HOT and sweaty otherwise. Over 700 stairs to climb along with rough patches so this is not for the faint of heart. You do get to see plenty of monkeys along the way, but if you are not fit, it will be a case of ""are we there yet"" along the way. But, once you arrive at the top, the views are simply amazing, and it feels tranquil and satisfying. It is a great place to sit and meditate and ponder life. Be careful of the Monkeys at the top as we were almost attacked by one of the larger males!! The trip back down was much easier. üòâ","Must see! Amazing hike to the top and an outstanding view! Carry enough water, snacks and a own sarong. That give you something unique as memory and you will definitely use it again in Bali. The hike takes around 45 mins and the steps are just the roots of the trees. Before arriving at the top make sure to close the backpack regarding to the monkeys who gathering there."
