I have been buying Nasi Campur (mixed rice) for the past 14 years and it always delightful. Nothing fancy, just steamed rice, fish of chicken (depending on that she has cooked that morning) green vegetables, Tempe, Tofu and some sambal, if you like it hot. It comes either in a waxed paper cone or sometimes a banana leaf. Ibu Nur is usually sold out by 1300, so if you are looking for a quick lunch or later dinner, get there between 1100 and 1230! It refrigerates very well and heats up in a microwave in about 2 minutes!! Well worth the Rp 10,000.... It has been my nightly meal for all these many past years. Ibu Nur is a very pleasant woman and tolerates broken Bahasa Indonesia well....",,,,
