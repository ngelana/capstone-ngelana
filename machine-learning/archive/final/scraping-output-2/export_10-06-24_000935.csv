We recently stayed at Bali Eco Stay and it was INCREDIBLE. Exceeded our expectations. The communication was incredible from Johnny & Agung. Mini was so wonderful at helping us with EVERYTHING during our stay. The rooms were beautiful, the venue was stunning. Jungle paradise. Permaculture gardens. Fresh delicious food. Special shoutout to Indra & Arni in the kitchen for our special cooking workshops and ceremony. We will come here time and time again. Thanks guys.","Very adventurous stay with snakes, big spiders, scorpions and bats as roomies ;)
Gorgeous location and waterfalls.
The restaurant does their best to provide food that fits your eating schedule and diet with the resources they have from the garden.

Useful tip: you don‚Äôt even need to pack shampoo and soap, since they provide natural ones wich they kindly ask you use since all other soaps contain chemicals that will sabotage their water system","This is truly one of the most magical places to stay in Bali.

The resort is founded on permaculture principles and is sympathetic to everything from the way food is grown to the treatment of the local villagers

The bungalows are secluded and pristine.

The surrounding area is beautiful and is all fed by an underground spring

There are two waterfalls on the property and some amazing walks

The food is also exceptional and breakfast is included with the bungalows

As somewhere to escape Bali‚Äôs craziness and just rest and reflect there is nowhere better.

I could stay here and never leave","Wow, what a beautiful experience my fianc√© and I shared at Bali Eco Stay! There simply isn‚Äôt the words to encapsulate the wholeness of our time there, other than to say time itself seemed more full, more abundant with life and verve. Paradoxically so, as there is such calm and stillness here, even the mosquitoes aren‚Äôt intrusive. Every interaction from driver to reception, cooks and waitstaff to gardeners, the cleaners and right up to Johnny the owner; every little conversation, query or request was met with gentle and warm energy.
The setting is stunning, nestled in the mountains. The spring-fed creek means you are able to drink the shower water, in Bali! The food they grow and serve at the restaurant wasn‚Äôt just the best we had in Bali, but some of the best I‚Äôve had anywhere. It was like being cooked for by your mum and grandma, there was so much love in the food it was effervescent.
Four days felt like a week, and we are without a doubt returning to this special, special place.
I was ready to write off Bali as I‚Äôd only seen what had happened to the populated areas, but this has thankfully restored my faith in the destination and the potential for high-vibrational experiences still out there.

Thank you to everyone at Bali Eco Stay, we are so grateful for our time there, and eagerly anticipate our next visit.

Kids loved the kite making activity. Will definitely go back."

We visit on a rainy day and we could still safely access it. There are stairwell. The whole place is lush and quiet. I'd sit there with a coffee and a book if I could,"Very good Waterfall, we loved it. We parked our motorbike kinda far from the waterfall so we could walk a little bit to get there, we enjoyed the view during our walk. Clean, and nice. There is no entrance fee.. I would recommend you to take a walk as well...","This beautiful waterfall offers more than just a refreshing swim and picturesque picnics. There's a charming little warung and cabin available for changing, plus a scenic path winding through rice fields, adding extra charm to your visit.","My favourite place to go and redeemed myself. Surrounded by nature. Not accessible with car (you have to walk like 10 minutes), or just go with motorbike, there's parking area and small restaurant. And few bathrooms (very clean) for cleaning yourself after swimming. Love it!","Quite place ,Clean water,Clean place . And nice people in the local market there and free entrance ticket"

Perfect for a serene getaway surrounded by nature.

The food is delicious, of excellent quality, and offers great value for the price. However, there were a couple of minor hiccups; we were disappointed to find that the dessert we wanted was sold out, and there was a delay in receiving our cappuccino due to the absence of the barista. Nonetheless, overall, it was a positive experience.","THE BEST VIEW

May be when visit you one more times all will be more I get there","When on weekday afternoon for lunch and maybe due to the festival season, many other visitors around. There was a mandatory cover charge of Rp50K, which can be spent at the restaurant or bar. We tried torch ginger flower chicken (Ayam Kecombrang) and stewed chicken Manado Style. We also ordered Long Black and Lychee Mocktail. The coffee is good and so was Ayam Kecombrang. The restaurant was using western style soup plate for the rice and chicken, so it was a tad crowded. Lychee mocktail was too sweet for my liking, but refreshing nevertheless. The only upmarket place nearby, will go again.",TOPüèùÔ∏èüëë Best food and facility in this area.
