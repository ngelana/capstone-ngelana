ChIJhah5DLo90i0R8RBf-RBPUtQ,Woywoy Escape Samu,-8.5430718,115.2426561,"Banjar, Jl. Raya Samu, Singapadu Kaler, Kecamatan Ubud, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80361, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=15299377818452824305,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-1098-3429,resort_hotel,"resort_hotel, hotel, lodging",4.7,96,,"It‚Äôs a really good choice. It‚Äôs value for money. The room was clean and spacious. The staff was friendly (we had a problem with a tour that we booked and they were really kind and helped us). The location is a little bit far from the Center but the view is amazing. I would come
Back and stay here again for sure and recommend it to my friends. We had a great stay. The only thing that needs improvement is the breakfast that is below the average (and as the Center of Ubud to have breakfast is almost 20‚Äô by bike is it necessary to have a nice breakfast in the room to start your day!)","Guys a must stay with woywoy escape. It was a peace stay. They only serve breakfast which is just perfect and made sure that the vegetarian option is available. Their coordination,nature,politeness was just perfect. The rooms are just wow with private swimming pool and jacuzzi. Will give an overall rating for all as 5/5","Overall the idea is good with a beautiful location. Unfortunately the English of the service people is poor. My girlfriend and I had fallen sick, and we needed help to find a doctor/hospital. This was when we needed support and unfortunately they failed to deliver. They also have reusable bottles of water. To feel safe, I think using sealed bottled water is needed.","Woy Woy Escape Samu was even more beautiful in real life than it was in the photos. Don't hesitate to book here. My favourite feature was the private pool. The high walls means that you cannot see other guests, which provides complete privacy.  The staff are also incredibly helpful and kind. Every time I had a small request, the staff responded via phone within a few minutes and with great professionalism. To get to Ubud central, you can either hire a motobike or do what I did, which is to use Gojek/Grab. A Gojek car into the city is only 50,000 IDR (much cheaper still if you order a Gojek motobike). While it is a 20 minute drive into Ubud central, the peace and tranquillity found at Woy Woy is absolutely worth the short drive. The view of the rice fields, palm trees and wildlife (mostly birds that fly above the fields) is stunning -- particularly in the morning and evening light. When I come back to Bali, I will be staying here again. Highly recommended.","I recently had the pleasure of staying at this place, and it truly exceeded all expectations. Nestled amidst lush rice fields, the breathtaking views of nature from every corner are nothing short of mesmerizing.  The staff goes above and beyond to ensure your every need is met, and their genuine friendliness creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere ü§©ü§© i promise, i'll back soon!!"
