It‚Äôs spacious and air conditioned. Service is top notch and ambience so cozy I spent an entire day working here. And returned the next day as well.

The food is delicious. You couldn‚Äôt go wrong with your choice.
Grilled chicken salad is spectacular ü§åüèª
And teas are good too. The stress buster one is truly calming.
Be sure to try the gelato outside.","Exactly what I was craving, a perfectly steamed flat white with a decadent chocolate cake.  The atmosphere is nice, their menu is extensive and there is something for everyone in your group. They open long hours and their air conditioned space is perfect for working . Calm music, plenty of pastries, and outside seating option. They also have gelato options.","Slightly out of the main Ubud town centre

The place is a nicely decorated restaurant with good enough vibes.

Food served was to a high standard‚Ä¶ but of course you pay for the quality. We had our fill of choices and that‚Äôs barely touching any of their breakfast fare, since we came for dinner.

The coffee plus croissant set is a good deal, cuz taken individually it‚Äôs way costlier. Plus the butter croissant was on point. I can say their other pastry will be great too‚Ä¶

Drinks were good, alas they don‚Äôt provide any complimentary water. Milk shakes aren‚Äôt the thick kind made of ice cream, it‚Äôs more of blended with ice & milk variety, so it wasn‚Äôt  very thick.

Ice cream served outside in their partner shops wasn‚Äôt too bad with the bun and choux option a good one.

Overall a worthy drop in whilst you are in Ubud.","This is a hidden gem. We googled best place for breakfast in Ubud and this popped up. 6min wall too. Atmosphere, food and staff are all amazing. It‚Äôs a great little find. Danish/ cakes are Devine"

I booked a bed in the 10 beds dorm. When I arrived, I saw small dark stains on the sheets. I removed the fitted sheet to check the mat and directly saw 3 bedbugs !!
I returned to the reception to complain, but the receptionist was very stoic, no chocked at all. He just offered me to go in another bed, but since I realized he would not do anything against the problem and just give my bed to someone else, I just left the place and found another one, more clean.
I have to recognize the place is really beautiful and the workers really kind. They refund me, apologized and let me spend hours in the garden, all the time needed to find another last minute accomodation.
But definitively I can't recommand this place...","The hostel was a really nice vibe and the outdoor pool was lovely. Unfortunately I found three bed bugs on my bed/curtain in the dorm room so I left the hostel. The lady at reception handled it really well and gave me a full refund. If I‚Äôd of seen a review that someone else had experienced this then I would have avoided this place. Hoping to save someone the same trouble I went through, was a shame.","Lovely place with an amazing pool and a very friendly and helpful staff ! Everything is clean.

More storage would be really appreciated in the rooms as it‚Äôs quickly a mess with everyone‚Äôs bag
But over that I really recommend this beautiful peaceful place","The pictures of this property are great. It's tucked away in a corner in the street with a small board so can be easily missed. The staff is good and helpful. The property is quite pretty with green lush lounging areas and two pools. However, the dorm rooms are not cleaned daily - I stayed for three nights or so and didn't see the room or my bed cleaned even once. Washroom is not clean also considering so many people are using it. Maintenance of basic facilities is not up to the mark. Location is way away from the main market in Ubud & it's a long walk inside the lane toonbut you get to see another side of Ubud. There's a lot of construction work around on the road. And there are a lot of barking dogs on that road. Overall I was disappointed by this place. It's not as good as it looks."

Tucked away in the serene landscapes of Bali, this small hotel offers a tranquil escape.

The rooms are equally impressive, providing comfort and a touch of Balinese elegance at a price that doesn't break the bank. But what truly sets this place apart is the service.

Everyone is cheerful and having around them and chatting them was nice. Also breakfast was so good!,"Literally the best hotel we stayed in during our two weeks in Bali.

The staff make this place even more wonderful - I've rarely seen people so kind and attentive. You feel like you're in a family.

The pool and room were very spacious and spotless, the location is just perfect as we were 6 minutes from everything, away from the noise and euphoria of the center. There's a wonderful view over the rice paddies and the hotel offers lots of services like scooter rental and activities at very reasonable prices, which is rarely the case in hotels here. I'll be coming back to Bali just to go back to this hotel, and I'm sorry I didn't stay longer. Their juices are the best I've ever had here. Many thanks to everyone for their warm welcome and all the help they gave us during our stay.
I'd also like to point out that the place is quiet, which is a real plus - you can enjoy the pool without having to fight for a deckchair.
Once again, a big thank you to the staff who made our stay so special, see you soon!","Great place!

My food however fell apart(3-4) while eating. I have a very gentle touch since I‚Äôm used to using chopsticks. I think nori was not wrapped well or maybe i made them overstuffed with veggiesüòÇ

I ordered sushi combo box & matcha parfait. It was not good quality, but amazing for the price.

Matcha parfait tasted more like green tea powder rather than authentic matcha powder (greener, has more amino acids). Even for culinary grade, it was too weak. So I was glad I had Ocha (Japanese green tea) as part of the combo set.

Highly recommend for anyone to travelling üòä",I love this place to eat sushi. All the foods I‚Äôve tried are wonderful. I‚Äôve been back more than 5 times and I intend to come back more often.

It‚Äôs a Japanese joint, if you couldn‚Äôt tell by its make: The only dish which was a lil off was the ramen‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think you can say it‚Äôs ramen‚Ä¶ lol‚Ä¶

The rolls were all tasty, and the fried rice dishes we took to share were all lovely.

Sashimi was also good. We didn‚Äôt take the salmon, due to an odd pricing difference. But the butterfish and red snapper were a steal! Tuna too‚Ä¶

The milkshake was surprisingly good, only small. And their cupping coconuts came imprinted with their restaurant logo‚Ä¶ a cool touch.

It was easy to escape the heat either in the pool or in the air-conditioned bedroom.
Breakfast was delicious. You were provided with several selections to pick from.

The only negative was that there wasnt much foliage/privacy between us and the lower villas, for example when using one end of the swimming pool. It looked like things had been recently pruned so maybe not an issue year round? But would be good to have a privacy screen at end of pool.

I arrived on my birthday was greeted with a beautiful cake and the staff sung happy birthday. It was incredibly sweet.

Room: We stayed in a room upstairs above the shared lounge / lobby. There are only two rooms upstairs with a more private lounge between the rooms giving you absolutely no neighbouring room. We made use of the both the front and back decks up here. Our room was large and both single beds were canopied together with a large net curtain at night. It gave it a fairy tale feel which we loved. There is a small mini bar with reasonably priced drinks and snacks. A stand alone water dispenser is included so we could refill our bottles and use it to brush our teeth. The bathroom is large and ours upstairs was 90% closed in with a roof. I think the villas below have open bathrooms. There is a turn down service; at night we would return with windows closed, net curtains down and room sprayed for any mossies. Extremely helpful.  Our room also provided sarongs for both the pool as well when you visit temples. It included typical toiletries as well as mosquito repellent and earplugs.
We did pay a bit more than the average rate per night but I absolutely loved staying here and would again.

Tip: walk about 400 metres up the road and on the left is a laundry service. 3kgs cost me $42k. Ready the next day.","If you are planning a trip to Ubud, stay here as you will not regret it.

Everything about this hotel was amazing. The staff, setting, rooms, facilities, food, location, free shuttle service into town (is still very walkable), & ease of booking anything you wanted to do whilst visiting Ubud can't be faulted.

A little oasis of calm in amongst the busy streets of Ubud.

Well worth every penny."

Make time to experience Made Tea. We took a group of 4 to do the tea making workshop, and we were SO impressed with Made and her team. She told us her story, took us on a garden tour, taught us about the herbs, and helped us make our own tea blend. We even had an array of little fresh made treats to eat and pair with our tea. We also got to take home fresh blends and seeds.
We loved it so much, we came back every day of the rest of our trip for breakfast or lunch. The food is so fresh and tasteful.

Must try their cold brew and pumpkin cake!

Reasons why I love Made Tea:
-unique educational experience
- beautiful property
- kind, knowledgeable, and passionate owner
- healing properties of tea
- professional and classy (everything is very aesthetic in an organic beautiful way)
- TASTY & FRESH food
- gift shop that sells their products
- honest hard working small business that I feel good about supporting

Thank you Made Teas, you were my favorite part about Bali!","A chill place where you can do tea meditation natrually surrounded by nature, friendly people, serene vibe.

When I visited I was the only one in the place. I loved the ambience more than I expected. Food, tea, service, everything was worth a visit üòä

Food I tried
- dumpling
- spring roll
- miso moringa noodle

Tea I tried
- rosella chai (refill provided, after I finished the first infusion, another one was offered with top-up).

Tips:
- WEAR CLOTHES. I find this place more windy and cooler than the central. I recommend bringing a cardigan or wear warmer than you would normally be in the central area. I was wearing a sleveless top. The upstair was too cold due to wind. I dined downstair that was warmer.

This place offers a variety of workshop, afternoon tea, etc.","The best tea experience you can have. The owner is one incredible woman that knows so much about the different herbs and all of their benefits. The workshop was absolutely wonderful and it is totally worth it, plus educates you for all of the tastes and their influence on your health.

Room was not really clean, dirt and hairs from previous visitors. The bathroom seemed ok but my second evening it started to smell so so extremely bad I nearly puked. I could not use it. Also the extractor that turned on with the light made a very very loud noise and it looked really dirty, absolute lack of maintenance.
There is a fountain in the ground level that just makes noise, it's not a nice sound of a water stream, it's a loud noise that goes on from early morning to late evening. For some reason, the restaurant plays from 8-9am to +10pm very loud repetitive western music with quite some base that goes into the rooms, it did wake me up on my second day there, and it does not help if you want to have an early night sleep. I see no sense in going to another country and being imposed loud low quality western hits, I find it a really unintelligent interpretation of what a person/visitor is looking for when on holiday in another country/culture. Even classical music at a reasonable volume with not so much base punch would be a much better idea, but really, music so loud as to get in the rooms you pay to rest, just makes no sense. I insist, staff is really nice but the problem I really consider it to be the management. One of the reasons the restaurant is empty is precisely that loud music that really does not invite to enjoy a meal there. Also, moving/pushing restaurant loud chairs and tables at 8-9am, with no pads under the legs does not help at all with sleeping.
I am taking the trouble to specify all this hoping that management takes this information into account and makes some changes that would hopefully improve the clients experience, its only for their own business good and success.
Please get rid of that loud music and turn off that bloody fountain üòÖ","I must say, my recent hotel stay was quite disappointing. Unfortunately, I encountered several issues that affected my overall experience. For starters, there were ants on the bed, and the bathroom was not in the best condition, with someone else's facial hair in the sink. The towel provided for feet was also unclean, which was not pleasant.

The noise from the main road was quite bothersome during the night, and the fact that my room had a locked door to another room, where I could hear everything from the neighboring guests, was a bit frustrating.

On top of that, I had a short stay, arriving late at 9 pm and departing at 7:30 am, which limited my ability to enjoy the included breakfast that started at 10 am. The hotel's pictures were misleading, as I booked a standard room with a double bed, but I ended up with a twin bed, and they couldn't accommodate my request for a change.

The bathroom's condition didn't match the photos either, and I've stayed in cleaner hostels before. The staff, on the other hand, were friendly and helpful, showcasing Indonesian hospitality.

Considering these issues, I don't think I'll be returning to this hotel, and I cannot wholeheartedly recommend it to others either.","room was good, ask for 1 large bed,instead got 2  single beds, but no problem. The staff was nice. Didnt try the food. Located next to alfamart so it was easy to get supplies. overall, good",Dined it at their restaurant and had the pork ribs. The food tastes good but the meat is a bit stiff. Also there were mosquitoes biting you while you eat.,"Unfortunately it was not the same as I saw it on the internet, It was very loud because of the traffic jam and you can hear everything from the other rooms. Sometimes the water from the tap was stinky I do not know why, because I stayed two other hotels, and there was not this problem. I do not think that it is a 3stars hotel, it was always dirty after the cleaning. Even so the staff was very kind and helpful, I gave this 3stars for them."

Thanks for having us!,"I had the pleasure of staying at Xun's listing from December 19 to 26, and it was an absolute delight. Despite my early morning arrival, the check-in process was smooth, thanks to Xun's efficiency. Seeking assistance for airport transfer, Darta and his wife exhibited remarkable patience, waiting for me at the airport and assisting with a seamless check-in process.

The location radiates tranquility, just a short distance from the city. Exploring the surroundings on foot unveiled charming sights and a plethora of restaurants and cafes. Opting for Grab and Gojek to navigate Ubud was convenient, although it's noteworthy that The Griya isn't accessible by car. A brief two to three-minute walk leads to the designated waiting area for cars.

Xun's responsiveness to my queries and her accommodation of requests were exemplary. The warmth extended by Xun's family and Ayu added a personal touch to the experience. The view and the peaceful ambiance of the place were truly captivating. Without hesitation, I would choose Xun's accommodation for future visits and wholeheartedly recommend her listing to anyone seeking a rejuvenating Bali retreat.

My heartfelt thanks to Xun and her wonderful team for making my stay memorable. I eagerly anticipate returning to this tranquil haven for another round of relaxation and exploration.","Such a beautiful place to stay!

The bed was clean and crisp, which was appreciated, although we did wish that it had a bug net since pesky little mosquitos liked to slip in through the cracks in the walls and any open doors or windows.
Breakfast came as it was ordered, and the fruit on the side was fresh and yummy.
The staff was kind and helpful, but I think they spoke a little less English than many other hosts we experienced, so just be aware that it might take a little effort to communicate needs or wants you may have.
This property has an earlier checkout time than anywhere else we stayed and they hustled us along a little bit, but otherwise, this place was great.

But trying babi guling dish should definitely be experienced by tourists who come to Bali and eat pork.
It's an authentic restaurant where locals go for their Babi Guling.
The food is good, I didn't have Bali belly so its safe as the food is prepared daily.

And the best part is you get to mingle with the locals and really experienced how they are as opposed to those locals in the service industry who keep a protective wall around them, who probably have had enough of abusive tourists.

Don't expect much about the place. They have a small menu, it's inexpensive and safe.  Unlike other places serving babi guling, this restaurant is open til 8pm.

I recommend this place to those who want to experience a local Balinese dish for non muslims.","Super first try of babi guling. Whilst travelling around over the last few days, I had noticed the golden pigs in glass cabinets, presented to the streets as we scooted by, so I needed to sample some for myself.
There are a number of places dotted around Ubud so, without a recommendation, I relied on the next best way to find good spot; check if the locals are eating there. I spotted Buk Ari, already with about 10 scooters parked up in the ample parking area - bingo!
I ambled past the already familiar swine cabinet and in to the dining area, large communal tables with bench seating. After some awkward motioning, I finally got the message that I take a seat to be served and I chose the ‚Äòspecial‚Äô, which arrived in minutes.
I was not disappointed - the portions were more than adequate, pork roasted and fried, a fresh ginger and chili sambal, blood sausage, herb salad, a small bowl of broth plus rice, and two types of crackling.
At 45000IRP/4.50AUD it is quite reasonable and very satisfying. Add a bottle of water for 5000IRP/0.50AUD and that is an inexpensive meal-deal or get it to go for even less (very popular with locals).
It will not be for everyone but it is a great experience outside the comfort zone, provided you like pork. I loved it.
jPü§òüèº","This store has a very large space with a very large parking area as well. The taste of the food is also delicious. The price of food here for one portion is 25,000. But I suggest the owner to adding a toilet door and also cleaning it so that visitors feel more comfortable and safe. This place is also easy to find with good road access.",The quality is not bad but the price at 45k is a bit steep compared to other less touristy places. You could have amazing babi guling with a drink at 30k. Still worth a go if trying for the first time.,"Came here with my private driver based on his recommendation, and what a remarkably great find it was. Fantastic Babi Guling and the side dishes were also very tasty. Prices were very reasonable, though since prices are not mentioned on any menus, perhaps we only got such great prices because my driver didn't let them over charge us as tourists. Definitely worth a visit if you want to try true authentic Balinese food!"
