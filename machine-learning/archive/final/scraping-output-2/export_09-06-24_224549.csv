We booked 3 rooms: all three had caterpillars, bed bugs (ticks), and other insects on and around the beds. They switched one of our rooms and it also had the same problem. We weren't able to use the rooms at all. We had arrived at the hotel at night, and we had no choice but to move to a different hotel - at great cost and annoyance to us. The hotel management refused to refund us and took 50% of the payment for our entire multi-day stay (even though we weren't able to use the room a single night). They should have refunded 100%. The reception staff was very friendly and nice and I suspect the issue was the management.  The rooms are basic and were a bit dusty. The road leading up to the hotel is rugged and at a very steep incline. I would highly recommend you avoid this place.","I had the pleasure of staying at this stunning villa in Bali, nestled near the mountains. The spacious rooms provided breathtaking views of the lake and mountains, boasting fresh and fragrant bedding that added to the comfort. The highlight was undoubtedly the private pool, offering a refreshingly invigorating experience. As dining options were limited within walking distance, the hotel helped arrange car bookings with locals. The use of WhatsApp for communication was incredibly convenient. While the breakfast had to be ordered the night before, the menu had great potential and I particularly enjoyed the fresh fruits and avocado; however, slight adjustments like toast thickness or freshly baked bread could enhance the experience further. Despite this, the peaceful location and overall tranquility made the stay truly memorable ‚Äì I'd highly recommend it. Please note there must be renovations recently here as the google pictures dont match where we stayed! its totally been done up!","Superior Double Bed Room with pool access.. room is spacious also the bathroom. All good but maybe for the flies that I had to have 4 stars only.
Service of the staff, I know that they really try their best, kind and informative.
Location of this guest house is the best, great view of the lake and mount Batur,.","Arrived at night and while parking the car, the staff were standing by waiting to carry our luggage. Fast and easy check in and were led to our room. Fantastic spacious room and bathroom. As it's dark, we can't see much of the view. Woke up in the morning, we were greeted with wonderful mountain and lake view.",We didn‚Äôt want to venture far from the hotel because we were only in town for 3 nights and doing the Batur hike. Our young guide Gidde was awesome and we hiked straight from the property all the way to the top. The property seems to be fully renovated now and they offer an all day food menu. Yeoma at the front desk was lovely - nothing was too hard to sort out or menu items to difficult to modify for vegans. The food was very very simple but delicious. Made with care in the tiny kitchen by the young staff. We got a couple of free scooter rides on the house to take us to the hot springs. Our room was right by the pool and massive. They put a queen bed on the floor for our daughter. Amazing views out of the pool and windows. The farmers were clearing fields and burning leaves so we got smoked out of the pool area but I guess that‚Äôs what you get when you stay in the middle of a bunch of farms!

Definitely highly recommend this place if you coming to this area.","Great place with very welcoming staff. Nice and spacious room/cottage with private balcony. Probably the best showers in Bali. Superb lake view. Only minus might be the location. As it's quite new ( still building the pool, should be ready in a couple of weeks) for drivers it's rather inconvenient. However, this is likely to change in the future as it get's more attention.","What a great experience! Highly recommended. They only have 2 glamping tent so there's not many people.

There is a little temple with a beautiful tree right next to the property on the lake almost where you can meditate or make offerings.
We did a great trekking to Batur to see the sunrise. In the evening the girls made a little bonfire by the lake. Was so magical to be embrace by nature and all elements.

But right now there‚Äôs just a big construction zone everywhere you look. There is nothing anymore with peaceful surroundings or pleasant vibe in the Nature of Kintamani. You hear from 7am to 5pm trucks, excavators and other noises. The pool is beautiful but full of dust from the construction and the floor is dirty. Next to the pool was an empty beer bottle in the grass, next to it a bag of trash. In our shower were cigarettes laying on the floor and I don‚Äôt want to talk about the dirt above our mosquito net.

Basic amenities: We have a small cabin with a comfy bed with a mosquito net around the bed to keep the bugs away. There is no AC or fan and you wont need it, as its super chilly throughout the day. There is a kind of an open shower with a palm tree inside the bathroom which looks cool. There is no geyser, the hot shower comes from the natural hot spring which might not be hot thruoughout the day.
Complimentary amenities: We had complimentary breakfast (Pancakes and Omelette with coffee). They have their own hot water pool so you dont have to go to other hot water springs to experience the volcanic heat.
Service: Service was alright.
Location: To get this view and the calm, we had to go bit inside the non-touristy spot. You wont find restaurants near by, and if you need lunch/dinner you need to inform the host before hand.
View: Nothing to conplain about the amazing view of the Lake Batur and the mountains surrounding it.
Suggestions: Need a geyser, as the spring water is not hot all the time. Its bit uncomfortable to have a cold shower or even wash your face with cold water when the climate is so cool there. Also there is no storage in the room, we had to keep all our things on the floor.","i have been traveling asia for 3 months now and i have never met anyone like these owners. so kind, helpful and a joy to talk to. the property is so lovely, right in nature with a beautiful view of the lake and mountains. a relaxing and clam environment after a long travel day","Hard to explain in words, this place was by far the best in bali.

The cabins were made of wood with a half open bathroom.  It was located far from the mainroad so you can feel calm surrounding, suitable for those who like to enjoy quiet environment. There was a small swimming pool with warm water directly came from mountain water source.  We got fried rice for breakfast.

As with almost all accommodation in this area, there is road noise from the passing excursion 4x4s and scooters, which I‚Äôd read about before I went. The owner, Made, can provide foam ear plugs, but I honestly found my noise-cancelling earbuds let me sleep just fine through the night (comfy bed too!). All in all, very good value for money & a warm ambience with great views & a thermal pool! And you can pay here by credit card (for a 3% surcharge), which was helpful as the sole ATM in the nearby area only worked for local bank cards.","The view from this place to the mountains is incredible, it also has a thermal water pool which is a great combination.

The room is very damp and the towels, papers and a bed is always wet.
I suffered from the numerous mites on the bed.
Though the hot shower is available, the water comes from it is very dirty and you can see the bathtub filled with muddy water.
The biggest problem is the hotel does not care about the security.
There are 4-5 big windows in a bed room and a bathroom but the curtains are all transparent, which does not make sense.
I felt as if I were monitored by someone.
And the owner strongly recommended me a quite a expensive mountain tour and he said a ‚Äúguide‚Äù is required to climb the mountain even though I am an experienced climber and it take only 1.5 hour to reach the peak.
It is clear the owner is on the mountain mafia‚Äôs side who threatens and offends tourists who want to see the sunrise at the top of the mountain without a guide who actually is a member of mafia.
If you want to visit this village, I recommend that you stay in Ubud and use a packaged tour."

Only good thing was the amazing view from this place but avoid like the plague. Not an unreasonable person but my experience here was genuinely life shortening.","The hotel is in a great location for mountain and lake pictures, and very close the one of the mountain trekking trails (few minutes walk). Rooms are clean and comfortable, with floor to ceiling windows on one side to enjoy the views. Wi-Fi wasn't great in the rooms but that's been standard pretty much everywhere I've been. Breakfast was delicious (I had an omelette) and everyone was very friendly. The owner was amazing! He found out I was having issues accessing my bank account and pretty much was broke. He tried to help me out in anyway he could think of, including letting me check out several hours late, and ended up driving me two hours to my next hotel without giving a price, only asking what I could afford. He ended up driving me all the next day as well, including stops both days at small local food shops and buying me lunch and letting me try some local fruit. Honestly a really nice guy and beautiful hotel.","We have been here with two persons, September 2018, Deluxe Double Room.

Good things first: Joni, the host, lives there with his family and he is a very nice guy. He wanted to help us in organising things and was just pleasant to talk with. The views over the lake are awesome and the garden with the pool was really beautiful, too.

But the accomodation itself was really terrible and not as expected. We had an unpleasant smell in the bathroom, room was not clean, dirt on the floor, dust on the furniture. Availability of warm water was sporadically. There was no wifi in the room, nor in the breakfast area. Only available near the pool or the reception. The breakfast was prepared for - not lying - 50 min, even though there were only two guests who ordered before us. Breakfast was ok, but not good. Breakfast area was really dirty, too. There was dirt and litter on the floor and the table blankets were dirty with remainders of food on them. We booked a hiking tour to Mt Batur with Joni, which was also not as expected. We have been promised an English speaking guide, but his English was very poor, so it was not easy to talk with him. We got no information about anything during the hike, which is not about the definition of a guided tour imho. Also we have been promised more than enough water to drink, but the guide only took 0.5 L per person. At least Joni bought us one more bottle after pick-up. The tour was also really expensive, 600.000 IDR per person. In the first place we agreed to the price, afterwards we really felt kind of ripped off.

Compared to other stays you can get on Bali, this one is expensive, really in the top area of the price range. When we booked it, we were expecting something exceptionally nice. In the end, I wouldn't like to stay here even for a fourth of the price.
I can really recommend to not stay here. There is a lot, that needs to change here, before I would consider this place nice again.","The plumbing was biblical, the sink wouldn‚Äôt drain, the loo wouldn‚Äôt flush, hot water was as real as my supermodel girlfriend. Large prehistoric insects plagued our room. Screeching children could be heard messing around on a loud speaker at the nearby temple. Sound proofing was none existent, I could have a conversation with people the adjacent room without raising my voice. I waited an hour for breakfast despite being the only customer. The pool looked riddled with tropical diseases. With each passing our here my will to live ebbed away.  Having said that the view was great.","This place got a new owner, since then its way better. Great food. Amazing view from the room to lake and mountain. We made a tour to the Batur Volcano. The staff is very nice and friendly. The pool has natural hot spring water. Tip: go swim there at night!"

I cannot recommend this place enough, not only because the whole place is stunning, private, amazing room, comfortable bed, nice pool and has also and outside kitchen area, but the best are its owners.
Dio and Komang are the best host we could have had, we were so lucky to have them, they never treat us like business but family, showing us the best places in Bali, taking us around and we could also try ALl the Balinese fruits, because they were so nice  stopping along the way to buy all for us everytime they could.
They both absolutely made me love more Bali even more.
Never going to forget waking up with the really Yummy breakfast Dio and Komang prepared for us, all the conversations, smiles and the hospitality! Dio is such a hard worker man but always smile and try to gives the best.
I hope I can come back soon and get to know them even better üôè
