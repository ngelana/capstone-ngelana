The location is spectacular with breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean. The entire resort is impressive, with architecture, elements, and decorations that are locally inspired with modern touches. Our villa was a little paradise, complete with a private plunge pool. The room and bed were super comfortable, and the bathroom was huge and classy, featuring an outdoor shower that immerses you in the tropical lushness.

The resort's shared infinity pool was a fantastic experience, with cabanas available for relaxation. There's also a private beach with facilities for spending the whole day, although be aware that the waters are very rough and not suitable for swimming. The cliffs around are beautiful, adding to the stunning scenery.

The drinks at the restaurant were delicious and paired perfectly with small dishes. The most admirable aspect was the service. Our butler, Debora, and the rest of the staff were super friendly and attentive, always ready with contagious smiles that added a positive dose of energy each day.

This place is truly one of a kind and highly recommended. The 5-star rating hardly does justice to what the resort offers.",The hotel is beautiful and breath taking views from nearly every spot on the property‚Ä¶ but the staff is what really makes this place exceptional. Every one was so attentive and kind. We travel with three smaller kids and they went above and beyond welcoming them. Jun was our butler and like magic he was there every time we were trying to make a decision on what to do or where to go. He seemed to arrive from know where and was always such a huge help explaining the options both at the property and off. Our last day he arranged for one of the staff to take us into his village and show us the daily lives of locals. Explains the cultural through the eyes of the local villages. It gave us an appreciation for the people and the culture we would not have had otherwise. This has been a pleasure beyond our high expectations and we will definitely be back when next we find ourselves in Bali.,"The Bulgari Hotel Bali is a stunning hotel with  breath taking views. That said, it‚Äôs the staff that really makes the hotel so wonderful. Thank you to Putu, Ode and Simon for it and amazing week. In particular, huge call out to the team for making my partner‚Äôs birthday celebration (done by design) as special special evening and a special week. Thank you for the flowers and the breakfast happy birthday serenade. What a week. üòÄ","We stayed at the Bulgari Hotel from April to May 2024 in a three-bedroom mansion. The service was perfect in every way, from the smallest details to the most important aspects.

For example, our mom has a surgically treated back and needs a firm mattress. In other hotels, even those that agreed to my request (like North Island), the mattress remained unchanged. At Bulgari, however, they actually replaced the soft mattress with a firm one.

The cleaning quality was outstanding. We witnessed a team of around 12-15 staff members conducting daily cleaning simultaneously. They vacuumed all the floors and then washed them every day! They cleaned the windows, vacuumed the furniture, and despite our young children, the villa sparkled with cleanliness every day.

The friendliness and hospitality of the staff were exceptional. Several times, the team even refused to accept tips!

We were provided with the freshest fruits in unlimited quantities upon request, even rare ones like custard apples. Any request we made was fulfilled promptly, efficiently, and most importantly, with joy by the team. This hotel seems to be managed by a brilliant manager who has organized the team‚Äôs work at such a high level!

Special thanks to Rizky, Melissa, Wisnu, Sabina, and Varvara for their exceptional service.

I want to mention some downsides, but there simply aren‚Äôt any. Kudos to Bulgari Bali! We will definitely be back!","good place, The room has a perfect view. Going down the 150-meter cliff elevator, the view of the Indian Ocean is really spectacular. The room is cleaned twice every morning and evening, very meticulously, and the swimsuits to be dried will be put away for you. The breakfast is very delicious. There are three different menus to choose from, and you can experience different tastes every day. All in all, Bulgari Bali is worthy of the title of luxury, nice place!"

Facilities: really great for working with proper desk and screen and aircon. Huge place to meditate or do yoga too. Pool is great. On site restaurant is amazing and food were delicious!

Room: comfortable to me, great for 2 maximum. Floor is not that comfortable for walking around without slipper. You will hear people talking next door, accept it. Aircon may not be cool enough during day time.

Environment: you will hear rooster and birds around 6am every morning, not for light sleeper or midnight owl! Bring earplugs if you need it. Very clean too!

Service: absolutely fabulous!","Stayed for 3 nights, for the price it was very value for money! Saw many reviews saying the rooms were very small but if you‚Äôre only bringing cabin-sized luggage it‚Äôs still alright! Aircon was working well also, contrary to some reviews that said the room was hot. Surprisingly, there weren‚Äôt that many insects despite the location and greenery surrounding the room, there were some ants but nothing too serious.

The slightly disappointing thing was our bedding was full of stains, not just 1 but at least 10. However, since we checked in very late at 10pm, we decided to request for a change in bedding only the next day, which they did change to a fresh and clean one. The first night was also quite eventful, with a group of people drinking, laughing and talking loudly late into the night at 1.30am while we were trying to sleep. At 5.30am, we were once again awakened by the crows of a rooster. Would suggest bringing some ear plugs if you want to have a good night‚Äôs sleep! The next 2 nights were, thankfully, more peaceful and uneventful.

Got breakfast the third day as I saw reviews saying the food is good, and boy, it was good! Had the baked eggs moringa pesto and it came with easily the best sourdough bread I‚Äôve ever had! The baked eggs dish itself was really good too. Wish I had eaten their breakfast every day!

Really appreciated the fact that they had a waster dispenser for us to fill water, considering the fact that tap water is not potable. Service was also good, no complaints at all. Overall, despite the dirty bedding and noise encountered, it was still a very pleasant stay at the price point! Would probably stay again in future.","The best decision to stay here. Quiet, well cared for and comfortable. Moreover, they provide free water from a dispenser so it means you get to avoid extra plastic use.","A cozy place. The rooms are small, but have everything you need (air conditioning, kettle, water, tea, coffee, refrigerator, TV). Delicious breakfasts. Everything I tried except breakfast was very tasty. Cappuccino and matcha are perfect ‚ù§Ô∏è The only thing they don't have is decaf coffee.","This was our last stop in Bali (after a month of hopping around), and I'm so glad we chose this place. Staff is very helpful and friendly. The hotel/rooms/garden was one of the most well-kept places I've seen in Bali (on an ""average"" budget). Rooms were very clean and well maintained, and all amenities are necessary (fridge, kettle, smart TV, safe, etc). With a small gym and a working area, as well as a good restaurant. I can tell there's a real effort from the side of the owners/management to keep everything at a good standard. Would definitely recommend!"

Highly recommend,"Great location, easily accessible by car/scooter near the main road, yet calm and private. They have a cute dog, and the check in is very flexible.","I booked a room through Agoda. Upon arrival we were given a standard room instead of a deluxe room, which we had paid for. They told us that the mistake was Agoda's, without giving us any solution or reward. The standard room they gave us smelled like naphthalene to cover up the sewer smell. Our experience there was terrible and they didn't want to help in any way, they just blamed Agoda and kept our money. I wish them all the best for the future. I am attaching pictures, but the worst was the smell."

Best food ever in Bali;
happy to have a good food after two weeks in this island. The Place in elegant , interior design, food, were all like an art work; live music made it even more pleasant.
The chef checks on you during the dining, nice to meet this talented chef with his nice taste and choice of foods, design and balanced tastes were the most pleasant part of the experience.
Transport, polite and helpful staffs, amazing sunset view before dinner at the bar of the hotel; all give you Probably the best experience in Bali.
Ladies feel free to have your heels on and have the best photos of you in Baliüòâ","Our best culinary experience in Bali and one of the best internationally as well. Young chef Alessandro Mazzali executed every dish to perfection.
The spaghetti with bottarga, the lamb cooked in clarified butter, the scallop and the smoked wagyu were standout dishes for me but everything was really great.
The spaghetti cooked perfectly al dente,
the lamb was so tender you could cut it with your fork,
the wagyu, also very tender, was accompanied with veal sweetbread stuffed red pepper (so good) had a nice Smokey flavour but not overpowering as many smoked foods tend to be.
We went to this restaurant twice during our stay and would not hesitate to return next time we are in Bali. It has been a while since a meal has made me feel this way.
Bravo","December 4th dinner. The first thing that you notice is the incredible service from the host to the waiters, so naturally friendly and helpful. We were still full from lunch so they kindly revised the tasting menu (they only have 2 options typically, a 7-course or a 5-course) so that we could have a 3-course dinner. This was perfect for us and stills comes with the amuses bouches and all the petit fours at the end. The three courses we had were the seared tuna, a lobster dish and a cold spaghetti in squid ink with caviar. Divine. Perfectly executed and we devoured it all. Well worth a visit if you are staying at the hotel or wish to go for a romantic dinner. Bravo.",Delicious Italian food in Bali! The restaurant is located in the Bulgari hotel on a terrace and has a water stream running through it. The ambiance is relaxing and the d√©cor beautiful! The staff was extremely friendly and the chef adapted to our dietary requirements. I particularly recommend the truffle risotto which was delicious and generous in summer black truffle!,"Truly the best of the best that Bali has to offer in the way of fine dining. The experience is one set to take the taste buds through an eclectic gustatory journey of tastes and smells that are rarely mastered to be delivered on a plate. We embarked on the 8 course degustation that delivered excellence to every dish. Without spoiling things to much, you can expect smoked eel from Holland through to Sicilian tiger prawns and much more. After chatting with the head chef, he explained it was their duty to deliver nothing but the best produce that they can source from the world to make the experience stand and deliver. Ambiance and staff were on point. Prepare to take the credit card as this is not your ordinary pricing nor should it be. If you want to impress or treat yourself whilst down this part of the island....This is the place to visit"
