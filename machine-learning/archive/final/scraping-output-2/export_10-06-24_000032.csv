Can do a factory tour or just shop. Also has a restaurant and bar. The construction from bamboo is beautiful. Can sample different percentages of cacao chocolate before purchasing. Lots of beautiful decorations made of chocolate.,"I discovered this place back in 2018 when some friends made a tour to Mt Batur and then stop here for a meeting. You can get some nice chocolate here, ice cream, pralines, coffee and some other specialities. You can sit in front of a nice pool and use it, if you want. Very nice place which I can recommend.","Love the space, nice pool. Great food. Awesome chocolate, koman Anari helped us with tasting and we bought many that we ate on the way before even getting home LOL.","Location is beautiful, chocolate really good, but the pralines are quite pricey and I was not told that they sold per piece! Ended up with 3 little pralines for almost 5$! If you don't care about money it's the perfect place to go!","Good food, ambience and service. So value for money, aniway this place already open. U can see the chocolate production behind the glass, its so cool, the chocolate itself also amazingly rich, never thought indonesia will have this kind of chocolate. Happy to know. Also they serve gelato in very fancy place. Kids  could have their time at swimming pool. Cool place."

Staff was accommodating and let our 5 year old roam around taking in the displays of chocolate that they make on-site.

Had the duck which was excellent!

One let down was last call on food which disrupted our plans a few times and could be better communicated online.","Koko Bambo restaurant is located away from the hustling and busy city. The ambience is calm and facing the paddy fields is breathtaking.
The food was mouth watering, the staff took uterly care with the menu.
We ordered salmon steak and pizza.","Stunning bamboo building overlooking its pool to rice field. Unique food menu which a mix of western meets local indonesian and touch of chocolate. Great place for chill out with friends and its attached with the Mason Gourmet Chocolate factory with its hi-tect equipments which produce huge selection of deluxe chocolates like pralines, truffles, super thins and chocolate bars","A beautiful restaurant with rice field view.

The restaurant has an infinity pool. You can ask for towels.

Good chocolate.","Restaurant with classic bamboo architecture with fresh air in the village of Taro, along to safari lodge and alternative route to Kintamani tourist destination"
