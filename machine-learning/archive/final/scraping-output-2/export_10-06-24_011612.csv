One thing for improvement, I.think the restaurant food could improve in quality a bit","I honestly love this hotel. The service is  exceptional. You feel like royalty when you're here. The food is 10/10. It's clean and really aesthetically pleasing. I have felt incredibly well looked after here and had the best sleep since I can remember.

Oh and the entrance to the hotel is damn cool!","What an amazing experience! From the very beginning, my stay has been nothing short of fantastic. The establishment itself is lovely‚Äîspacious, impeccably clean, and remarkably quiet. However, what truly made my stay unforgettable was the exceptional staff (Thanks to Mega, Pitri, Elsi and all) They were incredibly friendly, attentive, caring, and accommodating, turning my vacation into a truly memorable experience. The breakfast buffet exceeded expectations, with not only the usual offerings but also skilled cooks adding a personalized touch to every dish. The room was spacious, inviting, and everything functioned perfectly. I indulged in the spa services, and the massage was wonderfully relaxing. If I were to offer a suggestion to the hotel, it would be to consider offering yoga classes, tours, and currency exchange services for even greater guest convenience.","I am so glad to have chosen this hotel for my first stay in Bali. The entire staff is so good and helpful. Their hospitality is the best. The rooms are clean and have a good view of the city and the entire stay experience is so good overall, you will be comfortable for your trip.

Best price for a hotel of its category.

Breakfast is plain but tasty and nourishing.

A surprising bonus is the fact that its bathrooms has 'bath chairs'.

Highly recommended.","Bad experience: The bed linens are full of hairs and not clean neither is good textile, I asked to get a room with clean linens and changed 3 rooms with same conditions ü§Ø so I had to ask for clean linens to change myself in the middle of the night as too tired to change hotel.

Also very noisy 24h, couldn't sleep, the hotel is not maintained, is not like in photos.

While resting in our room, someone was continuously trying to enter our room and they successfully barged in. Luckily, we had the latch in and they were unable to enter. We decided to check out immediately and booked another hotel beside (MaxOne, which was much nicer) and demanded a refund.
We were then told by the receptionist that it was a cleaner who didn't know the room was occupied. We didn't get any refund or apology for the unpleasant and unsafe experience. Book MaxOne instead.","Good value but the rooms needed to be cleaned more, I was offered to choose from three rooms which I really appreciated.

Would've liked the staff to change the sheets and tidy the room when I asked but they didn't.

Not bad if you're not fussy and staying for a short stay.",I wouldn‚Äôt trust this place. One of the staff stole money straight from my bag. Money was in my backpack pocket and after someone came to clean our room we came back and the money was gone. Tried to talk to the manager and all he did was say there was no proof. They didn‚Äôt do anything to make the situation right. We were gone from the room for only 2 hours and only one person came into our room to clean it and they still asked for proof. After this the hotel felt very unsafe and uncomfortable. Definitely do not recommend. Stealing from the room is completely unforgivable.

With native birds and the sunrise beside the BIG GWK what more could I ask for

The staff so accommodating

The room is nice, amenities is complete, towel and sheets are clean.
The water kettle is dirty, but they changed with the new one right away after I ask.
The bathroom is spacious and clean. Too many mosquitoes when you spend time outdoor, though they prepare repellent. The pool is not too big.

I also had a massage here. I can definitely recommend the balinese massage, one of the best in town.","Stay: 2 nights
Room: Villa

Liked: The location is perfect. Super close to GWK and most restaurants are within reach. The property is good, maintained, has lots of green spaces and the pool is also clean and decent enough for a quick plunge. The bed is comfy and the environment is calm and quiet.

Disliked¬†¬∑¬†IT HAS LOTS OF CATERPILLARS!!!! It's A LOT and it was disgusting. The bathroom has a bit of an open space and it was covered by lots of them. They don't bite or anything and we manage to have a decent stay since the room is safe to sleep, but it wasn't a pleasant experience. They're not dangerous but the management should've called a pest control or something to avoid this issue. The service is ok. The receptionist wasn't there when we arrived so we had to call them. It's still an easy process but just didn't meet my standard of hospitality.","I (and my friends) really like the place. We booked one night, finally we spent few more nights there. The bungalows were perfect, fresh and clean. Really good.
The location is great, close to shops, not far from the amazing beaches and on the way to Uluwatu. It‚Äôs possible to rent scooters for a cheap price. On site there is a place to do yoga and a spa, I didn‚Äôt try but from the outside it looks great. Breakfast, juices etc. are also available.
But more important, what I like the most was the experience and the quality of the service, we were lucky to have them, they even helped us to coordinate our journey in Bali (Thank you Lia). Really appreciated it."

Thank you for this experience ‚ù§Ô∏è","We have stayed here for one month recently.
The building is new and location is very good, close to GWK statute.

Pros: Clean and modern room and kitchenette.
Water pressure is quite good including draining, which is very rare in Bali.
The cabinets are very useful.
Staff members are nice.
Nice refrigerator.
Comfortable beds and towels, linens.
The kitchenette and gas work fine.
Very easy for Gojek delivery or internet shopping.
Some nice restaurants around the area, and supermarket is 2-3 minutes away.
Not facing on the main load, so the building itself is quiet and peaceful.
Very nice design, feels like a hotel room.

Cons:  Internet is very very slow and unstable. For example, sometimes cannot watch YouTube because it is too slow, and Zoom meeting is very challenging to do without cutting off so many times during the meeting. Not recommended for digital nomads, or use an internet heavily.
If you hardly use an internet, or only text messages, it is ok.
Cockroaches are quite active and huge despite of the cleanliness of the building. So if you do not like bugs, I do not recommend.
Although it is nonsmoking, no pets building, there are many people smoke outside the door, and many cats are coming into the buildings and the rooms. Like 4 or 5 regular cats are coming, and I had 3 cats came into my room several times.
It is like a big cats house. Some guests keep them inside too.
So if you do not like smoking nor cats, I do not recommend.
The wall is very thin, so you can hear people walking, talking, watching TV etc... easily.
TV was broken in my room, so never watched it.
The housekeeper is quite random, and coming less, which I did not mind at all.   But if you want to have a full service, you need to remind them many times until you get the full service.

This is a perfect place for off-grid, yoga, meditation type of solo traveler or a couple who like cats and ok with smoking and bugs.

Main residences are Russians.
And many of them are very active at night.
So depends on the room location, you might hear the neighbors talking, watching TV, other noises.
If you are light sleeper, it might bother you a lot.
If you are deep sleeper, you should be fine.

Except an internet connection and cockroaches, I liked the building a lot.
I wish I could stay longer, but they do not accept children, and I have a toddler, so we needed to move out only for a month.","Lived here for 2 months. Modern clean room, very comfy bed, fast internet, friendly staff and owner, nice pool. Cleaning always on time.

We were alone in here.  I ordered a ribeye steak, it was well done even though I ordered medium.  The meat was 4. The pie is very tasty and the sauce is divine.  The food was not delivered at the same time. Alcohol is relatively inexpensive.  There is enough to choose from the menu. The waiter was very friendly and helpful, left a good impression. Noisy from the road, I think if there was live music, it would brighten up the atmosphere.  Overall 4 out of 5.","Cozy, great fish n chips and fast service. In most bars I have trouble with conversations and relaxing but this place gets it. Good sound system keeps it lively outdoors and indoors is a classic pub vibe","I and my family went there after read it's good reviews. We ordered Meat lover pizza, lamb steak (well done) and pub classic steak and cheese pie for the foods and orange juice, virgin mojito and Shirley temple. It took long time for them to serve the foods to our table. The pizza was pretty good. It may our bad luck, the lamb steak come very tough and dry. My husband barely ate it, he gave a small cut to me to try, which was hardly chewed. My hushand informed about this to the waiter and he asked to take it away for our pet. Pub classic steak taste pretty bland, the sauce (looks like demi glace sauce) help a bit to enhance the flavour even though the sauce itself seems to be diluted as the flavour was not rich anymore. The mocktails we ordered it didn't meet to our expectations . Either they need to add up the ingredients or adjust the glass size to a smaller one.
In my opinion, it doesn't worth the money.
Parking space is available but limited.
They do have air conditioner inside but it feels hotter and humid than outside.

Reply to owner's response:
Thank you for taking time to read my review. It's not just the first time we ordered well done steak, I personally always choose this level of doneness everytime I order Steak in any other restaurants, however, should it is the standard of The Little Irish then I have nothing to comment on. To clarify as well, when my husband reported it, the lady was only apologize, no replacement offered. Should she did, we certainly accept the offer.

Thank you and kind regards",Great little bar in Uluwatu.. staff extremely friendly and a good fun place to have a good feed and the Craic.,"It was ok, we popped in for a few beers. The beers weren't very cold as with most places in Bali. It wouldn't hurt to stay on top of this so customers could have icy cold drinks.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back but I am glad I gave it a try."

I had the Beef Rendang fried rice and they allow you to choose your spice level, the Brulle Bombs and a Jasmine ice tea. I visited maybe half an hour before closing time and still got service with a smile and the quality of the food was outstanding!

I will definitely return! Great job lads!","Mask campur very delicious 10/10. Nice place with authentic Balinese cuisine. Big portions, huge variety of dishes. I recommend it to everyone who is looking for authentic Indonesian food üôåüèº","I was looking for Authentic Indonesian Cuisine, wanted to try some local food, look no further. This  place is so unique, food is so tasteful you can feel it! Very recommended  long story short, try it  yourself!","A very nice place and with a truly chef's food I recommend to everyone, they really have the talent of cooking, thank you team Rendang Roll Bali Jimbaran","The fried rice is superb and the chicken satay is tender and fragrant.
The price is very reasonable hence delivering good value.
Just that the tables were covered with dust as it is beside a main thoroughfare that is climbing a steep hill, so lots of dust, exhaust and noise."

We were warmly welcomed by the owner and ordered the prawn poke bowl, the chicken wrap, and iced ginger teas to drink. Every one of these dishes were healthy and delicious. The pieces of chicken and prawns in the food were high quality. The sweet potato fries that came with the chicken wrap were delicious. You can tell that the chef cooked them with care and love. We would highly recommend this place to anybody looking for high quality food at reasonable prices.","‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

I visited this charming restaurant today for a quick bite and a refreshing drink to go. I ordered a flat white, a berry smoothie, and a shrimp bowl for takeout.
The owner welcomed me with warmth and hospitality, going above and beyond to ensure top-notch service. Although they were out of mango for the bowl, they promptly informed me and generously substituted it with extra tempeh, which turned out to be delicious!
Despite the wait, which is understandable given that the owner is cooking also, the food tasted really great, reflecting the care and passion put into every dish.
Thank you for the wonderful food & drinks , and I look forward to returning soon!","One of my favorite places to hang out in Bali !
Joe, the owner, is the best host and has the most amazing personality. He‚Äôs one of the people that can bring an immediate smile to my face even on a gloomy day.
His place is cute, cozy, and he will have a fan blowing in your face on a hot day which is truly appreciated.
His food is delicious and high quality even if very affordable ! That‚Äôs due to him also having been a chef in different parts of the world. The cacao smoothie is to die for as well. So stop thinking and just come here !","The Nasi Goreng is a must try!
Amazing hospitality of Joe made it even better.
Prices are pretty good actually for the quality and its a nice place to take some pictures","Nasi goreng perfectly cook great! Not too oily and worth for the price. Theyre so attentive, and come to the table to ask ‚Äú Hows your  food or anything. I love the service!!. Glad i found this area ,  i was passing by to look something to chill and at the same time to eat. This place is highly recommended! Thank you üôèüèΩ
