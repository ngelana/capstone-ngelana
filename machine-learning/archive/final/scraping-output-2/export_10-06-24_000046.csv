ChIJr34HtMgZ0i0RKQ_GK1FynJo,Pondok Yana Villa,-8.4115446,115.3270483,"H8QG+9RM, Manukaya, Tampaksiring, Gianyar Regency, Bali 80552, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=11140905271160082217,OPERATIONAL,+62 877-5628-5588,lodging,lodging,4.6,32,,"i went here with my friends at nyepi. the villa building itself is considered good since the price is low. but on the second day the electricity and the water stopped functioning, everything turned upside down. we had no electricity and water AT ALL for a day and it was nyepi which means we have nowhere to go. the wifi was sucks too, very slow and on the second day it  was not functioning at all since the electricity is dead. the staff also not sure what they have to do. it's also pretty hard to reach the villa, the road is horrible. really our worst experience renting a villa, definitely going not back.","We booked from 2nd to 4th March. The NYEPI ( silent ) day was on the 3rd. We know well what should do and what shouldnt be done on this Holy Day. No bright lights allowed, not allowed to be on the street, no noise etc. That all things we know well.

On the 2nd was fine. But exactly on the 3rd was terriblu. There was a major problem with the electric installation in villa and owner just didnt do anything. It is not that we want to switch on lights, but no electric means no aircon, no hot water even no cold water. We couldnt use toilet bowl. So the silent day we expected to be a nice day but it was a nightmare.","Nice,peacefull and relaxing place very recommendid place to stay.
The villa is perfect to stay longer even one night so amazing and the staff very friendly
And helpful also wayan  is a owesome driver and guide, we have a wonderful experience stay in Bali.","great villa!  friendly hostess!
