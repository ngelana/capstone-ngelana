Kuta Sel., Kabupaten Badung, Bali 80361, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=14463903510990569457,OPERATIONAL,+62 821-4784-3403,guest_house,"guest_house, lodging",3.8,125,,"I have placed an honest review on Booking. It is incredible sad to see the owner gets so offensive and has send me a very rude message back. Really not a way to treat customers. Honestly, it is up to you, but to me I have never been talked to by a owner like this.

The review I have written:
We had a 50/50 experience at this place. The place itself is very beautiful. It is really an oasis. It has a nice pool area and even a private small pool near your room. They had a good recommendation to rent a scooter, as that is mainly the way to go around. They have many dogs around which we love. Don’t be scared if they bark at you when you enter, some are shy and they are very friendly. Breakfast had a enough of options.

However, as the roof from the room is open from the sides, we had so many mosquitos in the room (eventhough we kept the door and windows shut the whole time and we turned on the airconditioning). When we asked for a mosquito net, there wasn’t any possibility. Also because of the open roof there were geckos in the room. Which we usually don’t find annoying, but these ones were like 50cm of size. As well were there a lot of centipedes walking on the floor and we even had some ants in the bed. We stayed with tribes in like the middle of nature, so we are used to a lot, but from a place like this you expect something else.

As we arrived very ill of bali belly we didn’t had any energy to say anything about it. When we asked for some bread to eat at night, there wasn’t any (although there is bread in the morning for breakfast?). They told us to wait until the morning and ask for plain rice. As a tip for the owners. If your guests are ill it is a very small but nice gesture to recommend a pharmacy near by, or offer them some tea or something like this.

It is very misleading to put a 100+ pictures at the room section. You don’t know which room you will get. We thought we would get the white room as those are the first pictures shown, this was not the case.

Also they cleaned our room on departure day already between 9-10, while we still wanted to be in our room. A little bit a waste of time for the cleaners + it made us feel like we had to rush out of the place (although check-out is at 12).

I don’t want to sound like I can only complain, but these are some important things the hotel should really take notice of.

THE RESPONSE OF THE OWNER:
That’s right, you’re just complaining!
Reservation reminder 2 days 27 euros per night check in at 3 p.m. but villa given away at 1 p.m. due to illness! No thanks! Normal !
When my wife is hungry at 10 p.m., I take my scooter and go get her something to eat! I don't bother the boss for 2 slices of bread while the kitchen is closed.
When my wife is sick, I look at Google and take my scooter to pick up medicine from the pharmacy 500 m away. I'm not bothering the boss by accusing them of not telling them where the pharmacy is!
For misleading photos... contact Booking which requires many photos.
It's because of people like you who can't stand cows, roosters in the countryside and who complain about 10 or 50 cm geckos, frogs, ants... that Bali is becoming concrete... Chez Villa Anjing our roofs are local in Alang Alang manufactured in Bali, by Balinese and installed by Balinese in the Balinese tradition.
Our 2000 m2 garden is an eco system in which different animals live and no offense to concrete lovers, we will not change or replace all of this with CONCRETE. Stay in Europe in your concrete cities or go to Kuta but please don't come to us for criticism by staying 2 nights....

MY RESPONSE BACK:
It is sad to see you can’t see positive in the feedback you get. Only ratings of like 10/10 won’t help you to grow. Good luck with your business.

THE RESPONSE OF THE OWNER:
Customers who stay 2 days and only write complaints without seeing the value for money and the benefits will never help us grow. Especially since we don't need advice from 25-year-olds who know nothing about this profession and the life of a company.","Had 3 nights stay and I loved it. Friendly owner, big pool with beautiful lush garden and friendly dogs. The dogs might be barking at you at first, but after some sniffing, they will be fine. The room was lovely, spacious and open air bathroom with blasting water pressure. So quiet and peacefull at night. The breakfast was served in one big table along with the other guest so you can feel a social atmosphere. Definetly will come back again.","Caroline and Paul keep a beautiful and welcoming place.
The atmosphere is very relaxed and energising at the same time.
We found a mix of people on vacation in Bali (families, individuals, couples), and people staying in Bali for longer periods.
Everything was very clean and everyone was very friendly, Caroline and Paul are very helpful in arranging logistics as well as special requests. Laundry was not a problem either. There's always a supply of drinking water available in the kitchen.
Looking forward to return when we come to Bali again.
One of us worked out of the open-air kitchen during our stay, which wasn't a problem either.",Had an awesome couple of nights at Villa Anjing! Owners and staff were great! Due to a customer overstaying at their other villa I was quickly moved to this one which was a big upgrade at no extra costs. Pool area is awesome with a great view and room was also very nice. Everything kept super clean thanks to the great staff and breakfast was delicious. Thanks Paul and Carolina!,"Purr-fectly Designed Accommodations: Cozy beds, spacious rooms – a pet-friendly retreat that feels like home."
