Padangbai and the surrounding areas are really beautiful and the hotel is well located if you rent a motorbike! A few minutes from the port and not far from other lovely beaches/waterfalls etc. The Staff were so accommodating and friendly, the lovely dogs and family feel was so welcoming. We really recommend this place for its well priced, nice rooms, friendly staff and surrounding beauty! Thank you so much for our stay :)","Sheets seemed a little dirty and the double was just two singles next to each other. No mini fridge which would have been nice. Aircon and bathroom good. Location wise it‚Äôs a walk or short taxi into town so getting food isn‚Äôt the easiest. Also, there are millipedes everywhere when you step outside your room. Staff are lovely.",I stayed for two days to go diving in Pandang Bai. The place is nice and quiet and the rooms are spacious. Warm Water worked at all times but to me the bathroom looked a bit unkempt. But I would recommend this place!,really enjoyed my stay here at dewi villa. the staff were so friendly and were so helpful. they helped to book our discovery dive for us and were able to answer all our questions about padangbai. location is a little away from the main port so it's nice and quiet at the foot of the mountains with great views from the top. super cute dogs too!,"Edited: the owner refunded us the money after this review.

THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Do not book with this hotel. Jackhammer 5 meters away from my room, literally the room was shaking! The owner refused to pay back and was rude on the phone.

Edited: after a bad review and wasting our time the owner paid us back. We had to drive back to get our money ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThe main problem with the owner is the fact that he DID NOT LISTEN, speaking over us without giving us a chance to say a word. Their ‚Äúno refund policy‚Äù on Agoda gives you no option to cancel on your side, even if the noice is impossible. However the owner didn‚Äôt seem to know that the customers have no option to cancel on Agoda, repeating himself hundreds of times that we should cancel on our end ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è please listen to your guests: the construction will be over but the reviews are here to stay."

Took us my daughter and I by boat to 2 snorkelling spots and Blue Lagoon. He took lots of underwater photos of all the fish and coral we saw. Also great footage of us both diving underwater. Hundreds of photos all clear were sent to our WhatsApp immediately. Highly recommend him for a wonderful snorkeling experience.,"We (me and my brother) did snorkel in Tanjung Jepun and Blue Lagoon. The owner (Mr Ketut) made us very comfortable and spent time effectively, also guiding us to find best spot (underwater) for photo. He also looked after us, to make sure there‚Äôs nothing bad happened. We stopped and snorkel at 2 spot, and saw beautiful coral and much much tropical fish. The owner also allow us free of time for exploring the snorkel area, without rush us to the next spot. It feels like a private tour !","Recommended by our driver , We are happy to the services provided by Bali fastboat service. They are very concerned about the safety and took  care of everything for our snorkeling exploring  . Strongly recommend it .  Thanks to Captain KeChu (?) and the pretty lady at counter  who helped us downloaded photos from the camera provided by the shop .  Everything was smooth.","Thanks you for use my service, snorkeling at blue lagoon. Hope you enjoy your vacation üôèüôèüôè","The guide is amazing, the boat is comfortable, all the snorkeling equipment was in perfect condition, 100% recommended.

Thanks"
