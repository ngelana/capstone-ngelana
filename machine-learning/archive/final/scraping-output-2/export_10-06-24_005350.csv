Blahbatuh, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80581, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=10242413523634556629,OPERATIONAL,,coffee_shop,"coffee_shop, cafe, food, store",4.7,154,,"The cafe is located near the road, but it's not noisy and the atmosphere is very calm. Parking is quite convenient too.

Inside and outside the cafe there are many places to seat. There are tables for groups.  There are sockets that allow you to work. However, it is stuffy because there is no air conditioning. But the main point is gorgeous view!

The staff is friendly, but not everyone speaks English. And they forgot about my order and prepared it for a long time (but it was just a starter). I went up to remind them and a minute later they brought my food.

Prices do not include taxes, but are cheap. For such prices the food tastes good.

The only thing missing is paper towels for hands in the toilet.","Very good vibes and tasty food and drinks
I highly recommend. More variety in food Menu would be even better.","The coffee was really good i ordered caramel macchiato, will come again, the food is good.

Edit : the service was really okay now, doesn't feel comfortable here for some reason and i do agree that they have issues with general cleaning, in this place most tables have ants.

Still the coffee is really consistent in terms of taste that I'm just gonna downgrade this to 4star for now. And the food is okay. Def come here just for the coffee üòÅ.","A trendy coffeeshop, very friendly young people working there. The coffee was really good. The view is wonderful , and the atmosphere relax so is the music. A ‚ÄúZen‚Äù place.","Awesome view and good prices.
Totally worth it"
