With a variety of options to choose from, the grilled and fried chicken are the standouts here.
Both are incredibly tender and flavorful - I could easily eat a whole chicken myself! With branches all over Denpasar, this is definitely a must-visit spot for anyone in the area. Highly recommended!","Despite the crowded situation the staffs can manage all table.
Ayam kremesnya enak bgt. Ayamnya so juicy.","A busy place due to its famous reputation. Chicken menu is super. The portion is quite big, especially the chicken. But the portion of rice is normal. One of the must list if you want to adventure local culiner in Denpasar","REALLY GOOOOOOD
You must try Bebek Goreng here","went there with friend, food was decent but i can not imagine they cheated out my total!

im the type of person that always counts what i order before i got to the cashier, and this lady had the audacity of cheating me out for 10k by giving me less change. can you imagine if im not the only one? when i called her out on it she said that it was her mistake, because she got confused. and she can‚Äôt even give me the receipt when i ask for it, she just threw it in the trash under the cashier"

I have been using booking for at least 9 years in different parts of the world (South America, Central America, USA, Europe and Southeast Asia) and I have NEVER entered a place so unkept and unhealthy. According to the reviews we read before we knew we would not stay in an excellent place, but since our purpose was to stay near Inmigrations we took it. As soon as we entered the room the smell of black mold is STRONG !!!!
AC does not work at all (not even the fan), I told the manager about it and he told me that it ""took time"". Understanding and deciding to wait, we found more than 5 cockroaches half dead along with hundreds of stains on the walls of dubious origin (crushed insects, blood and some brown stains), but what really broke our patience was finding mouse droppings on and inside the bed as well as on the pillows.
There were 2 managers, 1 of them very kindly trying to offer us another room (which we refused because we would not stay in that place and risk our health) but the other very arrogant saying that they would not do the refund and contact booking, (we say we need proof that we are not staying there for obviously reasons) and saying in a really rude way to do what we wants that he does not care.
PLEASE ! the place is not worth the money (is not the cheapest, they don‚Äôt have water to offer and nothing around the neighbor), there are so many places a ""little"" more far away from the immigrations that are totally worth it !!!!
DON'T PUT YOUR HEALTH AT RISK !!!","Definitely not recommended. The dirtiest place I've been to in Bali - the room smelled of mustiness and dirt, with piles of dust and grime behind the bed and by the cabinets. The toilet and sink were unwashed, slimy, and it was evident that nobody had cleaned them with a cloth and cleaning chemicals for a long time. Under the shower, there was mold and mildew; all it took was crouching down to see the immense amount of mold - the shower clearly hadn't been cleaned since last year. Every countertop was dusty, and on top of that, it was very noisy at night, making it impossible to sleep, and we were given damp towels.","i wanted to love this place because of its strategic location and value for money, but i just couldn‚Äôt. photos from bookingcom are really different in the real life.

one thing i really noticed the first time i got here was, this place must have a problem with their sewage system because it stinks so bad even in the parking lot, which is a large open space. and it also stinks inside the room, especially in the bathroom.

the night i came here sheets were old and full of stains that i had to ask the staffs to change it. floor mat was also tore apart, they should just throw it away instead of putting it in the guest room.

the staffs here are helpful and friendly. but i kinda disappointed when they didn‚Äôt change the sheet and towel eventhough i told them to, and i even put the sign on it.","Not so good as on the pictures on booking websites
Was in the room downstairs.
Deside to change room from one side of building (shorter) to other (longer) cause In day time it is dark space with window too deep to have enough light in the room. In longer part of the building was more light in day time but at night time Light from the street strongly coming to the room through little windows up the wall.

Dirty bathroom like it is cleaned once a month.

Room is more little than it look like on a pictures.

Room is ok cleaned.",Location is good nearby campus and goverment institution. Also near Immigration office

We were the only customers and it was also our 3rd time & probably the last visit.

Originally i wanted to have the crispy chicken burger but unfortunately it was unavailable so i ordered chicken rice (which was edible & alright, but nothing special)

my girlfriend got the chicken parmigiana which was unfortunately inedible, literally stale and too much batter & dry!

Also to top it off what was the most annoying experience was we already mentioned we want to sit upstairs when we ordered the drinks & food the girl insisted we wait 5 minutes until she makes our coffeee so we can bring it up ourselves which makes no sense because she came upstairs twice to hand us sauce we asked for, she seemed friendly but very unreasonable even if the sign says ‚Äúpick up here‚Äù the waiters are still gonna bring the food to the second floor so why not bring it all together with the drink?!

Overall disappointing experience, spend your money else where!","Worth it for working space, good atmosphere, friendly staff, proper facilities, have meeting room and also delicious food and beverage.
Must comeback againü§©ü´µüèª",Best place to work from cafe and hangout with friends. Have a high speed internet and the most important things is smoking area.

The Croissant is the best here. Definitely your place to buy bread and cake. Parking is quite spacious inside the building and located in Renon.,"the service is very good!!!
I came here because I wanted financier, but it didn't meet my expectations. Beurre noisette in financier is not that noticeable, the texture is still okay and the price is not that expensive. The canele is delicious! I took away the salted caramel eclair but it was too sweet for me. I appreciate the security moved my table and chairs to a less hot/sunny area.",Well this little place situated in the heart of renon is really caught my attention with their ‚Äúparis like‚Äù enviroment. The parking lot is quite spacious and if you bring motorcycle its really nice when you can park it indoor. There is many selection of bread and pastry. The coffee is quite good.  The wifi is quite decent and piwered by biznet. This place is really good if you‚Äôre looking for fast internet and good selection of food. You can sit indoor or outdoor. The outdoor is not too hot because they provide a ceiling fan. This could be my new favourite coffee shop in denpasar. Its not hard to find it either.,"Outdoor is nice in the evening, limited seat in the Aircon area is too cold but good in day time. Pastries and cakes are excellent, bread isn't my cup of tea although they said it is daily production with longer expiration period. Their coffee comes in huge portion, a bit Watery and so not a strong one.",Your security is more attentive and friendly. He greeted us & welcoming with a smile.
