Their foods were GREAT!
Must try their Nasi Kulit (Chicken skin rice) and thank me later.
Food presentation was aesthetic too.
Their coffee was nice as well!","The service is excellent, one of the waitress help out to took some picture for me and my friends. She was so friendly. The pizza was amazing, you should try the chicken mushroom one. Will come back for sure!","Tea Point definitely had a good vibe in it. They have big windows in the 2nd floor, you can clearly see green soothing view outside. I came in rainy day, it was splendid afternoon..the rain, good choice of Playlist and warm tea. To sum it up, tea pot is a place with a nice vibe to chat on with friends or to do your work. The food is okay for me. The minus is they use plastic spoon and plastic glass even for dining in.","Love the vibe & food  ‚ù§Ô∏è
Good place to spend time with couple and friends","went there just for drinks. Tea was gernerous in a pot and delicious, coffee also good.

Upstairs seating offers volcano views when the weather is good.

The staff is very sweet - it started raining heavily and they fetched our helmets from the parking so they would stay dry."

Cold drinks & seriously great food. Yes its a cafe so no airs and graces but an absolutely delicious menu. Pricing that will not break the bank either. Great staff and hosts also to ensure you enjoy.,"We really enjoyed the food there. Indeed, the place was very pleasant and clean. The waitress was also super nice and polite with us. If we ever come again in this area of Bali, for sure we'll repeat!

Value for money is very good!","This restaurant is a gem. The food is great, the venue is clean and nice, the  service was perfect and the  price is affordable (maybe a bit noisy as the main road is nearby but it‚Äôs common in Indonesia). I would definitely recommend and I will go again for sur. I tried the Carbonara pasta and the crumble for dessert ü§åüèº","Cozy place, beef burger, chicken quesadillas, pizza, and apple pie was great, good services tho.

One word to describe this warung: fantastic!",Very nice service. The staff over here gives you very good recommendations and explains the food in a detailed way. Food itself was really nice we enjoyed the chicken dumplings and the jackarta‚Äôs noodles. Definitely reccomended,"Nice place, the service is good. I bought Mie Pangsit Special (if i'm not mistaken), it has noodle, sweet diced chicken and mushrooms, dumplings and meatballs. The noodles was light, easy to eat. Sweet chicken and mushrooms was good companion to complement savory broth and noodles. The dumplings is my favorite, must try. The meatballs surprised me, in general meatball's taste is in the savory side, but this one i can taste slightly sweet. I like it."
