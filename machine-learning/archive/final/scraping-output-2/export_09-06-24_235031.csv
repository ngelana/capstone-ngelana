There are four more rooms in the house in the compound and those travellers treated this serene place more like a hostel. But they were nice and quieted down once I asked them kindly to do so.
One of the rooms we booked was missing a fan. You should request one from the owner because the room gets quite stuffy.","Amazing and nice place to stay in case that look for an accommodation before Agung mountain trekking! As well if you are looking for a quite place! Close to the homestay you will find little shops enough to buy food and cook it in the shared kitchen of the homestay! If you want a restaurant there are two of theme around that serves local food. Besakih temple its 2km from there and it cost around 100.000 the entrance.
The owner its kind and helpful, always able to help you and taking care of you and your needs.
The room its so big with a private bathroom(heater included) with towels, brush teeth and soap. The mattress its so confortable! You have as well your private terrace and amazing views to Agung mountain!
I will stay there again so don’t hesitate and book a room there!
I’m sharing a video of the room!
Enjoy it!",Laundry team will come and take your clothes for cleaning.. You have a kitchen to cook food .. :) nice place to stay,"Very quiet and safe area. Local grocery and restaurant (50m away from Besakih Homestay & Villa) offered local price not tourist price. You could buy double for beers🍻🍺. Then enjoy in villa.
But villa didn't have air-conditioning. I was ok to stay because the weather was cloudy.",Bagus was a super good guy and very accomodating. He organised a scooter rental for me ans loaned me his poncho so I could climb Mnt Agung in the middle of the night. Highly recommend

Atmosphere was ver aesthetically pleasing and I'd love to come back and eat here if I ever visit here again. Waiters were nice too :) only problem is that it takes a while to get food but that's because it's right out the oven so it makes up for it. They say it's the best pizza in the village, but really it's one of the best in bali, only had one pizza better than this in Surabaya but that was expensive, this ones cheap. The toilet that has warm light is foul tho, has no trash can and you can't lock it the door you can wedge it and sink is um",Nice resto 👌 delicious food with cheap prices. We had lunch here before visiting Pura Besakih 🤗 My family like to eat here 👍 Recommended.,"The pasta was delicious, the Chicken fried rice was really good as well.
Price is very cheap and you get very good food.","nice place, amazing food!!
pizza and pasta is absolutely fine (i will not say italian ;))
staff is great and atmo is chilly.","After climbing 🧗🏼‍♀️ to Agung we come to this restaurant and eat good lunch 🥙. Price very good, food taste and cozy atmosphere 👍🏼 I take margarita pizza 🍕size is good, for me enough !!! 🤩 my wife take pasta 🍝 and French fries 🍟 also happen with choice ❤️‍🔥
We can recommend to visit this place!!! Enjoy your time and food here 🥰"

So helpful with everything. Great view of Agung from front yard. Kadek gave me the phone number of a climbing guide and left me to it.
For 2 nights stay I tried to pay more than he asked for which was less than I thought was reasonable","10minute drive from the start of the trail for Mount Agung. Kadek and his family were very nice and cooked dinner for me before the hike. They also gave me tea, bananas and clementines every morning.

The room was basic but very comfortable. A fan would be nice but it's not necessary. I did the hike solo but they can provide you with a guy if necessary. Best place to stay if you want to hike Agung!","KADEK VOLEUR

We spent a night at Kadek. The welcome was warm with fruit with fruit and hot drinks but it was to better coax us. With my friend we were looking for scooters and Kadek called his friend to provide us. The price was disproportionately high and the scooters in bad was (300 000km on the odometer and engine failure eb full running). This is just a glimpse of Kadek’s schemes. We left for the night trek of Mount Agung and Kadek heavily insisted and aggressively to keep the keys to our room. We had to raise our voice to keep the keys. Strange ... Speaking of the trek Kadek offered us bottles of water before the climb and charged us before leaving. The room is uncluttered at will: no air conditioning, no furniture, no blankets and holes in the wall since they let mosquitoes in. At the time of our departure, Kadek offered us a taxi service provided by another friend (Kadek runs the economy of the village). He made fun of Grab because of these competitive rates by ensuring that we would come back to him because the Grab do not pass in this region. Clever Kadek. He offered us 350,000 the first time to go to Padang Bai. When we came back because there was no Grab in this campaign, he demanded 400,000. After long negotiations, we finally accepted our will. Our stay at Kadek cost us a lot of money and we recommend you withdraw a nice sum before you go to this individual.

#kadekthief","Great views, great hospitality, great services, pak Kadek and ibu are the greatest!
They helped my friend to drive her to by pass road to get a gocar at night.
The rooms are clean, the place also so beautiful.","Friendly people, good kopi Bali, nice view, clean rooms, soft beds."

They are super friendly, the bikes are super nice. I loved the tracks to go to the Mount Batur. They have different level, so even if you re a beginner, you can have fun. Klx 250 are good for beginner, they have Pit bike for smaller person which a french design pit bike very strong. The KTM 300cc 2 stroke is a beast, recommend it, so much fun. One guy open, one guy close and they carry tools to fix whatever needs for you to enjoy! Try Rapah you wont be disappointed 😉","Crazy day of 🏜️,🌳 jungle & volcano🌋🏍️ riding!

I’ve been riding motorcycles for 20 years and I still can’t believe what paths we were able to “ride” on.

I had a full day of riding, it was just me and the tour guide, so it was a fully customized tour. We started in some sand track (pretty challenging for a beginner like me), afterward we drove through jungle tracks. The highlight was “riding” on black sand aka Volcano rocks and sand.

It’s a spot on the back of the volcano 🌋 where we stayed for maybe over 2 hours, at least that’s what it felt like. It was crazy!

We had lunch at the best restaurant I’ve been in in Indonesia on the way back. At the end of the day (2-3 pm) I was completely sore and exhausted.

I can highly recommend this place and would love to go again!","Great service, easy to clarify all info and book. At start you will receive complete riding gear and bike in good condition. Guys are friendly and help you on the track  whenever needed. As bonus they will make you some photos on your phone 🙂👍 Excelent highligh of my vacation to see Bali from dirt bike.","One of the best experiences you can have in Bali! Riding in the jungle was amazing. Rapah is the best guide you can have, he gives you all the signs and advice you need to ride in the unknown. I felt safe all along. Good equipment also. Will definitely do other dirt bike tours!","Amazing dirtbike tours! Rapah is both great guide and teacher. Bikes are in good condition, you can choose from many routes around Mount Agung region, and beyond. I did a multi-day trip to Amed and it was the best experience in Bali. Highly recommended 👍"
