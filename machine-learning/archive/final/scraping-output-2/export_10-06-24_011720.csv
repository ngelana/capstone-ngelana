First time in Bali this made me happy!

I like to stay a little bit outside from the center, so it was perfect. First pool in Bali that the water was clean.","I had a wonderful experience at Adhiloka last month. The staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating, making my stay truly enjoyable. The warm and welcoming atmosphere, coupled with the attentive service, created a positive and memorable environment. I appreciated the efforts of the staff to ensure a comfortable and pleasant stay. I look forward to visiting Adhiloka again in the future and would highly recommend it to others seeking a delightful and hospitable retreat.","One of my all time favourite places I‚Äôve stayed in Bali. We had the pool access room and absolutely loved it.
Staff were amazing in helping when my partner got sick and were always accomodating and helpful.
I can‚Äôt wait to come back.
They also created a beautiful romantic piece for our anniversary, free of charge.
Only downside is that it‚Äôs a little far from attractions, we used grab for food delivery and taxis.","It was what we expected out of the property.

The place is near to Uluwatu area where we have all the main tourist attractions. It is in an ideal location apart from some sounds of traffic passing by.

There is a supermarket very nearby. All the places we want to cover in Uluwatu are nearby. The property is clean and neat. It was raining both days we stayed there so couldn't use the pool.

Breakfast is Okay."

Great accommodation for solo traveler, couples or family because they have different types of rooms; dormitory, private bedroom and villa. I stayed in the mixed dormitory and it was amazing; clean, good ac, good wifi, have a quite large bathroom and also a drying rack to put your wet clothes in the terrace. They also have kitchen & dining table so you can cook & eat together with your roommates. The swimming pool also great! And the most important thing; the staffs are really amazing; very helpful and friendly. They‚Äôre so lovely! You can also rent a motorbike here with a good price! Motorbike condition is also good.

I will come back again to Mangga Wangga when i visit Bali, 100%üòçüåüüôå","I stayed in a dorm room for 8 nights, I had a wonderful time. Ungasan is in the middle of Uluwatu, so it's not very walkable but is a more affordable stay. Mangga Wangga was the perfect place to rest and socialize. The garden ambience and seating was lovely to enjoy, they have real grass, nice lights. I used the area for yoga and to read.

The kitchen was simple but enough. It was a place to socialize with other guests and staff. There's only a few dorm rooms and the rest is private, I try to find places like this because as a quiet solo traveler I want some social opportunity without any party scene. I get the perks of a more luxury stay like the garden and pool, on a budget.

Uluwatu is a surf/resort destination so most guests seemed to stay in at night.
Staff were so friendly and kind. Room and bathroom were cleaned daily, they even folded our bedding. The mattress was super super soft, same for the pillow - big fan. Can't recommend this place more!","We booked a private room on the first floor with (pool view) balcony. Amazing place to stay these nights! Quiet, peaceful, clean and lovely people (guests and staff). Speaking about the staff, always smiling, very helpful, working hard and the most friendly people I met during my stay in Bali. Due to this very nice experience I booked / extended my stay at Mangga Wangga for almost a month!","So glad I stayed there! Booked the dorm and was really worth the price! Lovely bathroom & common areas. They only have one dorm though, the rest of the property are private rooms so overall not very social but definitely good for solo traveller wanting to disconnect. Special mention to staff, they are really lovely.

NB they changed the mattresses while I was staying there so don't worry about those previous reviews, they've upgraded the beds:)","Black mold in the sink,  algae in the pool, and cockroaches scurrying across the floor are just a few issues.

Owners are nice, and good vibes,  but this place is a health and safety disaster."

Moreover the owner has the audacity to say that we need to vacate the place after we were checked in by the caretakers.

This newly opened coffee & eatery started  in July 2022. Located right on the main road to Uluwatu temple opposite the entrance gate of Pecatu Indah Resort (the way to Dreamland beach). Parking space good for some 20 motorbikes. Their street side signage is very visible, but no signage on the building. The place could fit about 25-30 people. Indoor area is two floors but  temporarily only ground floor is open, it is air-conditioned, the outdoor terrace for smoking area.
They offer house blend coffee made of Toraja & Flores. The quality of their coffee range is not only good‚Ä¶it‚Äôs great! Even better than to most of coffee shop in the same area. They also offer some meal for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The best part of it the staff are friendly and the price is considered cheap for such a great cup of coffee and eatery.

The coffee is absolutely delicious and the croissants are some of the best I've ever had. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. I have been a regular customer for months now and I have never been disappointed. A must-try for coffee lovers!,Very atmospheric and quiet place. Coffee is very good. Best place to work‚ù§Ô∏è

The owner grows & roasts the coffee beans, also blended tea leaves by himself and his wife bakes the most delicious Cranberry Pecan Pie!

we had a coffee cupping session (3 coffee beans - the West Java beans are very fruity and rich!) and a tea cupping session (3 tea leaves blend - the Chamomile and Turkish tea were splendid).

Thank you for the professional yet warm service, we‚Äôll be back soon!","You gotta check out this coffee shop! Their caramel frappe is legit perfect for hot weather. It's got that amazing caramel flavor that's so tasty, and they even throw in a scoop of ice cream on top! It's like a cool and creamy treat that hits the spot. Plus, the vibe in the coffee shop is super cozy and chill. It's the kind of place where you can just kick back and enjoy your frappe. Highly recommend giving it a try!

And! They have a skate park!!","Love the coffee!! i tried the coffee and tasted nice- balance, not overpowering the milk, not too acid and just perfect - no bitter aftertaste
You can smell the beans and choose which type of beans you want for your coffee!

Currently the skatepark still under construction, therefore the place not ideal. But they have indoor room with AC on and table - chairs. Good wifi too.
Will come back to try another coffee..","Amazing place for coffee enthusiast in Uluwatu area. The owner is really passionate about coffee. they roast their own beans. Tastes amazing. They have cupping 3 or 6 cups, so you can try a lot.

Their tea is also nice. very calming

Last but not least, the owner‚Äôs wife made her own pecan pie. it was amazing! it‚Äôs australian style with cranberry. very light and tasty

definitely recommend you guys to try!","Very lovely out of the way coffee shop. Plenty of space to relax under a grass hut environment. An oasis out of the heat, nice breeze is coming through. Jazz music playing in the background. Very delicious coffee and pastries. Excellent customer service. I highly recommend it."
