All this almost 24 hours a day. We had a trip to Ijen and listened to this instead of sleeping. The staff was rather lax about it and offered us a move only at the end of our stay. In addition, we found a total of 3 cockroaches in the room and the bathroom, however, the accommodation is in nature, so we would forgive this. We tried the food once and chose nearby restaurants on other days. It was a really bad experience for us.","Tucked away in a quiet village you'd never guess such luxury and ridiculously cheap!
Best pool we experienced in Bali with such comfy pavilions I fell asleep. Deck lounges, bean bags.
Natural hot spring tub.
Gorgeous view to mountains across a vineyard.
Very laid-back but present staff.
Lovely small, family vibe.
Restaurant and bar on site.
Terrific and cheap masseuse also did my nails.
Scooter available.
Very chill.","Very clean room and clean area...  We love the pool and the view is very green and you able to see volcano from the restourant area....
Really recommend this places","Fantastic place, super clean and beautiful. AC in rooms, hot spa on site and there is even a vinyars on site. The view is great and the people that run it are very friendly and inviting. I would also recommend the massage! Will definitely be back!","A villa located in Pejarakan, Buleleng. The place is very nice, they have swimming pool and hot pool as well. The room is clean, the bed is comfy, the bathroom is nice too. But my door couldnâ€™t slide very well so I couldnâ€™t lock it at night. The staffs are very nice, also nice enough to take me to the beach with motorcycle because there is no public transportation / g*jek available in the area. I wouldâ€™ve given this place a 5-star if not for the breakfast, I think the flavor & seasoning can be improved more. Otherwise, Iâ€™m satisfied with my stay and would recommend to others."

Sila and his wife did everything to make my stay the best. He arrange my snorkling trip and hiking trip. His Sister and niece came around and did mani & pedicure.. absolutely fantistic. The food was to die forðŸ˜‹ The sate with peanut sauce...OMG.. you could hear the Angels sing..
My highest recommendations to this little homestay and I would not hesitate to come back","Me and my girlfriend had one of the two bungalows in the garden : really comfortable and nicely made (new but authentic architecture style with local materials). The bungalow has a wonderful private outdoor shower with plants!! Great idea. It's a country side atmosphere, surrounded by farmers families, vegetable gardens, fruit trees, chickens and cattles. Plus, there is a cool rooftop where you can have your breakfast and enjoy the rising sun.","lovely little homestay in the middle of a small Balinese village. rooms are clean, beds comfy and the small pool refreshing. most delightful: the family are such friendly and helpful hosts, their homemade food so delicious ... I really can recommend this place","Such a great experience. Kadek & his family are wonderful hosts. The room was clean and cozy. The bed was really comfortable and had a mosquito net. Air conditioning meant it was always pleasant and easy to sleep. Though advertised as just a room, it's actually a small bungalow. It has a private bathroom that's mostly open to the sky.

Nothing was too big or small to request, from an extra bottle of water, to organising a motorbike at a great price or snorkelling trip with pickup at the door.

The breakfast was basic but they will try to meet your requests. The lunch and dinners were also tasty, though we mostly ventured out for other great choices nearby.

We look forward to visiting again","It's really great place with very lovely little cottages. Really nice people and good service, clean and beautiful rooms with all the things you need. Bed was excellent for good sleep, breakfast really tasty and the owner very helpful."

The staff were very helpful and friendly. The location is a little remote but there is a shop selling basics up the road. Breakfast was good and so was the evening food we ordered. The shower in our room wasnâ€™t the best and needs looking at. But overall Iâ€™d stay again and recommend.,"Slightly hard to find but great value accommodation, comfy bed and amazing hosts who go that little bit extra to give you 5 star service. We got a good night message with fresh petals which was a nice touch.",Beautiful and peaceful place. Owner is quite friendly. It's next to a foot of a hill . Beautiful view and beach is not to far . May be 10-15 min walk will take u to beach . Nearest tourist attraction would be snorkeling point and turtle conservation. Only down side is food will not be available after 8 pm. Fill ur tummy by night fall.WiFi is bit slow . Recommend place would come again.,"We had a great stay at Menjangan Sari, the family that runs the place are extremely nice and helpful. The rooms are good, the service is excellent.","It was comfortable place to stay, I fell like a home here, the serve was great and nice."

They took us to a traditional dance ceremony in the village, which was so special to see. The rooms are very clean and up to date. The garden is lovely and green, you can use the pool from the hobbit house which is just next door. They arranged a scooter upon arrival for us. Breakfast was lovely! Perfect place to stay if you like a combination of village life and being close to places like pemuteran, or menjangan island!","Restful location, excellent service, beautiful rooms, simple but delicious breakfast. I really enjoyed this home stay near Menjangin. It's conveniently situated half way between pemuteran and Menjangin park. Scooter is not required but highly suggested.

White sand beach perfect for sunsets about 10 minutes away. City and park 10-15 minutes away. Possible to order your meals here or eat down the street at the Hobbit house.

Staff is very friendly and helpful. Owner has good English and responds quickly/easy with WhatsApp. Unbeatable value.","Amazing place, wonderful owner, best snorkelling ever! I'm dreaming to come back!","Great place to stay, feels like staying in my grandma's house hehehe...","Really2 exotic.
Nice place to get rest."

We came for dinner at 6:30pm and the family seemed unsure about serving us. There was no menu so we were offered fish or chicken. We chose the fish. The food took a very long time, which we were okay with, as we were the only people eating dinner. There was another backpacker eating sweet crepes who was staying at the accommodation.
The fish was curried with a small amount of rice and sambal on the side. The food was really nice, but the price at the end was the most we have ever been charged in Bali!!

5 stars because the food was nice and the family accommodated us when no one else was there for dinner. If you are on a budget though, like we were, ask for the prices upfront.
Two plates fish, rice, sambal
One large Singaraja beer
Two small Bingtang
IDR 270,000",Great cooked fish and delicious coconut pancakes ! Great and really friendly family to host,"The food is really tasty, affordable prices and nice staff!",Good food good priceðŸ˜‰,
