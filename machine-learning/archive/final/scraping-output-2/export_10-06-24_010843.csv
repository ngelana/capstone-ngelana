It quite easily offers some of the best views from Nusa Penida, and the atmosphere and design of the restaurant itself is like stepping into a dream. There's soft, warm lighting cascading down every level of lawn and garden from the bustling bar and dining area, and the cool glow from the infinity pool overlooking the ocean. (Yes-- infinity pool. And yes, patrons are welcome to enjoy a refreshing dip at any time during their visit)! If that wasn't breathtaking enough you'll surely be captivated by the AMARTA Gate of Heaven! It's the perfect opportunity to capture beautiful memories in a truly stunning setting.
As if there weren't enough reasons to visit, AMARTA boasts an impressive and varied menu for a quality fine-dining experience. Personally, my favorite is the Pan Seared Salmon-- every succulent bite is expertly seasoned and always cooked to perfection. Don't miss out on the French Fries, either! I believe the fries serve as proof that the chef believes in making EVERY part of their menu flavorful and exciting, and doesn't skimp on the details üòÄ
Last but not at all least--a big thank you to the lovely wait staff that I met during my visits! I always felt that I was being welcomed back by friends, and I will look forward to seeing them again soon üíó",It was a terrific vibe and terrific place to hang out with friends or family. I was surprised how tasty the food was. You can hangout in the pool with drinks. We ended up eating there 3 times in 2 days. Great views of the ocean from the pool and table.,"What an extraordinary place! What a view, and sunset from the pool ! The service is great, prices are good and we had also the chance to have a happy hour on cocktails. The food we tried after was also good, price quality ! Thanks for the experience","What a place!!
We‚Äôve stayed closed by in a cottage and randomly came across this location.
We
Came back everyday from our stay in Nusa Penida.
The pool, the view, the amazing sunset.
The fantastic tasteful food! We‚Äôve tried the pizza‚Äôs, the pastas and and the fish and chips.
Everything is made with passion and love and is so tasteful!

The service is amazing, so professional and very friendly personal.
The place is clean and has been thought through in every detail.

For the service, the view and the food the price is good, unlike other day- or beachclubs.","We stayed on the island for 2 nights, and this was the best place for us. The sunset is just AMAZING! It's totally worthy and nice. The pool is clean, and the view is another level.
Delicious food and a friendly environment. The workers are so nice and kind, especially Mr Kadek, who gave us a very good welcome to the place and made us feel very comfortable. At the same time, we really want to say thank you to Utari because she gave us a very good service, super friendly and kind. Keep going like that guys!!! Thank you so much! We 100% recommend this place.
See you!!!!! üáßüá∑üá®üá¥üáÆüá©"

Hotel serves dinner also, which can be bought at a very reasonable price. Rooms are very comfortable. Loved it!","The rooms are basic but clean and cover all the essentials. The view from the swimming pool area was beautiful and the service made it even better! Location was good though you'll need a car to get here. If taking a scooter, please be careful with the small roads and potholes.",Accommodation is basic but this is as to be expected on NP so just embrace it! Bed was nice and firm and the aircon works a treat. Views are second to none and staff are awesome! Road is bumpy as all hell but again this is just the island. I recommend the banana pancakes and a dragonfruit juice for breakfast :) make sure to vent your bathroom when it‚Äôs not raining so the damp can clear out üôè,Great place! Hidden gem! Our driver brought us here after a day exploring the west side of the island. We watched the sunset while hanging in the pool. We immediately received towels. Food was also very good. This place Canberra missed.,"The road to the accomodation is horrible but once arrived the view will be amazing!

We checked in and got to the room, room and bathroom are big but once you shower there is a weird smell coming from the bathroom, probbaly not venting the bathroom causes this.
There also was no mirror in the bathroom so everytime i had to go into the room to check.

The light buttons are at the far side of the room, no buttons near the entrance..

But the pool and the view are just amazing. Also the kitchen is really good here!"

Just stunning. The cottage itself has everything you need, beds atlre very comfortable.

Breakfast was OK, but lacked vegan options.

We stayed 3 nights and one night there was an electricity and water problem which was fixed the next day.

As the cottages are in nature, it's quite a bumpy road to get there & it's perfect for nature lovers with the sound of nature.

Note that there are quite a few cute dogs coming from the nearby villages.

Overall we loved our stay. Thank you Made for your hospitality.","A really wonderful place to be, a hidden gem of nusa penida. Beautiful people warmly welcomed us and made everything easy to enjoy a full weekend. Everything is carefully designed to accommodate you in the best way possible. Situated away from noise or the main road, one can be delighted by the beautiful scenery as seen from the infinity pool opening up towards the landscapes of nusa penida.","Batan Sabo Cottage in Nusa Penida is a no-frills gem that offers clean and essential accommodations for travelers seeking a comfortable stay. While it may not have all the bells and whistles, the units are spacious and equipped with exactly what you need, making it an ideal base for your island adventures.

What sets this property apart is the owner's dedication to constant improvement and expansion. It's clear they are committed to enhancing the guest experience, which is always a good sign.

It's worth noting that Batan Sabo Cottage is located a short 12-20 minute scooter ride away from the main restaurant areas. While this may require a bit of travel, it's a small trade-off for the peace and tranquility you'll find at the property.

I'd like to commend the front desk team for their assistance in coordinating transportation and keeping our room neat and tidy. Their dedication to ensuring a comfortable stay was much appreciated.

If you're looking for a clean and comfortable no-frills accommodation in Nusa Penida, Batan Sabo Cottage is an excellent choice.
