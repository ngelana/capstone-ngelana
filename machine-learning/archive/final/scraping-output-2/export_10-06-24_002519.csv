We noticed it was very cheap and beautiful (perfect right?) no, it was so dirty! Sheets with stains, shower not clean, everywhere ants and last but not least:

I thought I saw bed bug eggs. So I immediately asked someone to double check. The staff told me not to worry and that it came from the wood. I took their word for it and went into town to do our thing. Finally, someone told me that it was termites that remove the sawdust from the wood. It was everywhere, in the mattress, furniture and, on the floor. A little wouldn't be a big deal but this looked like a plague.

In addition to everything, there were also cockroaches and mice that we saw, inside and outside the house. That was a sign for us that we did not want to sleep here. They offered us another house but we didn't want it. Luckily the man was kind enough to cancel our booking. We don't think they even realize they have a termite infestation because again, they said it was the wood. Which is correct, but not because the wood ""leaves"".","Unfortunately, my experience at this hotel was a complete nightmare.
From cockroaches invading our privacy by dining on my toothbrush, loud noises from anywhere, to dirty sheets, spider webs as extra decor, and even a repulsive brown drip, which we discovered was sewage from the upstairs bathroom, leaking into ours. The only thing deserving recognition here are the staff members, who bravely endure unacceptable conditions with professionalism. However, it's disheartening to witness such lack of hygiene and care for guest comfort.
A truly regrettable experience.","Really surprised by this place, as wasn‚Äôt expecting much as it was so cheap. But really nice place! The rooms were in little wooden huts with balconies. My room was a little noisy from the family below, but when I informed reception they instantly moved me to another room. Staff were also lovely!","Good facilities and spacious bathroom with bathtub. Hot water is enough powerful to fills tub.
Safety box, the kettle, the dryer and fridge. Reasonable price but we'll equipped.
As Location is far away from town center, country side feeling and not so developed good area.
One thing I cannot relax is bangalow buildings are too close each other.
Staffs are very wise and caring, overall good hotel.","If you want to sleep, dont come to this place. There‚Äôs light in the room at 6am and everyone makes so much noise. You can hear literally everyone in the area and if you are in the first floor, you‚Äôll hesr every single step and whisper from the second floor. Unpleasant experience. The toilet is dirty."

Waking up to such greenery, sipping coffee in the verandah with rice field surrounding you.
However, the bathroom needs improvement. Hot water only runs in the bathtub. Also, another business is building their cottages near this resort. It causes some noise. Those cottages also block the rice field view from the room and swimming pool.",Great place surrounded with rice fields! They can provide filling breakfast with a little amount if you have sort time in Ubud and dont want to waste time eating outside. Only problem is you can hear your neighbours. Spa is next to the room and we woke up with massage noices.,"We cancelled our stay and left in couple of hours after check in. Please note that you will have to carry your luggage over many stairs and pebbles yourself. Wooden stairs into the units are simply held by nails that can come off any minute. We almost fell over thrice over the rocks carrying our luggage. No help was offered. Room had lot of gaps in roof making air-conditioning pointless and has lot of spiders on the bed.

On the contrary after few negotiations they only charged half day stay for 1 hour ""use""of room.  View was nice. Food is pricey but very tasty and fresh as well. Service lady had good smile always when dealing with problems",the rice field view from the balcony was so niceüòçüòç the friendly staffs and foods were amazing! would love to come stay again!,"The rooms are not good at all, the rest rooms are smelling because the construction is not good. No isolation, we can hear the neighbours like we were in the same room.
The description of our room said that we have a private hot tub and it was just the bath of the shower in the smelly toilet...
The picture of the booking and the reality are far away.
The stairs of the swimming pool are corroded and loose, also the toilet itself.
I don't recommend to come here at all."

In addition, it‚Äôs worth noting that we didn‚Äôt dine at the hotel during our stay. While my wife sampled the food a couple of times, she didn‚Äôt particularly praise it. However, this didn‚Äôt detract from our overall positive experience.",Beautiful place for villas and bungalows where you can fill homely to spend your holidays with your family.

But the rooms are not well maintained ‚Äî it does not look like the picture anymore.  The bathrooms can use better cleaning, they smell funky and the towels are tattered.

There is a pigsty next door so it smells like poop a lot of the time when you are walking outside.  It‚Äôs especially bad if you get one of the rooms that has an outside bathroom.  While the bathroom itself looks nice ‚Äî you can smell the pigs as you bathe. Yuck!

The internet is super spotty, most of the time, there is none ‚Äî and when it shows up, it‚Äôs super slow.

Honestly, you can find much better places for the price they are asking for.","Beautiful hotel in the middle of rice fields, rooms are spacious, with shower and stone bathtub, perfect for honeymooners, quiet area, perfectly surrounded by paddys fields.

I was eager to review The Arcadian mere minutes after our checkout, and for all the right reasons.

This venue stands out as possibly the best we've ever experienced. Much of its charm is attributed to the staff, whose exceptional service and attentiveness elevate the stay. Their commitment to guests truly sets this place apart.

Our accommodation, 'The Keep', was a testament to thoughtful design, where every detail was meticulously crafted. A highlight of our stay was the delightful floating breakfast, which we wholeheartedly recommend.

Located a convenient 10-minute drive from the bustling center of Ubud, The Arcadian offers the best of both worlds: proximity to town and the tranquility of the surrounding rice fields. We took advantage of the scooter rental service they offer, making our explorations all the more convenient.

We were particularly impressed by the prompt responses from the staff via WhatsApp, often receiving instantaneous replies.

Having been privileged to stay at numerous esteemed venues globally, The Arcadian ranks among the very best.

A heartfelt thank you to the team at The Arcadian for a memorable stay!"

We ordered some massages and they do not have a specific place for it so they did it in our room or by the pool deck. The villa has a great selection of services such as, drivers, scooter rental, lots of tours and massages. Better to double check prices as not everything is all-inclusive in the tours.

Good choice from my customer.
Lobby are clean, Indonesia breakfast friend noodle are great my customer said. Hope it Will be great experience for my customer üôèüôè","Amazing stay here. Mainly this review is about the hotel staff, they are gem. Highly recommended.","First:  The name of the hotel is the same as the one that is only a few meters away from Downtown.  So, I will let you guess what is going on here.
Second, Given that this site is remote and in an isolated place, the personnel are constantly trying to book you with the network drivers. They are pretty insistant.  If you manage to get other means of travel... they show their dissatisfaction.  If they discover who you took personal arrangements with, they will call the driver and threaten if they choose to pick you up.
Third,  there menu is pretty limited... and over that, some items ont the menu are only available randomly... limiting even more.
I did not feel confortable in this remote and reclusive place.","Lovely villas with the perfect location: only 10 min away from the city centre and in between rice fields, being away from the noisy and busy Ubud. Plus, the staff is very attentive and careful, the place is always clean and well taken care of and the breakfast is prepared everyday at your request. Definitely recommend!"

The hosts are really nice and willing to help with any necessity you may have. You can also rent a scooter with them, very handy! And breakfast was delicious! Check my pics to see how the room was. Recommended, great value.","We found this gem here in Booking and we were very happy we booked it. The owner was a great host since the beginning and the room was of excellent value. We had a nice breakfast every morning and the swimming pool to refresh after a visiting day in Ubud. They rented us a scooter for a very good price and with it we were in downtown in around 7 minutes. They take care of the property and the guests. I recommend it very much if you want to stay in a quiet place and close enough to Ubud.
I would recommend to the owner to try to keep voices lower as some guests could be still sleeping early in the morning. Sometimes we could people just talking without consideration, but not every morning though.",Great cheap place to stay. Need to hire a scooter as it's a bit north of Ubud center. There are 4 villas/ rooms and a pool. Wik the guy who runs the place couldn't do enough for us and the scooters he rented us were the cheapest and best quality scooters we've ever had in Bali. There are three villas in a row and then one on its own across the way. I recommend getting one of the three that are side by side if you can. The pancakes I got for breakfast here were some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The location is North of Ubud centre near paddy fields which is exactly what we wanted cause Ubud centre is so hectic. Highly recommend this place.,"Everything was perfect. The room and the bath was clean. The shower had hot water. There is a pool which is cleaned daily which is nice. Free breakfast which was delicious and included fresh fruits. The owner is super friendly and helpful. They rent scooters for an affordable price. The location is great if you ride a scooter, it's more quite than in the center of Ubud but you can get there within 10 minutes. There is a waterfall and the Rice fields within the same distance. It's a bit far from the center if you want to walk, but the traffic is far less than in Ubud center so I can recommend renting a scooter. We wanted to get out if the chaotic center and still enjoy the perks of Ubud, that's exactly what we got. The owner also organized a transfer to our next stay which was for a great price and work out fine. All in all a great experience and very recommendable if you get around with a scooter."

Finding a good accommodation wasn't as easy as I thought, a lot of them look great on pictures but when you arrive there are usually not kept well and there is a problem with mold or cleanliness. But Villa Merdu was spot on! All the way from the location, cleanliness, amazing stuff and sooooo much space, just wow!
I was able to fully relax, use my time to read, do yoga and meditate since it is so quite, with the most beautiful jungle pool view. The whole villa is really spacious, nicely and what's more important practically furbished with everything you might need during your stay.
