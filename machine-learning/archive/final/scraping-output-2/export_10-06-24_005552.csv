ChIJ655Aqy0T0i0R0jUR9F8anwY,The Secret Spot Villas,-8.5745396,115.41960870000001,"CCG9+5RQ, Jumpai, Klungkung, Klungkung Regency, Bali, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=477129084943545810,OPERATIONAL,+62 821-4436-0802,lodging,lodging,4.7,50,,"The room was nice and it's nice to hear the waves crashing. However, there's so much that tainted the experience. Firstly, the room was not ready so we had to wait 20 minutes for them to clean it (and then they blamed us for a lost TV remote which we never knew existed to begin with...). The beach had litter between the sandy area and the villa so you had to walk through that first to get to the beach, the location is lovely but not for any deliveries, with Grab drivers turning down orders multiple times and the only ones saying for a big tip as they had to travel so far to deliver anything. To top it off, the breakfast brought severe food poisoning (an hour later) where the hotel staff got incredibly defensive and threatened to report to authorities. There are some lovely hotels, resorts and villas in Bali. I can safely say I would never go back to this place again.","Just book! This place is incredible! It’s waterfront on a rare Black Sand Beach and it is the most relaxing place! It’s on the coast so you can get a car to ferry to the other islands.

It’s gorgeously decorated and the pool is fantastic. It only hosts four rooms at a time so don’t wait around!

FYSA: Ask the hotel to pick you up from the airport. It’s only $30 and it will relieve your stress of finding a ride in the crowded airport. Grabs can be easily booked to get around.","Secret Spot Villas is a slice of heaven! So relaxing and without fault. The staff are amazing, food is delicious! I recommend the seafood (for 2) & pork (for 2) - yummmmm. Order the day before to allow the staff to prepare - you will not be disappointed.
Arrangements can be made for day trips and the cool pool awaits you on your return.
Villas are spacious and very comfortable.
Escape the hustle and bustle and relax at Secret Spot Villas ☺️","WoW WoW WoW!
Where should i start.
The staff: absolutely amazing! Everyone is just so friendly and caring.
You feel at home with the first minute.
They take care, arrange whatever you need and make sure you have an amazing experience.
The Location: fantastic by the black sand beach, super nice and quite area.
The setting: very cozy and clean villas with a nice pool and several spots to chill and hang out.
Only thing to recommend is to have a car or a bike in order to move around.
Thank you so much for this amazing 10 days and this beautiful experience!
Komang Julia & Kadek Ivan","Every detail of the Villa oozes luxury. From the beachside pool, plush King sized bed and the authentic Balinese cuisine produced by the chef! Tucked away from the busy cities, This villa in Jumpai is the perfect place to unwind, with massages by the beach plus a driver to take you to all the local sights. You can choose to venture out and explore the sights of Bali or spend your time relaxing at the Villa. I loved the outside showers and baths which made us feel like we were in a Pantene advert! The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated. All the staff are attentive and super friendly. The management is professional. There is nothing like returning from a day of sight seeing with freshly made beds, washed clothes, brilliant air con and plenty of Bintang and food to fill your belly! We were sad to leave and say goodbye to the staff! But I know we will definitely return! Best Bali experience I could of hoped for :)"
