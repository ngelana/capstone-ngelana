ChIJEd0t4X070i0RumqPJL4XWJw,The Backyard House,-8.5671951,115.141677,"Tanjung Bungkak, Kediri, Kec. Kediri, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82121, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=11265780573291899578,OPERATIONAL,+62 877-6320-8061,,lodging,4.6,47,,Staying in the backyard house is always a pleasure. Yoga and his family make you feel like at home and they are very helpful with any questions you may have. It‚Äôs a perfect budget place to stay out of busy areas and experience a more local vibe!,"An inviting and comfortable space, perfect for those who appreciate peace and tranquility (quiet). The showers are delightful, offering the option of both hot and cold water. The owners, Yoga and Ayu, are exceptionally kind and friendly. Overall, excellent value ‚Äì a solid 5-star experience.","It was an amazing experience the owner was welcoming to all his guests very caring humble and helpful. The location was perfect for peace and quiet area. I was amazed because I was close to a gym, spa and a night market. Everything was amazing so if you want a peace quiet away from the hustle and bustle of the city life atmosphere I highly recommended it.","I booked here with yoga and family for one month but ended up leaving after 3 weeks. The rooms are very small and there is no furniture and not much anywhere to put your belongings so it‚Äôs hard to keep the place really tidy. Also the interior is brick wall and it kinda smell‚Äôs especially after you have had a shower because there is no ventilation at all in the small space. Staying here for one or two days would be ideal if you want to save but if your going to do long term, I would pay that extra couple of bucks for that extra comfort. Yoga and family are really nice people they will help you as much as they can.","This is my first time in Bali and I was recommended this place. Very kind and responsive hosts, will always help, support and tell about culture.

The place is ideal for travelling, 20 minutes to Canggu and 20 minutes to Ubud (if there are no traffic jams). Also it‚Äôs very quiet place.

You can meet local and communicate with people from different countries.

I‚Äôm just in love with this place! ü§ç"
