Taditional Indonesian food, more of Chinese-Indonesian food. But HALAL food

Have a very nice and polite staff.
Good place to eat, whether you choose to dine in or taking out.

You must try their chinese fried rice, teh tarik, sapo tahu, their signature dish mak jo fried rice, chicken noodles, etc.

Fish is dammm good","Had dinner here, reccomend the fried chicken with the salty egg sauce shown in the image. The flavours just blends well and match it with some chilli sauce for a slight jazz. Didn't have avocado juice which I loved but had sweet ice tea instead which is shown in the image. The price is fine but the atmosphere is outdoor style so expect warm and humidity. Only had it with dinner so darker image is shown.

Went a second time and now got a black pepper beef with some veggies covered in sweet mayonnaise. Again tasted very nice the beef has that strong pepper taste with the veggies and mayo is just too good. Portioning wise still good.

Third time update got a fish soup packet which is nice. The fried fish was cooked well and the fish in the soup had a descent proportion. The soup tasted a little too salty but other than that it is still good."

It is located away from the main street what makes it still quiet, but close enough to it that you are at walkable distance from any place in that main street.
You can book massages and rent a scooter directly in the hotel.

Lots of Warungs, supermarkets, ATMs, massage places, markets around and you get a very local experience. Simply amazing!

What a good heart owner Mama Chew, God Bless Your Kindness.
I will be back one day!

*price are quite high, just make sure you have budget above $200 for a dinner for two people*","This has to be the hidden gem in Bali! Chanced upon Mama Chew when I was researching on seafood dinner at Jimbaran. Tried a few places in previous trips along Jimbaran Bay but nothing beats this rooftop experience!
Just meeting the wonderful lady owner, Figie, was in itself worth the trip there! Had the privilege to chat with her after our awesome dinner and found out that she started this restaurant about 7 years back. One of our main reason for patronising this restaurant, apart from the most splendid reviews from all the past customers, was the fact that Figie's staff are all deaf/mute. After hiring these staff, Figie challenged herself to learn their sign language in order to communicate faster and more efficiently with them. The service by her staff during our dinner was absolutely seamless and in fact, we felt pampered by their eager attentiveness and our limited sign language seem sufficient.
As this is a restaurant, it has to ultimately still be judged on the food. Coming from Singapore to try out Mama Chew's highly acclaimed Singapore Black Pepper & Chilli Crab, my wife and I were definitely not disappointed! We wanted to try all her specialty that I thought I over-ordered. In the end, we cleaned up every single dish and washing down with 2 large bottles of iced cold Bintang beers!
Our experience was simply heavenly and extremely satisfying. To meet the lovely Ms. Figie in person really tops it all! It is always very heartening to see good people doing good and spreading joy & love! Hope more people would go to support & at the same time enjoy this out-of -this world dining exeperience at Mama Chew in Bali!  Well done Figie & team!","For crab lovers, this place is the best in bali to eat singapore style crab cuisine. The restaurant is actually a top floor of a house, with some creative design and ornaments.","Whilst on holiday in Bali. We found Mama Chews on the trip advisor best Bali restaurants.   It is a solely seafood experience and specialises in crab. Making a booking was easy via email or via What‚Äôs App.  You are sent a menu two days prior to your booking.  You choose your dish and let the management know.   You are also advised that it is a bring your own wine restaurant but you can get the local beer BINTANG supplied.  It is also a cash only business
The restaurant is out of the way and you will need to clarify with your driver before you go that he knows where to go.  We stayed in Seminyak and our trip cost us $20 Australian dollars. Took about 70 minutes in Bali traffic.  I also advise you to make arrangements for your  return trip home
The restaurant is on the roof top of her house.  When you arrive you are greeted by Madan Chew.  (Figie). She is a genuine lady who is engaging with you from the outset. She is proud of her establishment and shows you her kitchen and how she looks after all her crabs.  They are imported from New Guinea and she keeps every one seperate in water boxes to make sure they are as fresh as possible.
You are escorted up stairs by her and her staff member.  All her staff a young females from the area who are deaf. She supports them by employing them and giving them purpose.
The roof top has a 270degree view after the area which is just fantastic.  You are seated and served with drinks.
Our first course was the best fried rice that I have ever eaten.  It was simply mouthwatering.  Served on a platter and was a very decent serving for two.
Our main course was Singapore chilli Crab and Caramelised crab.  Again. One of the best meals I have ever had.  Apart from the fun of using the pliers to crack the crab. It just tasted Devine.  Melt in your mouth cuisine at its best.  To think that this dish is prepared in a semi industrial kitchen is something to behold.
There is no rush when you are there.  Only 3 or 4 tables in the establishment.
A great ambiance where you can take in the view and have a great conversation.
Before you leave read all the great comments on the black board running all the way down the stairs.  Then wrote your own comment before you leave.
Mama Chew is a beautiful lady who cares about her food and how it comes to you. She wants your evening to be memorable.
If you like seafood.   It is a must go to when in Bali.","Words are deficient to share about my experience at the restaurant. My family was warmly welcomed by the hospitality of the owner and her staffs. In addition, food is delicious with resonable price. Highly recommend for your family dinner, but ensuring your appointment before coming. To me, I will be back here in my upcoming trips in Bali."
