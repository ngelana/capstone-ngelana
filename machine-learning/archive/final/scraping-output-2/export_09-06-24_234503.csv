A hidden gem of tranquility and natural beauty of Bali. Bapak Wayan and his son Surya went out of their way to make my stay comfortable including cooking up delicious local food. This is a place to simply retreat with options for soft trekking and visit to peaceful Batukaru Temple.
Loved waking up with the birds and the view. Will be back. üôè","Only 20mn away from Jatiluwih, a beautiful place lost in nature. The owner and his son are absolutely lovely, and the 3 accommodations are beautiful, built by the owner himself. A lovely place to wake up to singing birds in a stunning landscape. On arrival, keep following the stones for a while to arrive to the lodge.",Amazing experience...recommended,"Nice place to relax, amazing garden with their own fruits that you can try, bed was very confortable, what you get for what you pay is really worthy. We have spent 3 days to visit the most important temples, lake and rice terrace around the area.

You feel like in your own home. I will come back!",
