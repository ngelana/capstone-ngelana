Wonderful staff, lovely room with a great view. Monkeys were a nice treat to have some entertainment. The massage room up at the top probably has one of the best views in the area. Only flaw would be the water not  being a free thing, there should be a at least a community 19L jug for everyone to fill from. Or just get water filters for the taps so people can drink from the tap.",This resort was nice. The service was really good. They had a shuttle service to the beach 5-10mins way as well as massages. We had a massage which was at the terrace of the building which was very enjoyable and it had a good view. It was breezy as well. The room was nice with a garden. The only thing that i didn't like was that there was no air circulation in the bathroom because there was no window there. Other than that it was all good. There was a pool but i don't use it because we went to the beach,"We were repeatedly lied to and tricked. Do not stay here. We booked a 2 bedroom villa with pool for our last week in Bali as a splurge. We arrived and the hotel told us the room was not safe as the wind had damaged the roof. They gave us two regular rooms and said we could have the villa the following day. We asked for a discount for the night as the price of the villa is double the room
Price and they said the best they could do was a discount on the baby cot we needed which was also going to be $170 Canadian for the week ‚Ä¶ most hotels it‚Äôs included.

The next morning I asked to move to our villa and they said it was still not safe. As the resort is small I went to look myself only to find both villas occupied by other families. When we confronted them they lied AGAIN. Finally admitting yes they double booked the Villas. They then blamed it on Agoda having a website glitch. We contacted Agoda who had no idea about any of this and they tried to contact the hotel
For 2 hours. Finally we packed booked another place and left Agoda to deal with their lying. They tried to charge us $170 for our one night stay saying it was a private transaction even though the 7 nights was fully paid on agoda. They said the cost of the normal
Room we stayed in was $170 but online it showed it as $65. We lost count of how many times we were lied to. We are happily in another resort with a refund from Agoda. If it were not for the lying we may have stayed. However food was okay, there is nothing around and you need to shuttle to the beach. We had to have Gojek deliver baby milk. I do not recommend staying here with a young family.","Great resort with amazing staff. We stayed here for five days and it was the right choice. It is quiet and peaceful. The resort counts with all sorts of amenities. Again lovely staff and I would most definitely be coming back.
The one little thing I wanna say is the lobby has the same song in a loop, if I was working there it would drive me nuts.","Guests who stay here get free access and free shuttle(drop off and pick up) to the nearest beach, Pantai Pandawa. Employees are great and super friendly. They cleaned the room when i was having breakfast without me knowing it(super fast) and their laundry service is fast, clean and very affordable considering it's a very touristy place."

Despite not having high expectations due to the affordable price of the room, we still expected cleanliness. However, the room fell short in this aspect. We found a pair of underwear from previous guests under the bed, and the bed itself was extremely uncomfortable, feeling like a sagging waterbed where every movement of your partner can be felt. Additionally, due to the open structure of the accommodation, there were numerous insects in the room, including ants, mosquitoes, centipedes, and spiders.

However, the worst part was the toilet, which still had brown stains. The towels did not smell fresh, but rather musty. Although the staff was attentive, their English language skills were in need of improvement.

The only redeeming qualities were the decent breakfast and the option to rent a scooter for 70Idr. The accommodation is very secluded and off the beaten path.",Great value at this resort. It's a little dated but I stayed in a deluxe double room and it was so spacious. Good breakfast and friendly staff. I will definitely return.,"Out of the busy ara, 30 min with the bike to all the beautiful beaches, super nice and lovely staff, breakfast included, possible to do laundry, massage, rent a bike :)

Service was incredible!","good day, this place is amazing it has its own charm. It's quiet and clean here. The pool is beautiful too. The most I would like to praise is the staff. We have an unforgettable experience here.

If u like quiet, calm and chill, this place is d best option..
Clean, friendly, helpful staff..
Have an awesome room, u can me time in bathup or just showering outside..
I completely love this place","Staff were very welcoming and allowed us to check in early as/when our rooms became available. There is also a luggage storage room if required.

Rooms were clean and spacious. We were in one of the four non-swimming pool facing rooms and had two double beds so plenty of space for 2 people! Bathroom did not have any natural air or windows to them but were clean and equipped with hot water.

Very relaxed vibe and nice and quiet.

No food or drinks service here, but there is a fully functioning kitchen you can use and also two restaurants that are within walking distance from the hotel. Easy to order food in via Grab too.

Otherwise location wise you'll need to hire a moped (which you can from the hotel) or get a taxi from Grab/ Gojek for anywhere else on your itinerary which was super easy with loads of drivers available.

Would return again. Thank you!","The room was perfect.
Breakfast was good.
It was a peaceful place but  somehow far from restaurants and cafes."

Everyone working there was incredibly friendly and helpful.
The Villa‚Äôs themselves were surprisingly really nice and bright and airy, and the outdoors bathroom was a real highlight. However, it was the gardens around this villas which made them really special, with lovey flowers and plants, little birds, and a stunning view over the pool (we only wish there was maybe a few more pool loungers).
The included breakfast was very tasty and freshly prepared.
The location is a little away from all the action, but is within walking distance of the stunning Tanah Barak Cliff and a super quiet and stunning beach - clearest water we experienced in Bali. Grabs were also quick to arrive and cheap to book to anywhere we wanted to go.","We really enjoyed our overnight stay here. The room was comfortable, we appreciated the refreshing pool and the ocean outlook. The location is handy to Pantai Pandawa and Melasti beaches and paragliding activities.

The staff were very accommodating with an early arrival & late check-out on our part and arranged a scooter for us very promptly at little notice. My only suggestion would be to have a couple more pool loungers. üòÑ Thank you for a lovely stay!","What a perfect place to start our trip to Bali, hidden in the hills the views are spectacular and it is so peaceful you wouldn't know it's there. The staff are really friendly and the rooms are a good size, clean and tidy. Bathroom is a gorgeous design with a nice power shower! WiFi works well too which is always a plus! Free breakfast with our stay every morning and staff on hand till late in the evening should we need anything, thank you!",The only thing nice about this place is the view. Cleanness is not in their vocabulary and the service was terrible. There were mouse feces in our bathroom and they didn‚Äôt clean them for the duration of our stay. And on top of that the mice themselves. They were roaming around the room like nothing happens. The bathroom was not clean. The furniture and facilities were run down. The pool had worms inside. Also our sub hurt his foot as there is no sufficient lighting at night. when we asked them for medkit they said they don‚Äôt have even a plaster. Definitely not value for money and we will never go there again. Last but not least the breakfast was exactly the same every day no variety whatsoever.,"The location is splendid, you can see from the restaurant Pantai Pandawa and people with their cows each morning.
Our host, Komang was great, helped us to get a really great scooter.
The place is magic, the bungalows are cozy, the bed was one of the best ones I slept in. The smell of wood and bamboo is wonderful, it destressing and energizing.
Really wonderful thing to have open bathroom, and how each plant and stone was placed. It was not so great depending from who is reading, we were in rainy season and at 2-3 in the morning it would really pour, and if you need to go to toilet you would be making a shower also üòÑ. Also during the night there were a couple of frogs that hanged out in the bathtub.
Each day they would give us 2 small bottles of water mostly to wash our teeth.
It's a place were definitely going to revisit."

I recommend this Homestay if you want good place to stay in South of Bali.","Very quiet and noiseless. Even the other guests rooms are well isolated which is pretty rare in Bali. It's basic but you get aircon, kettle and reading light.TV but local channels only.
Recommended BUT you need a scooter. The amazing hosts can help you for the matter.","Homestay for a very good price. it has a nice bed, TV, Bathroom with working toilet and shower, small ""kitchen"". Staff is really really nice and helpful. Got here too early, but they were happy to see me. The location is a bit off the road but perfect for visiting pandawa beach, which I highly recommend to visit. it also is a quiet place here which I really admire. Absolutely recommendable. Stayed here for one night. But mind that this is a homestay ;)

P.S. the pictures here are well representable","Agree with Jakob.  Great spot to relax, listen to the waves crashing on the beach while you watch the stars.  Cows, chickens, macaques, etc. nearby if you like nature.  It is NOT a party area, but perfect for couples and people who want to get away from tourists and CHILL.","Nice stuff, good room, fast wifi.

We booked for 1 week as a trial to maybe stay for a few months, but we left after 3 hours. This place is completely run down, which is fine, we are not that picky. But the more we looked at things, the more horrified we got. The pillows were completely stained with black mold (you could see it through the pillowcase - I'm not a Karen checking pillows everywhere I go), the mattresses are awful. The oven and microwave were completely molded too. Everything else is just broken, stained or rusted. Dirty glasses, fridge, pots. Holes in the walls, broken surfaces, light bulbs hanging. Mind you this booking was not done last minute, so they had time to prepare for our arrival.
A true shame since the building is beautiful and the lawn part itself is nice. I'm sure it was gorgeous back in the day, but it was very poorly maintained. Thankfully AirBnb assisted us to get our refund. But ofc it completely disrupted our trip, since we had to book something else last minute.
The on-site Co-host completely ghosted us when we sent her pictures of the many awful things we found. And the main host completely lied to us telling that she had taken the beautiful pictures only 3 months ago, when it was clear that most damages didn't happen in the past 3 months.
This house needs a full renovation, so don't trust the current pictures you see. The place is still online on Airbnb, so it doesn't look like the Host is gonna fix anything. If you are already in Bali, I would suggest going for a visit before booking to make sure they have renovated/upgraded things.","Margaret's series of villas are truly remarkable. Surrounded by lush, beautiful plants and slightly removed from the chaos and horns of Bali traffic our stay allowed us to both access the excitement of life in Bali and a quiet place to relax and listen to the ocean. My friends and family joined me and my husband, staying at the villas for a week.

The open air villas were gorgeous and allowed us privacy when we wanted it while also possessing a multitude of areas to gather and meet. AC was available but largely unnecessary because of the design of the villas which maximized the abundant ocean breezes.

Photos tend not to do this place justice. Some favourite spaces include: the upstairs bathrooms equipped with baths capable of holding two or three people comfortably. The plunge pools overlooking the gardens at the top level of each villa, the main pool (a natural place for basking and morning planning sessions), the ocean views and sprawling, luscious grounds and the lily pad path with stepping stones and swimming fish.

The area is relatively quiet and we enjoyed walking to the cliff face to view Pandawa beach and taking a small path down to a secluded beach just off Pandawa. While the walk down was a hike not a stroll it was well worth the effort.

The staff were the highlight of our stay in the villa, they were both unobtrusive and attentive. Yuni, the villa manager, was both an amazing organizer and excellent chef and baker. If a plan is possible, Yuni will be able to execute it with a plum. We had many food restrictions and Yuni was able to make healthy, tasty meals that met all of our varied needs. This was much more impressive than it sounds! Even when we were a smaller group eating in was more cost effective than eating out at even the cheapest restaurants. (Warung food is still sometimes cheaper but rarely suitable for all in a diverse group). The included breakfasts were hearty and healthy and the cooking staff were more than willing to share recipes. They even sent one of our friends home with spice mixes! The driver, Edy, was friendly, prompt and more than willing to work outside his scheduled hours. The grounds were always thoroughly maintained and the rooms regularly tidied with laundry done at a very reasonable price.

Our wedding was wonderfully attended to at a level we could not have imagined. It was done under budget, with impressive detail and little work on our part. We told Margaret what we envisioned and she made it happen below our price point. We did not expect a wedding planner (which would have been a major cost anywhere else) but it was an included service. Our wedding plan was gone through with a fine tooth comb to ensure it went smoothly and as intended.

Multiple locations for prewedding photos were arranged on our behalf and while we didn't ask for an elaborate wedding, there was an incredible level of decoration and overall consideration which would have suggested weeks of in-depth planning.

The food was excellent, especially the ribs which were the best ribs we have ever had! The amount of food available for our budget was astonishing. Yuni even mastered creating a complicated cheesecake for us. If you are planning a wedding in Bali you may know that some level of bureaucratic hassle is usually unavoidable. The villa negotiated with the banjar on our behalf to reduce fees and make arrangements so that this was a non-issue for us.

The wedding surpassed our expectations in every way. A huge thank you to all the staff at the Villa Bidadari!","Just stay here for a wesk and loved it, cooked myself, staff were friendly and villa is freshly renovated and comfortable No problems at all!",Very friendly staff. The garmin pin drop in kabuputten is wrong. We went to the Nusa Dua one. Just a bit far from shops and tourist areas but a great getaway and holiday.

The place gives you a feeling of privacy and peace that is hard to find in such a touristy area. The only problems we had was that the people staying in the room next to us played loud music and partied until past midnight, and when I asked the staff about it they claimed all the sound was from the beach, even though it was obviously the neighbors. I guess they just don‚Äôt want to deal with trying to enforce any kind of quiet rule. Also, while the room was beautiful, it wasn‚Äôt very clean.
