It was my dream to stay in bamboo hotel into the Balinese jungle and my dream came true. Suenyo is the place with wonderful and so comfortable bungalows with incredible views of the jungle, especially in the early morning, don't miss this time! But I always thought that bamboo hotels are very hot and stuffy, but the air conditioning works great. A Balinese ceremony awaits you during check-in, which immediately immerses you in the traditions of the island. The breakfast was amazing, all services are really good. I also notice the care in the details when they also bring you an immune shot for breakfast. I had experience of massage treatment in the shala near the river in the rainy weather, it was so atmospheric, calm and really relaxed. You can order floating breakfast and flower bath. Really recommend to enjoy it in the comfort of the jungle. The staff is so hospitality and always help you.",Another beautiful stay at Suenyo. It‚Äôs the perfect romantic getaway spot. The massage experience was probably the best I‚Äôve ever had anywhere in the world. The food was also fantastic and the rooms are stunning! The staff were wonderful and so sweet. We love Suenyo and can‚Äôt wait to come back.,"Wow! What an experience!
Best retreat I had in my life. Never felt so relaxed and hugged by nature before.
This is definitely the most unique place we have ever stayed at.
Every little detail is just perfect.
The room is incredibly beautiful in every corner of it, the service is above and beyond what you normally expect and the breakfast was lovely too!

Can't wait to come back, thank you so much for the amazing team of Suenyo and especially for Mila for being extremely kind and helpful. ‚ù§Ô∏è","We had an exceptional babymoon at Eco Suenyo retreat in Bali. The serene and eco-friendly environment was perfect for relaxing and reconnecting before our baby‚Äôs arrival. Our room was luxurious with a magnificent view, and the private pool and flower bath were incredible.

The staff was incredibly attentive and welcoming, ensuring our stay was memorable. We enjoyed the daily treats and delicious meals at the on-site restaurant.

Eco Suenyo exceeded our expectations and offered us the perfect blend of luxury and nature. Highly recommended for an unforgettable stay in Bali.","What a dreamy place to stay! From the very beginning we have felt so welcome and have been treated to world class hospitality! The food and the service were outstanding and the pavilions were amazing! We will never forget our experience here. Thank you to the entire team, you have created something very special."
