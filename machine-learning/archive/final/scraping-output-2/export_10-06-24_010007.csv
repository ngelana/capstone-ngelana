We‚Äôre happy to have met him and he became a great friend.This little oasis is a gem you shouldn‚Äôt miss in Bali. Wish we could have stayed more.
It‚Äôs impeccable, clean and beautiful!","Everything was just PERFECT here!
The staff is amazing!
Gede was very helpful and he‚Äôs a great friend!
The rooms are so clean and nice, with quality linen and towels.
Breakfast looks great!","This is not a villa. Its a collection of cabins. They are the cheap option for providing accommodation. Partly prefabricated, thwy vary in size and quality. Still a bit much to call it a villa.","We started our Bali trip here, wonderful place to stay.
We felt very welcomed, staff was incredibly friendly and helpfull. Took care of us anytime they could.
We can just recommend this place.
30-45minutes Ubud and close to other spots.
Terima kasih ! :)","This is one of the best, and most beautiful places I have ever been!
It's an oasis of calm and truly is the best place to come ""home"" to after a busy Bali day!
The staff is super helpful and wil do everything to help you!
The bungalow's are big, spacious and super clean!
Can recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a place to stay!
Truly 10/10"

The store closed at 9 but they let us dine after 9 since there are no other restaurants around.  Totally recommend it for local food,"So tasty, love it. And the best part was it's cozy place where I can stretch my legs and chill from the heat of the sun. Great place for travellers near celuk area",Delicious food but expensive and way of the standard price for the same type of food and the same set restaurants I ever visited. You can pay less and get more at another place.,Excellent food and restaurant for a very good price. Highly recommended for people interested in local hangouts,Best local pork rice dish ever.
