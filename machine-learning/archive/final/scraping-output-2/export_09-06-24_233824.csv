ChIJXfZP2tYg0i0RUaM-yoiFiXs,Leke Leke Waterfall,-8.3666011,115.19782149999999,"Kerobokan, Jl. Swadaya, Mekarsari, Kec. Baturiti, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82191, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=8901792961029645137,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.4,2070,,"Visited this place over the weekend and we got there at 1 pm. It wasn't very crowded at that time. The entrance fee was 50,000 rupiah and they offered us a welcome drink upon arrival. The waterfall was stunning and the trek to get there wasn't too difficult. Additionally, there was a 10% discount at their restaurant if you spent a minimum of 100,000 rupiah. The food was delicious and the view was breathtaking. Definitely worth a visit.The waterfall is just like any other waterfall in Bali, but the walk down to it is incredibly scenic. However, in my opinion, it's just a typical tourist trap. The entrance fee of 50,000 rupiah seems a bit steep, and the real tourist trap is encountered on the way down to the waterfall. There, you'll find Bali swings that charge a whopping 200,000 rupiah. That price is outrageous, especially considering it's not included in the entrance ticket. The restaurant at the top of the waterfall actually had reasonable prices. The food ranged from 30,000 to 50,000 rupiah, which is quite affordable for a tourist spot in Bali.","Imagine a picturesque waterfall nestled in nature's embrace, accessible via a leisurely 30-minutes hike along a well-maintained pathway. Along the way, you'll be surrounded by lush greenery, vibrant flora, and the soothing sounds of chirping birds. As you approach the waterfall, the air becomes crisper, and the scenery more enchanting, culminating in a breathtaking view of cascading water against a backdrop of majestic cliffs and serene wilderness. It's a tranquil escape that rewards both the senses and the soul, offering a perfect blend of adventure and serenity for nature lovers of all kinds.","Amazingly helpful staff, from the person indicating where to park the motorbike to the staff at the restaurant and everybody in between. Incredibly helpful and polite whether you were arriving or leaving. One of the most friendliest and helpful guest service interactions with ever had in Bali.the daughter for itself is beautiful and well worth spending time enjoying the cool air below ready for the hot walk back up. Amazing tropical forest views and very reasonably well priced restaurant. 10 out of 10.","The waterfall is beautiful and worth the downhill/uphill trek. The path is mostly steps.
Recommend taking a dip in the cool water to cool down. Wear loose, breathable clothing, helps with the humidity.
Drinks and ice cream available for purchase. Lots of nature to observe on the trek and photo ops.","The waterfall is just another waterfall in Bali, but the long walk down to the waterfall is beautiful.
If you ask me, it's just another turist trap.
The entry price of 50.000 idr is a bit to much and the big turist trap is on the way down to the waterfall.
Here you meet Bali swings to the price of 200.000 idr. That totally crazy. I could understand if the entry tricket was including the swing.
But No !!
The restaurant on the top did actually charge some fair prices.
Food cost between 30-50.000 idr.
That cheap on a turist teap in Bali"
