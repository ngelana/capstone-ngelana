The gentleman who takes care of things overnight is extremely nice and welcoming. However I can't say that about the rest of the staff. I found them to be either racist or they are just unwelcoming. I found myself being followed around , I have never experienced this in my life before. I walked into the ""shop"" and this guy followed us like we were going to take something and then we headed to another room that we thought might be the air conditioned lobby and a worker interrupted my brother as he opened the door yelling ""where do you think you are going"" . They have no real lobby.The resort itself has a nice viewing area overlooking the jungle but the rooms feel rather haunted and have a negative energy that I myself and my accompanying guests felt.

I am an abstract painter myself and had inquired several times to set up a time to see the gallery, the request was met with extremely inappropriate and rude responses with obvious displeasure on the faces including "" we are too busy to show it to you today or tomorrow"" or ""It's for special people"" . I had booked this resort specifically due to my interest in art. Even if the owner of the gallery does not wish to show the gallery I think it should be clearly stated in their hotel description that they will refuse to show the art of an ""art resort"". I stayed somewhere else in ubud the other nights and it was an amazing experience , this is also in an inconvenient location from the city center. I would never book again.",Secluded location in the hills of ubud. Very tranquil.  2 pools and many spots to sit and relax in nature.  Waterfall is right beside resort and a small trek down.  Lots of funky art and they even have 3 restaurants which aren't bad.  Service is polite and friendly. Some guests have bfast included.,"If you want to have quiet nights, a big hotel area to explore in the jungle, 2 pools and you want to visit a nearby waterfall, then you will be at the right place!
From my POV it may have been a 5 star resort once, however today, it feels a bit outdated here and there. However it‚Äôs now well integrated into the jungle with a lot of green: Plants, flowers, trees etc.
The staff is nice and very helpful and also the scooter rental options are great.
The only real bummer we found were the prices in the restaurant, which was overpriced compared to quality and the options you have in Ubud (especially with good restaurants).","spacious bedroom and bathroom.  The room has air conditioning and a fan.  Large comfortable bed, plus a table and two chairs to relax looking out the window.  When we arrived, the air conditioning was already on and we didn't notice the smell of humidity, but in the room next to ours, where our friends stayed, the smell of humidity could be clearly noticed, which soon disappears when you turn on the air conditioning or open the windows.  The reception was super kind in showing us everything and indicating things to do in the hotel itself and in the region.  in the morning a part of our group walked around the hotel and said that they have a very nice little waterfall.  At breakfast the attendants answered all our questions and requests for menu adjustments, as one person in our group has severe food allergies.  we were only there for one night but it was possible to see how pleasant it would be to stay longer.  special attention to the receptionists who, whenever they saw us, asked if everything was ok.","All the staff were so friendly and accomodating, and helped us organise tours around the local area. It's a lovely location that has walking access to a waterfall as well. The room was clean and spacious, the pool areas were beautiful too. We'll definitely be back üòä thank you to everyone there for making the stay so memorable!"

The villa itself was in a great location - not as many bugs and creep crawlies as we expected! The pool was devine and the water was fresh and very enjoyable.

There is one kitchen which serves great meals.

Situated just outside of central ubud (with a free shuttle into town) between rice fields, forests and the river. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.

The view is amazing, and getting up early in the morning and listening to the nature waking up is priceless. Everything is beautifully decorated with carefully selected details, both inside the rooms and in the courtyard and restaurant. The path to the waterfall starts right next to the pool, and takes you through the jungle all the way to the river below.","Villa Kalisat offers a truly unique experience with incredibly friendly and accommodating staff who go above and beyond to ensure a memorable stay. They effortlessly assisted us in organizing transportation and various activities, seamlessly enhancing our trip. Nestled amidst a charming family village, the location provides a beautiful view of the jungle river bed, creating a wonderful ambiance. Despite some steep stairs, the staff readily attends to any needs, even bringing items directly to your room and assisting with luggage. Comprising primarily of locals and close relatives of the family village at the front, everyone warmly welcomes guests to explore and ask about balinese culture, rituals, and even visit their own family temple, adding a deeper cultural immersion to the stay.

Moreover, Villa Kalisat boasts a convenient location approximately 20 minutes from Ubud, with complimentary shuttle service to the city every morning at 10 AM. Additionally, the villa offers a delightful breakfast experience featuring fresh tropical fruits, a fresh fruit juices everyday, coffee/tea, and homemade bread and jelly plus a dish from their menu. It's the perfect way to start your day immersed in Bali's flavors and hospitality. Overall, our stay was nothing short of wonderful, and I wholeheartedly recommend Villa Kalisat for a truly memorable Bali experience.","This is a must to visit! (If you do not have small children). Villa Kallisat is situated in the middle of the jungle as well as rice fields, a combination I would not have thought possible, just outside of Ubud. The service is excellent, the food marvelous and the rooms are filled with wonderful details and warmth. I can only gibe them my best recommendation. We had planned to stay there for 4 nights, but ended up shortening down to 2 nights as it was too stressful with our two year old son. We do however need to come back in a few years as this was soooooo worth visiting. Just to add, the views from the dining or pool area are breathtaking. We absolutely loved it.

The villa is situated at the end of the family house which means you get to experience and see a local balinese family whenever you go to and from the villa. The family members welcomed our children in a... family way. We really hope to come back.","This is an amazing property.
Room interiors are amazing. Pool is well maintained. And breakfast is too good.
Staffs are friendly and warm.
There are a lot of steps on the property so be wary of that.","My partner and I recently stayed at Villa Kalisat for three nights in the Waterfall Room. I cannot recommend this place highly enough!! The staff are all incredibly welcoming and lovely, and were so helpful when I needed to see a doctor during my stay. The view is truly amazing (and is particularly spectacular from the daybed in the Waterfall Room). We enjoyed it here so much that we are already planning a return trip!"

Superb view over the rice fields and part of the jungle. Personnel very nice and friendly.
Food was good overall and prices are decent-ish but most of the portions are quite small. Nasi Goreng with chicken was very yummy and surprisingly large portion but Balinese Sate Lilit had very small amount of meat + 2 bites of a salad and plain rice...at the same 65K IDR.
Young coconut - tried twice here and the later one was mayne..not that young :) First one tasted a lot better.
Avocado fresh juice you can skip...it's expected to not have any solid flavor as avocado it's relatively blend but due to chocolate syrup poured on the interior of the glass you will only taste..some chocolate without knowing or tasting anymore if there is some avocado there or not  :)
Overall for today's dinner payed 343K IDR(approx. 20 Eur).
Ps: young papaya salad(good, sweet and spicy) very small portion
Sweet corn soup is as well a very small portion
Pancakes(the green ones :) ) filled with shredded coconut. Good but nothing to amaze
Will visit again for sure :)","extremely yummy food,  and very correct service all at reasonable prices and in a gorgeous environment,  next to the rice paddies, but easy parking and clean. They also provide mosquito coils in the evening and payment by card is no problem.  our new regular place for dinner! lovely.  terimakasih","Came without a booking at a crowded lunchtime, but they still managed to find a table for 10.

The entire experience, priceless.","Very local place, good food at cheap prices and you get a great view of rice field.

Not for those with walking difficulties or heart problems as the steps back up are a definite killer. But if you're younger and love a bit of adventure without necessarily reaching the falls then it is for you. I did it at 66 but I'm reasonably fit, hubby couldn't have made it.",You need to climb down some stairs to reach the Holy Water Temple and Petanu River. The stairs are quite steep. The access to the waterfall is unclear and slippery. You need to be very careful or go with locals if possible.,"BE CAREFUL ON THE STAIRS!

If the stairs are wet, it is very slippery - especially near the river, next to the small temple.

Honey Villa Ubud was the highlight of my Bali trip with my wife! So spacious, clean, everything felt brand new, but yet so cosy. This was the first place during the trip we both could get a good night sleep, not being woken up by the sounds of the city. Every night we went to sleep with the ""sounds of nature"" and were greeted by bird songs in the morning. A quick dip in the most amazing pool before morning coffee, why not? Next - to the villa's own gym and ice bath, why not? Every morning ritual that made me feel fresh the whole day in Bali's heat. If you want your own place you can call home while in Bali, look no further! Honey Villa is a place where we will be coming back for sure, and location is amazing as well. Most food deliveries took no more than half an hour! And you have your own BBQ! I highly recommend this property!",Loving the serenity of the villa and the views of the green valley Ubud.  Its very close location to centre of Ubud around 10 minutes motor bike rides but its hard to leave such a relaxing villa.,"Stepping into Honey Villa Ubud felt like being whisked away into an enchanting world where luxury meets soulful tranquility. From the moment I crossed the threshold, I was greeted by the unmistakable charm of a brand-new villa that somehow felt as familiar and comforting as an old friend. The villa's wooden floors, which gleam with the warmth of a thousand suns, immediately caught my attention, offering a promise of the luxury that lay in wait.

But what truly sets Honey Villa apart is its heart ‚Äì a real Idrasyl tree stands proudly at its core, its branches stretching upwards as if to capture the essence of the sky itself. Around every corner, the villa unveils breathtaking views that seem to blend seamlessly into the horizon, with lush jungles that whisper tales of ancient spirits and untold mysteries.

The villa's amenities are nothing short of spectacular, boasting a pool so deep and inviting that it feels like diving into the very soul of Bali itself. For those who, like me, appreciate the blend of relaxation and activity, the gym offers state-of-the-art equipment, all the while promising awe-inspiring jungle views that make every workout session an adventure. And let‚Äôs not forget the cold bath - an experience that rejuvenates the spirit and awakens the senses, all while being cradled by the jungle's embrace.

But what truly captivated me was the villa's undeniable romantic spirit, a beacon for anyone with a penchant for spiritual experiences. Every nook and cranny of Honey Villa whispers tales of love and enchantment, making it a sanctuary for those seeking a deeper connection with themselves and the world around them. It's a place where the veil between our world and the mystical seems to thin, offering glimpses into realms untold.

Despite its otherworldly ambiance, the villa is but a mere 10 minutes from the vibrant heart of Ubud, offering the best of both worlds - the serenity of a secluded paradise and the convenience of proximity to the town's rich cultural tapestry.

Pluses:

Brand New & Luxurious: Every inch of the villa screams luxury, yet it feels as cozy as home.
Wooden Floors & Idrasyl Tree: These features add a unique charm and warmth to the villa.
Stunning Views & Deep Pool: The views are unparalleled, and the pool is just perfect.
Gym & Cold Bath: For those who love staying active, these amenities are top-notch, with the bonus of breathtaking views.
Romantic & Spiritual: A haven for those seeking a deeper connection and romantic experience.
Location: Perfectly situated, offering tranquility and convenience.
The only downside? The heartbreaking realization that I cannot stay here forever. Honey Villa Ubud isn't just a place to stay; it's a vibrant, soulful experience that leaves a lasting imprint on your heart. If you're seeking a slice of paradise that offers both luxury and a warm soul, look no further. Honey Villa Ubud is a dream woven into reality, a place where every moment is a treasure waiting to be discovered.",Very beautiful villa in Ubud. Perfect for both large company and privacy.

Lovely spot, excellent service. A little bit fancy and a little more expensive ($$) to go with. We comfortably ate 1 main each and shared a dessert with a couple of drinks which worked out to about $50 Australian. Really nice for something a bit different, would recommend and we will happily go back! :)

The carbonara is also decent. However, the truffle fries could use more truffle. You can barely taste it. Overall, it‚Äôs a good meal.",
