â€”

Ok overall, if you looking for place to rest from long distance driving! This one good option!","if go to Singaraja via Gilimanuk this place maybe an option to take a break and eat

the price is fair the taste is good but the soup a little bit salty

the view of rice fields make this place so good",This warung sells food made of pork. The taste is good and it's worth the money. The price is only IDR 15K for 1 portion of babi guling. The beverage starts from IDR 5K. There's a rice field view that you can enjoy during eating. The location is on the side of the road so you can easily notice it.,"A decent taste of Balinese foods served here; Lawar, Jukut Ares, Sudang Lepet Jukut Undis, Babi Guling. The taste isn't special yet it isn't bad either, and you can have it in a cheap price. The restaurant is spacious; many seats available, but without big table for group. And the parking is large too.","Kinda clean and good view restaurant.
Food is rice with roasted pork. So spicy with me."
