Solana is perched atop a beautiful mountain top overlooking the valley below. The design of the property is masterful, allowing for peace and tranquility. The staff are attentive, smiling and eager to help. This is a perfect setting for a retreat from the hustle of the city, and Ubud, Yet it is not too far if one wishes to venture into town. 5-stars.","I honestly cannot say enough good things about this retreat centre. Walking into Solana quite literally took my breath away. This place is really something special.
The pools and outdoor living areas are absolutely breathtaking. Every detail of the space has been thoughtfully designed. The rooms are stunning: high ceilings, comfortable beds, grand views to the lush grounds and an outdoor shower all built in an ecologically responsible way.

But, what really makes Solana an oasis away from home, is the staff - Kind, caring, attentive, these folks go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and cared for. And Chef Leo, a true culinary artist, curating a daily menu of local ingredients, each item prepared with utmost intent. Every meal a sensory experience.
ü©∑üíõüíö

Thank you Solana for providing such a healing space; the last 10 days have truly helped to nourish my mind, body and soul.

-Miss Anna üòá","This is by far one of the best places I've been to in Bali. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The food is amazing! And I love the eco friendly approach, especially that they use no chemicals whatsoever, which will result in animals being your direct neighbors or even roommates sometimes, which is just part of being in Bali though. And I love it!
I am also super excited to host my retreat at Solana in July, because of all the mentioned reasons. Thank you Anshu, for your beautiful spirit and welcoming energy ü§ó","We are so glad that we chose this hotel amongst the huge choice available in Ubud. It feels like a true retreat from the busy hectic streets of Ubud. When you return to the resort you feel a sense of peace and Tranquility from the rooms, the main area and the beautiful water gardens.
Although the breakfasts are vegan and vegetarian, they include eggs and are quite delicious. The view is wonderful. The yoga in the morning is a great way to start the day. The rooms themselves are fantastically designed and we never wanted to leave. They really made us feel very calm and create a sense of happy energy.

One thing to note, some previous bad reviews have talked about the bugs and wildlife. It‚Äôs a retreat in a beautiful jungle River Valley. If you don‚Äôt like bugs and lizards and frogs then don‚Äôt come here, we found it to be beautiful to be a little bit in touch with nature when in the bathroom and on the terrace. But very sensitive city folk might prefer a concrete hotel in the centre of the city! The rooms have huge mosquito nets so you can sleep in peace and rare any bugs made it to the cool air conditioned room.","I would highly recommend Solana for an organic, spiritual and luxurious time in the jungle. The food is incredibly tasty and you can tell it‚Äôs tailored to be incredibly healthy also. The landscaping is a dream, so many fruit trees and beautiful flowers and plants. The setting is out of this world and the staff are incredibly helpful, they go above and beyond to make sure you have the best time, including bringing you to water temples and organising anything your heart desires. The rooms are so unique, incredible natural buildings made of poured earth and bamboo, super luxurious and with outdoor bathrooms overlooking the jungle!"

Building noise from early morning. No cocktails or bar. No staff on site at night if there‚Äôs an issue, and there‚Äôs many. A good place to ruin a nice holiday. Furthermore, the photos and description make this place look huge, it‚Äôs tiny, and has all of 4x chaises by the pool. Also it‚Äôs super far from Ubud centre. Barely any - a good way to ruin a nice peaceful holiday. The design of the place and the staff however are lovely but - it doesn‚Äôt make up for it.","A wonderful, peaceful retreat with well equipped, clean and modern rooms and kind, helpful local staff.

The location is a bit rural and the access road is in poor condition, but the area is beautiful and tranquil. We rented a scooter through the hotel for 100k a day which was helpful as the area (as with a lot of Ubud) does not allow Grab/ Gojek to operate pick up.

The room had good, strong Aircon. I would recommend keeping doors shut though as there are a lot of bugs (with it being pretty much in the jungle).

The hotel does a good job of spraying to deter the worst of the bugs around the pool but there were a lot of ants on the seating bar facing out of the restaurant to the jungle.

The main issue we had was with breakfast - the choice felt quite limited after a few days (we stayed a week) and you have to order the day before. We also received a phone call to our room at 9am if we hadn't yet showed up to breakfast (which ran until 10.30). On our first day we had been travelling and slept poorly, so a 9am wake up from a loud phone ringing was not ideal when we had set our alarms for 9.30am anyway.

Advice to the hotel would be that you should set your breakfast times and if guests miss those times, they can pay for food from the all day menu!","Beautiful set-up of 8 individual villas downhill towards a stunning infinity pool overlooking a jungle of bamboo, palm trees etc. The villa has a great design, a very comfortable and large bed, spacious bathroom area, outdoor bathtub and a sitting area overlooking the pool, excellent! The staff was awesome, friendly and attentive, a real pleasure to deal with. TV was great with tons of paid channels and live TV. A bit far from everything but there's a great (and super cheap) local restaurant 200m away that is worth visiting. This is the best place to relax and do NOTHING!",Lovely rooms with good air conditioning and his and hers sinks. Nice bed and linen. Mini fridge. View from the pool and restaurant is amazing. Staff are usually in a back area so you will have to call or find them if you need something. Very nice stay.,"This place is honestly a little magically. We stayed in a gorgeous, modern villa..theres only I think 6 in total? And we hardly even saw other people.
We watched sunsets in the pool overlooking the jungle..it was very romantic.
The staff were helpful, friendly, and the breakie was great.
The only downside is that it's far away from the husle and bustle of the city, so make sure you remember to buy whatever you need when leaving town for the day/night.
We got to know the locals as they drove us into the city each day via the taxi stand.
I will never forget our stay here!!"

Location is 25mins drive from ubud town centre, not many restaurants around. Very peaceful though.

The pool is nice but not very clean.

We booked in advance but checked out 2 days later having lost our payment for the other nights. The owner is RUSSIAN and it spoils everything. There is no Balinese atmosphere with its Asian sweet hospitality. The owner only showed where the room and kitchen were, but didn't even explain how to use it. Russian songs were played in the evening, Russian friends gathered and spoiled the whole atmosphere. Although the hostess was almost always at the hotel, she never said hello and was not interested at all. Thanks only to the cleaning guy, advised interesting places.
Although the room has a bathroom, the boiler is so small that you only need to take a shower.","Stayed here for 4 nights and I think it's worth the money. The place is comfortable, we have our own pool and kitchen, shared between 2 rooms. Every room has private bathroom.
It's not crystal clear and mold free villa, but we are satisfied with this place. Would be better if they maintain and took better care of this place.
The location itself for me was quite far from center of Ubud, more like Gianyar rather than Ubud but it's ok.
Just info, if you ride a car here, you must extra carefully because the road is very narrow, exactly fit for 2 cars and sometimes I think it's just for 1.5 cars LOL
Wouldn't mind to stay here again.","This villa is a perfect getaway for couple and family. The staff was very humble. The check-in service was quick. In general the bedroom and bathroom are nice, but need some improvement on facilities and cleanliness. They should provide a dust bin at the terrace area in each villa. Glasses in bathroom were dirty, looks like they never been used for months. I will suggest the management providing in-room electric kettle to make hot water for standard coffee/tea. We stayed at villa in front nearby the parking area. Very noisy at night, we can hear people/staff talk. We enjoy our stay in this villa, except some of notes for improvements.","Had a great 4 days is this villa. Staffs were very helpful. The pool the room and the toilet was very spacious. Clean comfortable and well maintained. And all the places were very beautiful and luxurious.
And to mention, there is a kitchen and a dining area too. Would recommend this beautiful villa to anyone who is staying in Ubud.","It‚Äôs a quiet cozy villa which is what we wanted, especially the nice bathroom with big bathtub. Everything is well thought and clean, we both enjoy the villa a lot. The only thing is that the villa is not close to Ubud downtown area, we would have stayed for a few more days if it‚Äôs close enough"

I absolutely fell in love with the dog Lucy, who frequents the restaurant every day and whom I fed sausages to.
The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating and is clean and well air conditioned, making it a comfortable experience.
The service is fast and friendly, and I was very pleased with everything that I ate and drank.
I highly recommend the coconut and cinnamon shake, and nasi goreng.

Lastly the waiters are all friendly and helpful to provide me with anything I need, including they notified me of the discount availability before checking out.

One of the worst experience in Bali and I have been travelling for the past 3 weeks. While the villa is ok, The host Adi does not know how to treat his guests.

The villa is not private at all, one morning I woke up and I realised someone came inside the villa early in the morning without my permission.
I called the host to complain as I got robbed in a similar manner a few days back so I did not want to have the same experience ( i have phones and laptops).

Instead of apologising he started being rude telling me I was lying. Then he said his father came to clean (at 8am??).¬† He then told me i was inventing this so that I don't pay the nights lol. Basically i was a thief.

When I sent him pictures proving someone did indeed come and that no cleaning was done he became even more aggressive and asked me to leave the villa right away. While my check out was only due to the next day, I happily left that place.

He later admitted his wife did came inside (what for?) but still instead of apologising he kept being arrogant.

Hope this helps others.","Villa nya bagus bgt , nice view pokoknyaa really really recomend this for the peope that want to have a nice holiday",Wonderful host and beautiful facilities.

It's actually very noisy during the day because they have jewelry classes. Continual banging on metal by a dozen people sounds like your living next to a construction site.

There is no safe in the room.

transport - 80-100,000 IDR to get to Ubud one way. Scooters are much more cost effective.  Also, it's a newish location so make sure you have a map to help any drivers find their way here - we used google a few times to help drivers find the place.

The croissants are the best in Ubud! The cappuccino and latte was sometimes too hot, but you can get used to it. The espresso is tart, resulting in a very invigorating cup of coffee. This is the perfect combination with all the baked goods :) Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è

p.s. Croissants have risen in price to 12,000 IDR.","Really good pastries and fairly priced, good coffee. Strong WiFi too, and most of the time it‚Äôs empty so you can have the place for yourself. Peaceful environment, they don‚Äôt blast annoying music. Great place to work.","Simple, fresh croissants and more. Good coffee.  It's a bit too hot inside.","Great coffee and good place for working. The pastry was too hard, it seemed too long or not so perfect. The pudding was too sweet, I couldn‚Äôt have it at all. Good price and not so crowded.","Small and basic caf√©, with relatively modern decor. Fairly quiet, I rarely see others there. Since March, they seem to have slightly limited selection, but the still allow take out... some cakes, tarts, loaf slices, and even the whole pandan chiffon cake for 20k!!

It's definitely not the same as Bengawan Solo, but it'll do!"

It is only 10min south of central Ubud in a very nice area. The house itself is unique in its design, with so many special features, with stylish and comfortable interior design. It has many living areas, open spaces, large fully equipped kitchen, helpful friendly staff, willing to accommodate when ever needed. All the bedrooms with their own ensuites and views from every room are very comfortable. There is so much more, which any guest would fully appreciate when staying here. We have really enjoyed staying in this wonderful property, very memorable.","We had the pleasure of staying at Villa Santai for a few nights and we had the most unforgettable experience. The villa is gorgeous, the staff incredibly friendly and the view is breathtaking!  We were able to practise yoga on the pool deck each morning overlooking the luscious jungle which was a truly special experience...the infinite pool itself was divine and allowed us to cool down on the warmer tropical days. We ended each day with a glorious sunset view over the jungle from the comfort of our sweeping balcony. If you desire a luxurious, secluded and memorable experience in a pristine villa only 15 minutes from Ubud centre, then I would highly recommend a stay at Villa Santai...I promise you won't regret it!","Our stay at Villa Santai was just perfect!
We loved the design of the villa especially the main area.
The staff were really nice with us.
We reccomend this villa to a family gourp or just a group of friends.","Beautiful place, with a stunning view. Recommended place to stay as group/family.",The villa is nice but The road the this villa istana very tiny and trouble.
