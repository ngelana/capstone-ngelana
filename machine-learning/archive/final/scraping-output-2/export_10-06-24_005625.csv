The ayam Bakar is not bad. I like the bumbu which they use and how they baste it. The vegetable portion is a little small and they didn't have basil leaves to go with the ayam bakar.

And they make it easy for us to eat the fish (we had the fried ones) because they separated the meat from the body, it is served on top of the bones. I mean, thoughtful. It's not spicy like in general in Bali. The happy soda (Es Soda Gembira) is generous!

The place is clean and nice, plants are nicely arranged, by the paddy field, although it can be a bit noisy because it's by the main road. Service is okay, serving is quite fast, price is good. When it's busy, maybe parking can be a bit of a problem. They have yoga and meditation classes occasionally.","the gurame nyat nyat was delicious, we also had fried shrimp which is super good. the service is fast and the price is affordable too.

Not too crowded and very cheap (only IDR25.000 during weekend & IDR10.000 at weekdays) the food is good & they also have great selection of coffee & juice. Reccomended for rest area especially you're travelling to North of Bali with kids üëçüëçüëç,"nice place for your kids, located near Mangusada Hospital. I ordered aglio olio fettucine, french fries and garlic bread. Aglio Olio is too spicy for me, I love the garlic bread here.

plus thing is this place have kids club and we only pay once then our kids can play for whole day","Tuesday 1st may 2018, I'm here and it's a nice place for a casual atmosphere, hanging out with a menu of western menus, and I like my menu choices, sandwiches with fries, drinking capucino ice, love to be here.","...A family resto with strategic location, cozy place, ambience atmosphere,  a lot of choices from light meals to heavy meals,  snack,  and other drinks,  but limited parking lot (roadside),  A perfect place to hang out with family,  friends or colleagues...","Bad experience. We visited this place craving for Western food, but when we were ready to order it occurred that they don't have any salads, mashed potatoes, cream soups, beef steaks, so basically what they had was rice, chicken and french fries (you can get this on every corner in Bali). I ended up with spaghetti carbonara that they did have, and they brought me plain spaghetti with creamy sauce. When I asked where is ham they said there's no ham in their receipt of carbonara (greedy indonesian receipt I guess).

On the end of this we received a receipt with 10% of service charge, that wasn't mentioned in their menu. In my opinion asking extra money ""for service"" when you don't have 80% of the dishes from menu is absolutely rude.

I recommend this place only for perverts who want to eat chicken rice and pay  western price."
