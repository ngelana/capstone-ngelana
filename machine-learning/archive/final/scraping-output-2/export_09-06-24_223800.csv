I just stopped for a coffee and he brought me a plate of fried banana, raw brown sugar, and honey. Everything is handmade right there, where they grow the different trees. The sugar was absolutely insane and delicious with the coffee. I ended up staying for an hour chatting to the guy and he told me all about the stuff they grow, how they grow it, and how they process it. Also gave me different fruits from their trees to try (not sure about their names, never had them before), and gave me some to take with me on my way. Only charged me for the coffee. Highly recommend.","Great rest stop on the way to sekumpul.

Very friendly owner who served and walked me around the
fresh produce from his surrounding farm, including the lovely goats and animals !

Food is quite good cos its organically grown and they even provide pretty good massage service next door.

Be sure to support him before you head to Sekumpul waterfall.","Njoman is a really lovely host and a great chef! We got here in pouring rain and he welcomed us so nice. We ordered chicken soup, fried rice and ginger tea- honestly everything was super tasty and so fresh. At the end he even gave us some fruits to try and we had a nice chat.

Thank you so much ðŸ˜Š
