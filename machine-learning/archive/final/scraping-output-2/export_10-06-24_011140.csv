It's a place where the flavors of Bali come alive, offering a taste that's as rich as the island's culture. A meal here isn't just food; it's a journey through the best of Balinese seafood, one that's sure to leave you craving more.üê†üç≤","This restaurant is recommended by many local residents. Apart from the advantages obtained from the freshness of the raw ingredients, the chili sauce served is also very appetizing. We tried the steamed fish and Sauce Padang clams. We like everything.

However, there still needs to be improvements in terms of service to make it more alert and friendly. apart from that everything is as expected.","It was one of my favorite local seafood restaurants in Bali a few years ago. However, during my last visit, I was a bit disappointed.

First, regarding cleanliness, I found a cockroach that came from under the plate on the table, and my wife found dead flies in our white rice. These two incidents probably ruined my appetite that day.

Second, regarding taste, as I remembered, the sensation, freshness, and seasoning were way better a few years ago. They were still quite good, but not as good as before.

Third, regarding access to get there at night, it was darker and had become more silent than before.

Overall, the taste was okay but not as special as before.","Great Seafood place at Serangan island Bali. First time come but were very surprised with the quality of food, place is busy, food all delicious and had a great sambalüëå

The foods, however, are the stars of this place. Fresh and tasty, just the perfect requirements for a seafood restaurant. Even the side dishes were delicious.

Recommended!",Had the seafood fried rice after visiting the turtle museum next door. The food is average for the price. They got a chilli station but I dunno what they are.,"Very nice seafood restaurant. You can pick from their open aquarium.
Delicious, my recommends are the lobsters and the fried fish.","The place is very spacious, there are indoor, outdoor and VIP rooms which are separated into several rooms.  All the food is delicious, fresh and feels exclusive.  My recommendation is fried shrimp and squid, very seasoned and sprinkled with lots of fried garlic, the stir-fried vegetables are very smoky and crunchy, cooked briefly over high heat.  They hv lot of great photo spots too.  But unfortunately the road to the restaurant starting from the Serangan intersection is rather dark, there are no street lights, the side is a river but there is no safety on the side, so it's a bit risky when driving at night."
