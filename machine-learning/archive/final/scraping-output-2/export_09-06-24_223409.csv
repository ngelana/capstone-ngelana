Now I think the place better than before because of rain the plants and trees covering this place. Sightseeing all around here is pretty awesome... The track not really hard...
Better go here around 4 or 5 pm... You will get nice photos due to the perfect lights üòú","Be very careful if you decide to go here, the road was terrible in October 2021 and too treacherous to ride. Could not ride scooter up a very steep hill with damaged road so going was a waste of time. If going around this time give it a miss",A dam with excellent mountain and sea view. Located on the slopes of Buleleng mountains. Not big. Small but catchy.,"The place is too beautiful to see
So that if you have free time don't forget to visit this destination"
