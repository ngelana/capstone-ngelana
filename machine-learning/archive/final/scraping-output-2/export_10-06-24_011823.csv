We felt very comfortable. There is a nice corner behind the pool for yoga and meditation. We used the pool for swimming in the morning. You should try their breakfast as well ! We recommend this accommodation!,"Nice enough place, but many little things that just weren‚Äôt ok. Room not fully prepared, booked a room with TV but couldn‚Äôt connect to Netflix due to internet issues, pool area very basic, service none excising  as there is  no staff on site. Some items on breakfast menu not available, kitchen locked after breakfast so only cold coffee available, no milk and and and.The location is very, very remote. Should be marketed as Air BnB at best.","I went trough the 1 Start reviews, it‚Äôs funny what things people complain about, terrible. This place is amazing, nice staff, nice pool and garden area. Love it.","ATTENTION - ongoing construction!
The manager Zuzana refunded us 50% of the price of the accommodation that we requested (she didn't offer it) and asked me to take the review into account. However, this doesn't change the fact that it would at least be appropriate to inform the guests that the house next door is currently being renovated and very noisy!!

From eight o'clock in the morning, jackhammers were pounding right behind our heads, so much so that the wall was shaking. Even over the weekend. Earplugs didn't help. After asking if it would be possible to at least change the room, we were directed to the garden house :)) I consider it a shame not to include this information and thus spoil the vacation of people who are looking forward to this beautiful destination and have made a long journey and invest to nice accommodation. Manager Zuzana is unprofessional and wrote me personal and insulting messages to my private phone number. It destroys all the efforts of the staff, who, on the other side, are very kind and helpful. The manager should learn kindness from the Balinese. I am from the Czech Republic and I am ashamed  for such behavior of Czech manager.","Can‚Äôt recommend this villa enough. The rooms are huge. The garden is absolutely gorgeous. Well located to the new beach clubs in southern peninsula of Uluwata like White Rock, Tropical Temptations, Minoo and many more. You need to get a grab or use a scooter to go to most places, as that‚Äôs cheap and easy. The slightly rural location makes it very quiet. Perfect. The breakfast quality is superb. I recommend the English breakfast. Excellent value for money."

We just popped down for the night and really loved the place, beautiful pool and nice new rooms. There isn‚Äôt much nearby from a food perspective but grab/gojek were awesome. Nice and close to the beach clubs. The team on reception were super friendly and helpful üòä","A stunning property with wonderful staff! We booked this place because it was affordable and the pool was gorgeous. We had a comfortable stay for three nights, our room was tidied everyday, the staff were always kind & helpful and the two resident doggies are so cuuute!
The only thing that can be improved on is the cleanliness of the shared kitchen area and the bathrooms in the villas. It just needs a deep clean.

This location is great if you‚Äôre wanting something affordable, that‚Äôs close to the beach yet in a quiet area. There are many cafe‚Äôs, restaurants and marts nearby (not walkable but around 5-10min by bike).","Spent one week in this hotel. Nice vibe, beautiful territory, rooms are modern and stylish. As I see this hotel just opened, because second floors are still not finished and are not available for rent.
Every evening we spent hours and hours with friends outside and it was such a big pleasure to be outdoor. Big like to open kitchen!","Wonderful place! Totally new, beautiful pool and great outdoor bar zone! VERY CLEAN!!! I don‚Äôt know how they maintain such a big totally white area so clean, good job!
The only thing is absence of full body size mirror, but manager promised us buy it till our next visit )
Recommend!","Big villa is super nice! Owners made it for themselves, and you can see that clearly. Best working place that you can imagine, couldn‚Äôt find anything like this on Bali, when you are working in IT working place and internet are super important. So you will be lucky if will catch it free))

For one week we also tried room in hotel, was also nice, but hope they will open second floors soon. On second floors sealings are super high and ocean view is amazing.

Recommend!!! Specifically for people who works online"

A good place for honeymooners. So quite & peaceful.  Woke up with the sounds of roosters & cow bells. Love it!!
Have a very good wifi connections, made our stay even better..
Will definitely come again and stay longer.","A cozy and comfortable villa, with great access to some wonderful beaches in Bali. Very recommended for honeymooners","We were very disappointed with this house! When we already negotiated renting this villa, arrive  there and in a last minute the owner told us that she decided not to give it for rent to us.
Be careful if you rent this property, because the owner can throw you out like a homeless dog whenever she sees fit.
It‚Äôs horrible behaviour, not appropriate!",Quiet and cozy private space. Ideal for a romantic weekend. Very close to some of Bali's upscale beach clubs.
