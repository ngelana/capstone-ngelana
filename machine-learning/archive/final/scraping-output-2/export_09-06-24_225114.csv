Hesitant to do a review because this place needs to be kept secret.
Wonderful staff
Very clean
Amazing food!!!
5* all the way",Best hotel in Munduk area. Not too big but very comfortable. It will give you the feeling of sleeping in the nature. There's a big and green rice field in front of the hotel which makes everything becomes prettier. Rooms are clean and comfortable. They have a suite room with kitchen and all rooms are facing the rice field. They have restaurant and pool facing the rice field as well. Very recommended. Nice staffs.,"Beautiful little gem in a lovely setting... Six individual bungalows overlooking rice fields with longer sweeping hillside views almost all the way to the ocean ðŸ¤© It was overcast on the evenings we were there (rainy season) so we only got teasers of sunsets, but I bet they are spectacular given the right conditions! Stunning hikes starting right from your doorstep, including a special riverside swimming spot with trickling waterfalls for a refreshing dip! The spot, Tibuan Sande, translates as the natural river formation of Sande (the local area, a sub-area of Gesing Village)! Trekking all the way to the waterfalls of Munduk (Melanting, Labuhan Kebo, Golden Valley, etc) is also possible from here. Staff on-site were super friendly and helpful. The rooms had some small maintenance issues but that seems reasonable given the ongoing global situation and will hopefully be addressed to keep the place as desirable add it is. Thank you for a special weekend in Sande - we will be back!","One of the best spots in Bali . Beautiful view and the people were amazing. Food was amazing. Itâ€™s a must go to place if you visit Munduk,  Bali.","for the staff is quite good
but for the room it's not good like the cockroach in the drawer
moldy cupboards, dust everywhere, hot water problems,"

We ordered a cup of coffee and a cup of tea.
At our suprise we also received a delicious sweet tasting snack for free (1/2 of the snack in the picture).

Location of Sande Coffee Break is one meter away from the rice fields. So an amazing view when enjoying your coffee or thea (different flavor options for both).

After your break you can walk through the rice fields.
This will only take about 30 minutes from start to finish (if you don't stop all the time for taking beautiful pictures).","Lovely  place to watch the rice fields and is owned by a family. I just stopped for coffee but ended staying several hours, felt a really nice atmosphere while hearing the owners playing with their child.","This cafÃ© is truly fantastic! We enjoyed the perfect Luwak coffee, and the terrace offers a breathtaking view of the rice fields during sunset. Highly recommended! The owner is also an excellent guide with a wealth of knowledge about the area. We did the jungle and canoe trek with him, and it was truly amazing!","The Hidden Gem in Munduk . If you are in Munduk seen waterfall and all. You need to be here just give cherry on top for your trip. It is simple cafe run by a very sweet family Salamat his wife and too beautiful kids. The location is to die for right next to huge luss green rice field. Evening you see sunset if weather is fine . They also sell some spices and salamat is guide and trek orginizer too if you need the service . I visit thrice in my short stay here. They serve various teas like jasmine, hibiscus ðŸŒº etc long with local coffee and beer . They donâ€™t have anything to eat just have banana fitter but they are yup with the tea and view .",I had a delicious cup of Jasmine tea while overlooking the beautiful rice fields below! It was stunning. Quiet little spot run by a very sweet family. Cannot recommend this place more! I hope to return some day!
