The cliff area itself can get exposure to direct sun during afternoon outdoor  ceremonies, making it too hot for the guests sometimes. During july august, the wind can be too strong and cold for outdoor events. Otherwise the ocean view is very beautiful and the villas are awesome.","A place where your precious moment will be so dramatically memorable.. beautiful scenery on earth. Staff are good , delicious food.. south part of the island..
the architectur are so beautiful.. but because of the landscape, its not disability friendly, lots of steps.. everywhere.. not good for elderly  and small children.
other than that, this resort is very recommended.","What a fabulous place! I attended a wedding here so didn‚Äôt have the chance to stay but grounds, staff and quality of everything was exceptional.","Amazing,, very beautiful place at bali,, love it, if i have a time i want to go to this place again, thank you for the beautiful moment here"
