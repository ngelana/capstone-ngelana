The bathroom could use a new light and the Wifi is not the best‚Ä¶ otherwise we had a good stay there.,"It‚Äôs like a 20 min drive by scooter from all the main locations but that makes it a peaceful place. The staff are so friendly and the atmosphere is incredible. It‚Äôs also very welcoming, it feels very homey"

Nice atmosphere and this warung serves the best portion size ever! Recommend. I think the chicken fried rice was 30k üëç,"Lovely family-owned little restaurant. They don't speak English and they only make the traditional Indonesian dishes.

When we arrived it was closed, we asked ""halo?!"" and a young lady opened up for us (and more costumers also joined later).
The atmosphere is very authentic.","This is a really nice place to eat! They don't have a menu and don't even speak english, but you can use your Google Translate to order whatever you want or make it easy and ask for a Mie Goreng (the portion is massive and it's really good!). Don't forget to say very clear NO SPICY if you don't want your tounge to be incineratedüòÖ",Massive portions at a very affordable price. We came here twice during our stay at Klumpu area. She doesn‚Äôt rly have a fixed menu when we cave (prolly bc covid) so you kinda just order whatever you want and she‚Äôll fix it in her kitchen if she has the ingredients. All of our orders came out amazing. Get her sambal tomat!,The food was nice but it was (for Bali standards) very expensive. About 60k per meal. The shipowner was really kind though.

Bayu is very friendly, honest and helpful. He did a great job with reasonable price, i think we got way more than what we paid.
He is very considerate, he did little small things for us without asking.

I definitely recommend Bayu for anyone coming to Nusa Penida. ‚ù§Ô∏è",,,,
