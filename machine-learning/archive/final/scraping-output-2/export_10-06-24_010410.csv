Affordable.
Note:
Please upgrade the knife.

The service is the best 100%

Recommended, you should try!","For 200gr tenderloin, with option of fries/ wedges/ mash, sauces and drink, only cost 55k. The price is so affordable if you want to have steak without spending too much.
The taste might be scored 7/10. But... yeah, it is cheap!","Absolutely loved my experience at WAGYUMAN! The place is spotless, the food tastes amazing, and the menu has something for everyone. The staff were super friendly and made the whole dining experience even better. Definitely coming back for more! Highly recommend!","All the foods are very mouthwatering. Rib-eye Steaks serve with hot plate, meats very soft‚ù§Ô∏è , we requested for Medium-Rare, the sauces are very delicious, I picked black pepper sauce and my friend picked mushrooms sauce. We also can choose what kind of potatoes we want.
But in some part, the hot plate too hot, so the veggies are over-burnt. The ice tea is too sweet for me. We also ordered truffle beef pasta, the taste similar with Aglio Olio but with additional truffle taste (free 1 drink if order this menu). End up we had 3 drinks üòÇü§≠","The place was easy to find, next to Kantor Pos. I like the steak, rib eye cut with saut√© veggies. The vegetables are good, still crunchy but fine. The brown sauce isn't really recommended, the only taste is ""rasa tepung"" or the starch, which is not tasty at all. It takes around 30 minutes to get the food, a bit longer with only few visitors dining in. The price is fine, still affordable for a plate of steak. A steak (tenderloin/sirloin/rib eye) served with a condiment (fries/potato wedges/rice) and the sauce (they have 5 kinds) with a beverage (tea/still water) charge IDR 60k, including tax 10%. They have other food like spaghetti, fish and chips, the side dishes and beverages are various.
The seats are many, upstairs or downstairs seats. The place is comfy, nice, clean.
If you are a steak lover, or wanna try a steak for thr first time, come and have a visit!"

We were able to enjoy the pool with the children, the kitchen/bathroom is very spacious, and we brought the chairs from the balcony so that the little ones could eat in the kitchen.

The staff is a bit cold but that's probably due to the language barrier, our room was cleaned countless times even though it was supposed to be 1x per week which is also very nice.

Far from the beaches, but very close to a supermarket and many warungs. There's also a kid's playground 5min walk away, and we had fun at the Denpasar mall.

Very good experience, hoping the pool will be functional again.",Location is 20min far from the beach and not a comfy area. The service ist very nice and helpful but there are still some points which are very disappointing. Light is very cold and it doesn‚Äôt give you enough atmosphere. No desk lamp.

Pretty spacious room with spacious bathroom in separate door inside. The lighting inside the room could be improved. The wall and furniture look old and refurbished.
Better for longer stay since they don't provide shampoos and amenities.
No cooking appliances.
Provide towels and clean linens.
The wifi is very slow and sometimes disappears.
Not too close from beaches or hip restaurant s. Must be able to arrange your own travel while staying there.
Enough comfortable stay if you don't need luxuries.","Lovely quiet location but close to all amenities large pool and nice tended gardens. Rooms are large and well maintained with large storage room, wardrobe, and bathroom to the rear. I think a lot of the negative coments are a case of ""champagne tastes on lemonade money"" for what the rooms cost this is a fantastic place to stay.","I would definitely not recommend staying at Pondok Cintya. The outside area and the pool are nice, but that's it. The room itself needs to be renovated. There is mold on the walls, the furniture is old and partly broken and most of all, the place is just not clean at all (even though a 'cleaning service' is provided)."
