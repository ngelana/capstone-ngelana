Tembuku, Kabupaten Bangli, Bali 80671, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=2110109766359369332,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3908-8131,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.7,332,,"The way to the waterfalls is such idyllic and grounding. Not many tourists, so you can enjoy the beauty without any crowds. There's a part where you have to pass a long narrow cave which is absolutely dark. Could probably be a problem for people with claustrophobia or arachnophobia.","Low-key, underrated waterfall as it’s at a very short distance to more commercialized waterfall. The surrounding area is clean and I meet with the guy who is doing the daily up keeping. He made a firewood to keep the mosquitos away. But during my second visit, there was no campfire and I had no problem with mosquitos. There is not many people so I can enjoy serenity and nature. Don’t expect a modern facilities there. The main waterfall is a nice place to hang around and climb if you have the courage. Explore the inner part of the river to find the deeper part to swim in and enjoy the rapid stream to give you a push to float! The added value is the walk through a wonderful rice fields. A little climb/descent, of course it’s Bali, what else is new. Going through the Netherlands tunnel was also an interesting experience.

The place is perfect for not wanting to be in jammed packed place and enjoy nature to its fullest extent.

Entrance fee at IDR 25,000/person","Such beautiful waterfall and hospitable people! A very friendly guy guided us to discover the full beauty of this place, we ventured through different little canals where you could swim like in a water park. It felt like a spa having water splashed onto your back and you could also do meditation there. The entrance ticket was also reasonable price, ours was 25k. However, you need to walk for around 25min through the beautiful rice terrace first to get to the waterfall. Totally recommend it!!","Beautiful, accessible cave Waterfall with a small pool. Not overly packed. Nice moderate walk to get to the Waterfall.","Wonderful spot... Very natural and not a lot of people. Love this place, but please be aware you need to walk on rice fields, then on a big stair in the jungle for like 15min"

As usual, there are steep steps to get down to the river. Then you follow the current so having shoes for walking in water is recommended. Nice jungle scenery, mostly clean, quiet. At the waterfall you can get to the falling water but there is no place to swim.
This is not a very touristy place yet, a very natural environment, good to be able to find spots like this.
You may be tempted to follow the river further but we were told that this is not recommended as this area is not visited by people so you may meet local fauna there.
As you are in the valley of the mountain river the flash flooding is possible. Coming in the rain season may be dangerous or not even possible.","come here if you want to be alone with nature rather than fight for a photo spot with other tourists:) For 20.000 i.e. £1 you will get two waterfalls in one, canyon and a hike. The best of all when we went around 3 pm there was no-one else there, and when we left even the guy selling tickets was gone haha. You will get a bamboo stick to help you wade through the stream, it is useful to measure the depth but not really needed. Enjoy!","Two awesome waterfalls. Access is from the small Moped car park down a few steps. A bamboo walking stick is offered for protection.  This is not absolutely necessary, but is helpful later to feel the water depths through which you have to wade later.
There are two waterfalls, both have their special features. At the smaller one, the water falls beautifully onto a block below, where you can position yourself for photos. The larger waterfall cascades down a lava stone wall and is also a stunning subject!  Because these falls are less well-known, there are fewer tourists than at Cepud Falls, a few minutes away.
Entry was currently Rp 20,000 per person.",Fantastic waterfall! I would highly recommend it for the thrill of it. We walked through some beautiful rice fields to get to it by foot,"One of the two waterfalls next to each other. Absolutely great and not touristy at all. We walked through the rice fields before ""climbing"" down some old stairs. Be aware, leeches in the river. Was okay with two 4&6 year olds but an adventure;)"

Nicely BBQed with a portion of rice, sambal, and veggies (tomato wedges & cucumber) on the side. Great place to stop by either before or after visiting the waterfall.","We had to ask the store across the street to find the cook, who turned out to be asleep in back, but are we glad we did. The food was excellent!  The guy cooked is some of the best chicken and noodles as well as fried we've had to date.

No English is spoken here, so be prepared. Also it's by the road, so no real atmosphere.",I went there with my friends after visiting the waterfalls. Very nice place! The food was delicious and fresh. The owner was very friendly and helpful.,"Big portion of tasty food for local price, pleasant people, we sure enjoyed having our dinner here","stumbled upon this place while going on a trip to goa raja waterfall, didn't have much expectations but wow, totally exceeded it. generous portion, very good taste, friendly too, delicious!!! I ordered fried rice and fried noodle"
