The entire complex is very calm and gives very peaceful vibes. The entrance gate is very beautiful. Balinese temples require a specific dress code, without which, entry may be prohibited. A sarong is to be tied around the waist before entering the temple. These sarongs can be rented from the security post of the temple for IDR 20,000. Before you enter the temple you need to pay a fee of¬†30,000 Indonesian rupiah¬†and must wear a sarong which is inclusive in the entrance fee. Most of the temples in Indonesia has similar designs but the history is different for each of the statues.","Pura Dalem Puri, a hidden gem in Bali, encapsulates spiritual serenity. Nestled within lush surroundings, this temple radiates an ancient mystique, inviting introspection. The intricate carvings and ornate architecture showcase Balinese craftsmanship at its finest. Pura Dalem Puri's calm ambiance provides a respite from the bustling outside world. Devotees and visitors alike find solace in its sacred energy. While it might lack the grandeur of larger temples, its intimate setting and spiritual resonance make it a meaningful stop. Pura Dalem Puri embodies Bali's spiritual essence, creating a unique and tranquil experience for those seeking a deeper connection with the island's cultural roots.","One of the oldest temple in Bali; some people call it as mother temple. One of the calm place. We have visited on the early morning and it was Soo calm. As per our guide, there are many small temples for each communities/caste in this place. There is a dedicated parking facility available. You have to buy a ticket to enter this place. Ticket includes a sarong and a guide to help to roam around the place.","It is apart of Besakih Complex Temple,especially for the seoul of humans matters. Even, related to the heaven spirit and deva.

A great place to visit","It was my fourth visit with my family to this sacred temple. Pura Dalem Puri is one of the Besakih temple complexes .Hindus people in Bali believe  this  temple is a visualization of the existence of heaven and hell ,in accordance  with the concept of  Hindus Shiva Sidhanta's . It was such a nice visit with my whole family, the temple was clean, sacred place with such a mystical vibes, we will definitely pray to Pura Dalem Puri again in very near future.."

Stuck high in the mountains in the middle of no man's land next to the Besakhi Temple - the reason we were there - is a little hotel of Balinese Villas where reception phones are ignored, the caretaker had a poor grasp of English, no restaurant except for Breakfast brought to the room which were inedible rubber pancakes and fritters. No transport and the only thing to eat during the day or night was a 2 km walk for street cart food. Buildings in poor maintenance with big cracks in timber slats ensured my wife was eaten alive by mosquitoes. Paths were mossy and slippery - couldn't tell the last time they were cleaned which resulted in my feet sliding from under me and landing flat on my back hitting my head on the way down with quick blackout and seeing the stars. Being unable to get transport out and still another night of horror remaining, we called a bluebird taxi from Dempasar to come and rescue us thus forfeiting the money already spent on the next nights accommodation. Truly the very worst one star experience out of many nights spent travelling around Bali over the past 3 weeks including stays in Sanur, Nusa Penida, Sanur, Ubud, Tulamben,  Bersakhi, Sulis Beach and Kuta.
Lift your game and show some hospitality if you are going to take the tourism hospitality business seriously.
Lucky to even get ONE Star.  It is a Zero star rating from me.","Wonderful location and beautiful view! People are also really nice, it looks like this is a family business but I think they got hit really bad because of Covid... room and bed smelled like mold, there is zero soundproofing so you hear everything from outside and it's impossible to get good night sleep.
Surroundings of the bungalow are not well maintained and dated.
People are nice though, breakfast wasn't bad. If you want to support family business and you are looking for beautiful view from the pool - you can give it a try but we were a little disappointed.","Good view and big pool but that's where the pros end.

the houses are right on the road, there is no soundproofing - when a bike or a truck passes by, it feels like they are going right at you.  inside everything is old, the wet bed smells of mold, the air conditioner does not work correctly.  I do not advise.",Just a few minutes walk from the temple entrance. Breakfast is ordered the night before and bought to the bungalow. evening meals can be ordered from the very good restaurant a few minutes away,This is such a wonderful place. Very kind service. Completely beautiful setting. A favorite in Bali. I was sad to leave. Hope to come back some day.
