From the moment we arrived, we were blown away by the breathtaking views of the rice fields and mountains. The house itself was absolutely beautiful, with a perfect blend of modern design and traditional Balinese architecture.","Definitely me new place to stay in Jatiluwih.
The attention to detail in every aspect of the house was exceptional. The bedrooms were spacious and comfortable, with luxurious bedding and beautiful views. The bathrooms were modern and immaculately clean. The living areas were perfect for relaxing and enjoying the stunning surroundings.","We recently had the pleasure of staying at this exceptional house in Jatiluwih and it was truly an unforgettable experience. The house was located in a peaceful and serene setting, enclosed by lush green rice fields and remarkable mountain views.",Best place to stay! The villas is amazing and the staff is so kind. This traditional house is really wonderful. The river side lunch is a great addition. you feel like time has stops and you're in heaven. We'll come back real soon for sure.,"Imagine a century old beautiful fairy tale house with antique furniture but quality modern fittings in the middle of a remote village, jungle and magnificent rice terraces with a beautiful garden with a pond and lotuses. From the villa there is a private scenic trail with spoiling views of the rice terraces and a place to relax by the mountain stream. There is no Wi-Fi in the villa, but for me it was only a plus for a complete detox from unnecessary information and unity with nature."
