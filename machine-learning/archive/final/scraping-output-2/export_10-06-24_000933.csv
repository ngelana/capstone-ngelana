Fresh air n the amazing rice paddy's view with tranquility place. Really recommended for you are missing the remote place to refresh n hilling away from your headache activities.

Location a bit inside of crowded area to reach,  but it's really worth it to visiting.","What an amazing experience at Clove Tree Hill.
The place is stunning, the rooms are gorgeous with a beautiful bathroom where you have the feeling you‚Äôre having your shower in the nature. You can eat delicious food looking at the rice terraces. The spa is very relaxing, you can get a great massage listening to the waterfall. Dian, Bram and Alit took care of us with so much dedication we are so grateful we got to meet this people and wish them the best. I hope someday we can come back again.
Do not hesitate to book your holidays at this hotel, you won‚Äôt regret it.","Clove Tree Hill is amazing!  The scenery is heavenly.   I highly recommend it for those who want to escape the buzz of the city.  Clove Tree Hill offers tranquility with nature while is a perfect opportunity to learn about local cultures and farming - you will experience the diverse farms such as rice, cocoa, coffee, coconut.  You will also get to see vanilla beans, nutmeg, durian fruit, jack fruit and much more.

I high recommend taking a guided tour on the 'green path' first.  Then take a hike on the red path solo - but make sure you take some water on this scenic journey.  You will experience some of the most incredible terraced rice fields and stroll through the village.

Make sure you go to the near by waterfall to cool off and take a dip in the refreshing water.  Take some money and buy yourself a beverage at stand near the waterfall.

I also recommend the massages.  They take place outdoor just above the stream with the waterfall so it is very relaxing.

The other must is taking the class on making coconut oil.  What a wonderful experience taught by Dian's grandmother.

The dinners were really good.  I tried many Balinese and Indonesian meals that were unfamiliar to me and all of them were really good.  The homemade chocolate ice cream is by far the best I have ever had - this is a must!

The whole staff and Dian are excellent hosts.  I can't wait to return.","Clove tree hill is the cutest little place in the middle of nature. I never experienced Bali the way I did here, ate the most delicious food, met the loveliest staff and saw the beautiful surroundings! - If anyone is looking at a place where you can calm down, enjoy a peaceful time in nature and get pampered, you‚Äôre at the right place.

In the Bungalows you have privacy, luxury and beautiful views and everyone is trying to make your time the best possible.

Must try: Gado gado, mahi mahi fish, tuna steak and chocolate ice cream

Ps. Definitely book a massage and try the activities offered, it‚Äôs well worth it üôèüèΩ","We had a good time at Clove Tree Hill resort. Set amidst rice fields, this place gives you a feeling of being in a jungle as you are surrounded by greenery from all sides. People here are welcoming and made us feel at home. Special thanks to Dian & Bram for making our stay comfortable. The food here is delicious and they had decent vegetarian options for us to try. One can go explore waterfall nearby or take a walk amidst rice fields. This was a perfect end to our holiday as we relaxed away from city life. I would recommend anyone looking for that escape from city vacation to give this place a try."
