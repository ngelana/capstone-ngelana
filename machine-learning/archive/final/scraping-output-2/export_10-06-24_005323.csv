Great, friendly staff, beautiful room, great pool, a small gym! Shared kitchen access was cute and social. Location was a little rural, but I really appreciated getting to see ""real"" Bali and motorbike booking was super easy through the staff.","Absolutely amazing wonderful place! I just arrived and went to swim üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  room is really beautiful, nice plants everywhere and it's werry calm here. I asked for laundry so they provided it to me and will bring next day. You have water here, can make tea or coffee. Also there is lots of restaurants around where you can order food. Friendly staff and little gym upstairs. Perfect ü•∞","Cheerful and helpful staff. Clean rooms, budget friendly. What else can you want? Free kitchen use and free tea and coffee. Thank you Novita and Jess. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèª","We found the place through airbnb, but the application had different offers that weren't even real like they had 2 rooms for the price of 1 but when we visit the place they had 1 room for the price of 2 rooms everything was fully booked but airbnb said that there was space","I was absolutely in love with this homestay. For a low price we were getting an excellent, big and clean room with really cool designed bathroom, small balcony surrounded by greens and with pool view. There was also a small kitchen for everyone, which was clean and had all necessary cooking utensils.
The stuff was beyond nice and friendly.
Yeah, the location is a bit far from Ubud, 30 mins drive, but u can rent a bike from neighbours and go explore beautiful nature and authentic streets around.
Keep in mind that the property doesn't provide any food tho!"

Although located direct to the street, they have a lush garden where kids can play. Had tipat cantok which was very good, you can choose how many chilies you want in your sauce‚Ä¶","Randomly bumped upon this place when checking out nearby restaurants. Foods were fine & price was very reasonable. Dropping a review since I enjoyed their Es Teler so much!! It's 20k (which can be considered rather expensive compared to their other food prices), but it's worth every penny. Easily one of the best Es Teler I've had in Bali~ My first impression was, ""Oh, it seems so good, look at that big avocado piece!"", but I was surprised even more when I scooped & mixed it. It was full of toppings with plenty of fruits too. Unlike how in some other places they served more jellies compared to fruits, the components were very balanced here. Oh, it's also my first time seeing an Es Teler lacking ice because it's full of toppings HAHAHAH but don't worry, you can ask for extra ice to the staffs if you feel it's not cold enough.

We also ordered Jamur Crispy, Rujak Gula Pasir, and a few plates of Tipat, and they were all quite tasty. The surrounding is also nice if you're looking for a peaceful place to have lunch at. Thank you for the good foods. ü•∞",Amazing place and delicious food ! I tried Bulung kuah pindang for the first time .. it was so good crunchy and like caviar.. staff really kind and friendly ..,"they serve common, well-cooked indonesian and balinese foods ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•",Good food!

The staffs are very friendly as well.",Took a course here for 2 weeks. The farm food is harvested from the farm and used for cooking and the place is absolutely beautiful and wonderful!,"Very disappointed by the attitude of the person who we met today. We had traveled for over 90 minutes to come and see the bamboo classes to see if it was something we would later pay (a lot of money) to undertake. Instead of a welcoming and offering to show us around, Maria, was stand offish and suggested we looked on the website! I find this staggering considering we have travelled from the UK and made the trip especially to see the place in person! This is not the approach I expected and has made me certain that we will not be coming back.","We did a tour of Kul Kul farms and loved it! Maria was a great tour guide because she was very knowledgeable and passionate about permaculture and the farm itself! If you‚Äôre on the fence about going, you definitely should! I had a wonderful experience and feel I have learned so much just from time we spent on the farm. After the guided tour, we were lead to a buffet of delicious food that was mainly straight from the farm! Loved everything about it! 10/10","We have travelled out of our way to come to kulkul farm thinking we will meet likeminded people, kind and passionate about their work, to be welcomed by Maria at the reception, in a very hostile and rude manner. I am very disappointed to have traveled so far to be advised to have a look on their Instagram. After years of following their instagram I am beyond disappointed to find out that the place is ran by such an acrimonious person."
