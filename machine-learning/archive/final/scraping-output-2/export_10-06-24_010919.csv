The hosts were incredibly welcoming, but the only issue was the language. As a foreign travelers we only know english but the service girls only know balanies and indonesian. During our stay my bathroom door got stuck and it was too difficult for us to convey the issue due to this language barrier.","I have booked one night for special occasion to celebrate birthday party. We were surprise by towel art decoration in the room. The room is pretty small, the size like XS, it has small bathroom & I noticed the headboard is weird please mind your head. My big concern is cleanliness inside the elevator and some amenities like toothbrush & toothpaste and mineral water on the floor of elevator.",Good hotel located near sanur. Location is pretty hard to reach because of the small 2 lane road. Got a decent room for a fair price.,"Dirtyyyy all over from the lobby until the room!!!  Go somewhere else!! With this price you can have better!! No towel, i dont think they change the bedsheets and pillowcases!!! ( we know what price we paid but this is unacceptable) luckily we always travel with our own towels, bedsheets and pillow cases !!","The check in was quick and we can enter our room in less than 20 min.
There is lift from grd floor to the room's floor.
But once you entered your room, you will feel very cramped. Room is very small. Just enough for a double bed. There is no place to put the big suitcase.
The room is old and rundown. Bathroom is made of glass & dirty. The worst thing is the towel. The rug in other hotel even whiter than the towel in this hotel.
The shower was not hot enough.
The aircond in the room (417) was so noisy.
Maybe the only normal thing in the hotel is the wifi.
This is the hotel for those only looking for a very cheap room to spend the night without expecting other things."

When I arrived, I immediately saw the dirty bed with blood stains on it and some cockroaches in the bathroom. Since I was only planning to stay one night I decided to put up with it. I asked for a bug spray but they said they did not have any.

Rio, the guy who is in charge for the maintenance of the rooms, the cleaning and general service is kind, reliable and always responsive, we had some minor problems here and there and he has always been  fast and responsive and at the end he always solved the issues we had.
Overall I would advice to reserve here since the prices are good.","The room itself looks good, but in detail it appears to be moldy and with a lot of ants (compared to other similar houses). Also I feel scammed as they require me to pay for electricity I do not use (5-6 kWatt/h a day WITHOUT AC is extremely huge). They give a small bottle of water at the beginning, but couldn't organize the water delivery service, which is common in Bali. Service seems absent, and real facilities differ from what's written in Airbnb.
Good wifi though.
Could be better if not the electricity scam.",,,

I recommend this to all that loves chicken!,"This place is fantastic. Though it isn‚Äôt a restaurant and it isn‚Äôt a warung, it is a yummy place to get some quality rice dishes!

My partner and I were craving some Chinese rice-y dish and were looking for something nearby. We found The Ong and realized it was so close to us in Sanur. We quickly WhatsApped them and ordered the Korean Honey Chicken because we were so hungry and boy did it hit the spot! The flavor was perfect and the chicken was still crispy. It was served with some white rice along with a sunny side egg and pickled vegetables.

The menu is quite limited but it‚Äôs perfect for a home establishment! All the items are mostly chicken and range between 30-35k which is a really great price for a lunch spot.

You can order grab and Gojek as it is mainly a takeaway place, but if you decide to pick up, you will arrive at someone‚Äôs home with the Ong Bali posted on a wall and the gate entry. You then arrive at a little parking area with some seatings outdoor for you to wait for your food.

We will definitely be back to check out the other dishes as all the reviews have been extremely positive!

Side note, I spoke to the chef and they do catering and pop ups so definitely check them out and be on the lookout!",We have eaten here for years and the food is always good! Always order on gojek and it‚Äôs fast and the price is good! Highly recommend.,"start of view from google mapsüì≤
