ChIJd2tyY2_10S0RciY-eB8I0dc,Black Lava,-8.2627635,115.37574999999998,"P9PG+V7, Central Batur, Kintamani, Bangli Regency, Bali, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=15551219919541380722,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.6,95,,"This place is not bad. You can go there on a Jeep to her. I only recommend to stay there for not very long time. This is usually included in the Jeep tour for the sunrise of Mount Victor. If I were to do it again, I probably would skip this but it's up to you if you want to check it out","Came here as part of the Jeep tour that my group booked. It isn’t much but sure is a sight to see, this was lava a long time ago and now has become this dune-like area.

When it gets misty, it sure becomes quite mystical, akin to a movie scene or a music venue shoot. Though beware as one can easily lose their bearings due to the formless surroundings especially when it gets misty.

Definitely worth a quick visit if you’re near the area.","For those who haven't been here, let's enjoy the beauty of good black lava and for those who like to take photos, here is an ok place to take photos","Nice views but not really that interesting, it’s just black rocks and some nice views but nothing compared to the views when on mount batur sunrise","Went there together with the Jeep Sunrise Local Tour and the area is quite remote, we have to reach there by the local JEEP driver.

View are incredible and love how raw this attraction spot is,  no tourisy-oriented infrastrure was made so you could really feel the uneven and rough rock ground. a must visit for every geology euthusiast."
