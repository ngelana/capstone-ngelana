I went here with my husband and small dog.

We had an amazing time during retreat ""Rooted within"". They had a very nice program with yoga, sound healing + energy healing, qigong. The nature is so beautiful, we recharged our bodies and souls.

Thanks for this amazing place and retreat. If you are thinking to go or not. Definitely go. It's quiet, rooms are very good.

Rooms are lean, staff is well trained and they answer and react very fast. Also, you can make nice photos there! Enjoy","What a retreat‚ú® From the moment I arrived, I felt a sense of peace by being surrendered by sooo much nature (literally greens as far as my eyes could see)

The accommodation was cozy, super clean, and extremely comfortable (best pillows and mattress of my entire time in bali). Each meal, from breakfast to dinner, was so good and we even had the chef to come out and tell us about the dishes. The highlight of my stay was the outdoor yoga classes and sound healing sessions, the views were unbelievable!! And also the extremely friendly staff that even brought back to Canggu a hat I forgot in the placeüôèüèΩ

Overall, the Bali Palms Soul Retreat exceeded my expectations in every way. I left feeling refreshed, renewed, and deeply grateful for the experienceüíõ","After over 13 years of calling Bali home, I've witnessed many changes that at times have left me feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from the essence of this beautiful island. However, my recent discovery of Bali Palm has been nothing short of transformative. From the moment my husband and I arrived for our soul retreat, we were enveloped in a sense of peace and tranquility that washed away my anxiety instantly. The warmth of the staff, the breathtaking views from our room, and the delightful homemade soaps all contributed to an unforgettable experience. And the rare treat of a perfect hot shower in such a secluded setting was a true luxury. Sharing delicious Indonesian dishes with fellow guests under the open sky was a highlight, but it was the Sound Healing session that truly touched my soul. The guru guided me through a journey of emotional regulation and energy purification, leaving me feeling cleansed and rejuvenated. I'm immensely grateful to the Gurus, particularly Christina, for their attentive care, and to Monika and Selena for their uplifting energy. Bali Palm has reconnected me with the true essence of Bali, and I wholeheartedly recommend it as your next Bali experience.üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª","Lovely small-scale resort with lovely people who want to give you a lovely stay.
Wonderful garden with places to get massages and a yoga place, there is a stream along with lovely sound of falling water during massage or yoga! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Also the food is a treat, morning afternoon and evening there is consideration for your food wishes and diet!
If you have wishes; (active,)they think with you and arrange the right people!
There is also a lovely swimming pool!
In short, our 4-day stay was unforgettable! Terima kasih! üôèüèº","Just finished a yoga retreat at Bali Palms and I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough. I‚Äôve lived in Bali for over a year and have never explored tabanan. It is a truly magical village nestled amounts the jungle and rice fields. The property is breath taking, a true oasis from the hustle and bustle of Canggu. My friend woke up this morning and said ‚Äúif I needed to come and write a book, this is where I would come‚Äù
The staff are absolutely amazing, and so funny! We stayed up late roasting marshmallows and playing card games. They made us feel at home in just two days of our stay. They have a fresh harvest with different fruits they pick every morning from their garden. This place feels like a slice of heaven. 15/10
Thank you so much Bali Palm! We will be back! :)"
