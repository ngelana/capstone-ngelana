Never many people, 3 different waterfall types, the walk down isn‚Äôt bad at all, going back up is tiring but always worth it. I‚Äôd guess it only takes about 20-25 mins to get back up.","Beautiful and lesser known must visit

Fees 40k less than 2$ (For maintenance, keeping  it safe and keep it clean )

Crowd  : Not well known hence you have entire waterfall to yourself hardly anyone comes.

Level : Easy to moderate has 400 steps sometime steep avoid if you have knee issue. Easy for moderately fit person . Go slow if you getting tired.

Has 4 waterfall (1 has very less water now in august)

1 you can swim too.

There is washroom and bike parking on the top.","Definitely underrated. People should come here. The access is very well maintained, including the stairs to go down the hill. Although the track is a bit challenging; rather longer and steeper than others in the area; the view is amazing and very pristine. There are 3-4 photo spots along the track, you can get instagrammable pictures here as well.

Ticket is 20k/person, but it's basically pay 1 get 3 waterfalls.

Bonus: Kiyul (the dog) was our super cute and energetic guide","The best waterfall I‚Äôve ever been to. Amazing. We had the whole place to ourselves. Massive wall of stairs to get in and out, so make sure you‚Äôve got good foot wear. Take your swimmers, as it‚Äôs so worth getting in under the big waterfall and feels its power! Namaste üôèüèΩ travellers!!","Really beautiful place‚Ä¶ beautiful waterfalls, 3 waterfalls at one place. Not many tourist, it was like having a private waterfalls‚Ä¶ the rain forest is just stunning‚Ä¶ with the mist come and go its just really beautiful‚Ä¶
The entrance fee is pricy.. i went with a group of 20 so we made bargain with the entrance fee. Good thing they agree."

The road to reach it is quite long about 1km from the moment you give the donation. So if you are not ready to walk, don‚Äôt do it :) the good part is that we were the only ones there!","A really cool waterfall to go and visit, I'd say there are definitely better ones around the area. 50,000 seemed a bit expensive for what was there.","hidden gem among the waterfalls in bali, we did not met any tourist, path leads trough untouched jungle, last 1 km you need to go by walking","a beautiful place, three waterfalls, but still difficult to access, the road is still being built, now the dirt road is about 1 km, you can‚Äôt ride a motorcycle for asphalt in the rain, you can walk, it‚Äôs dusty in the dry season, we are waiting for the road",Very good for those of you who want to camp near a waterfall
