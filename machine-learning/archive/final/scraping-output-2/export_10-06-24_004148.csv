We booked tickets online and simply showed our QR codes to enter – it was very easy. Once you enter, you’re surrounded by the beautiful forest. It’s a wonderful place to explore, with nice shady paths and huge towering trees. There were so many monkeys when we visited, it was hard to contain my excitement!

They're free to roam around wherever they like, and they can come and go whenever they like.

It's interesting to watch the monkeys interact with each other. They can come right up to you, so you’ll need to make sure you’re not carrying anything they like the look of like water bottles and food. We saw a few people fall victim to sneaky monkeys pinching things.

The monkeys are free to come and go as they please, but there are some monkeys that stay due to injuries and rehabilitation. Sacred Monkey Forest do lots of work with the monkeys to make sure they are well looked after and fed, hence why they stay around as they get the easy life.

If you're in Ubud and want to see some monkeys, this is the place to go. It's a fun and interesting experience - and is definitely worth a visit.","This was one of the first places we visited during our trip to Bali and it was a very nice experience.

We got to see monkeys fighting with each other, monkeys sitting next to guests and in general getting up to all sorts of stuff. There was some nice architecture as well that we got to see.

My wife wanted to take a monkey selfie but unfortunately, that was closed.

Overall, we had a good time here.","Wow!!!!
This was by fat my favourite place in Bali.
It was so easy to get to as it is very close to central Ubud.
The place seems easily accessible and wheelchair friendly, although there are lots of parts with many steps, so not all areas are wheelchair accessible.
The staff gave us a warm and friendly greeting, and there was no queue to purchase the very reasonably priced enyry tickets.
There are lots of signs detailing the rules and regulations, and everything you need to know to respect the monkeys and also to keep yourself safe.
There is a cloakroom where you can drop your bags, and I was pleasantly surprised that it was free and very secure.
The app that you downloaded for free was very informative and helpful, with a great map of the forest and had lots of useful information.
The highlight for me was a monkey  climbing on to me and grooming my hair!!!
It is a truly beautiful and magical place, and I would recommend it for all ages!!!
I will definitely be returning here!!",Very nice place right in the middle of ubud. The monkeys are very friendly but be aware of your belongings as they can steal from you. We were lucky to go there at lunch time so they were eating. Very intelligent creatures and the park is very well maintained.,"Beautiful jungle with lots of huge trees and temples. Incredible sculptures of animals throughout the temple complexes with so much diversity. The monkeys are fun to watch. They run are all over the place, adding a lot of excitement to the experience."

The temple itself was closed to the public ""for prayers and community only"" kinda deal. The Forest was pretty nice and there were ample cheeky monkeys to snap photos of.
One sneaky devil tried to unzip my backpack and was a bit upset when I stopped him. Recommend a small zip lock if you do take a backpack.","If you are looking for a tourist attraction other than the zoo where you can interact with the animals there (especially monkeys), this is the right place. There will be lots of monkeys roaming around you. Pay attention to your belongings, stay away from objects that are brightly colored or shiny so that monkeys don't take them. The monkeys here don't attack, but are sometimes mischievous. However, don't worry because there are lots of guards inside. This place is suitable to visit with family and friends. You will be charged an entrance fee (prices differ between local and foreign tourists). Bring drinking water so you don't get thirsty while walking around this place.","If you love forest, lush greenery, Balinese architecture, sculpture, and culture, this is a place for you. Oh, you must like monkeys as well! Because there are plenty of them and they roam free (even to the streets) and they are free to do what they like including giving you R-rated shows.

There are plenty of corners and areas to walk around, from crowded areas with tourist to secluded corners where you can find beautiful lush vegetations and sculptures that are decorated with moss. If you like carving, there are plenty of them, authentic and aged on the temple walls and surroundings. I spent half a day taking pictures of them but if you really want the details, that doesn't seem enough.

The monkey are well-fed and healthy, and please be mindful not to bring any food or loose items with you. Be respectful as the monkeys don't like to be disturbed, just like any animal. Pictures are fine but hold on to your phone tightly. Weather can be humid like most places in Indonesia but there are nice breeze and shades from trees that probably have exists since before Betty White was born.

Now there are many parking space so it's more convenient if you travel by car or motorcycle.","I was a little nervous at first but it was a fun experience. It’s very cool to see the monkeys running around, climbing, and eating. The baby monkeys are especially adorable. As long as you follow the rules you should be fine! Some of them were a little mischievous where as others were very chill resting.","A bit scary, as some of the monkeys can be aggressive, but most are just minding their own business and eating. Follow the rules posted such as not looking them in the eyes, securing all loose items, don't wear jewelry or other accessories. We saw a visitor whose long skirt was pulled on, another whose sunglasses were snatched away by a monkey, and a monkey sitting on a visitor's head trying to grab at her necklace (both of her pearl earrings were snatched by the monkey and eaten). But other than that, it was good experience and a little bit of a hike around the area."

I booked a solo trip and got a 10 pass card so that I could choose between the lessons on my own. Everything was perfect, rooms, food, service and the quality of lessons. You should see the studios.. the location is perfect as well, right in the middle of Ubud so you can walk everywhere. The whole facility is like a paradise. It is a commercial
place, but still you can enjoy the stillness in it. Also the spa center is a must try. I’ll defo come back.","Hey fellow yogis, back at the Yoga Barn in Ubud for round two, and let me tell you, it just keeps getting better! 🌟 Returning to this sanctuary of serenity feels like coming home – the familiar sights, sounds, and smells instantly wrap you in a warm embrace, welcoming you back with open arms.

This time around, I dove even deeper into my practice, exploring new classes and techniques that challenged both my body and mind in the best way possible. The variety of offerings here is seriously impressive, and I loved mixing it up with everything from invigorating Vinyasa flows to deeply restorative Yin sessions.

One thing that never fails to amaze me is the incredible sense of community that permeates every corner of the Yoga Barn. Whether you’re striking up a conversation with a fellow yogi in the cafe or sharing a laugh with your instructor after class, there’s a palpable sense of connection and camaraderie that just fills your heart with joy. 🌿💕

And let’s not forget about the food – oh my goodness, the food! Fueling up with a big coconut water from the on-site cafe after class has become somewhat of a ritual for me, and let me tell you, it hits the spot every single time. 🥥💦

Returning to the Yoga Barn feels like pressing the reset button for my soul – a chance to disconnect from the chaos of daily life and reconnect with what truly matters. Whether it’s your first visit or your twentieth, this place has a way of leaving you feeling rejuvenated, inspired, and utterly blissed out. Can’t wait to see what new adventures await on my next visit!","This place is the temple of yoga. The studios are wonderful. I booked a three class pass and enjoyed it very much. Lots of variety of styles, classes and schedules. I think it is a dream yoga studio model. A place not to be missed if you are a practitioner.
The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because when it comes to book the pass and asking questions about the process of booking the classes, the customer service can be improved, since it is a place with a lot of people, I felt that they rush instead of taking the necessary time with the customer as things could be explain with more detail.","The best staff ever!!!! They’re so friendly and it’s the best service- you can text them almost 24/7 and they’ll stand in front of your door in 1 min. Also the beds are super comfortable and they clean the room every day. I had the best stay at Yoga Barn, thanks so much 🙏🏼🙏🏼","I’ve loved coming to yoga barn for years and didn’t know I could love it even more until after I took a 150hr meditation teacher training with Leah & Paul. What they offer can’t just be described as a Meditation Teacher Training. Yes, you absolutely receive the knowledge and tools to become a great meditation teacher and meditator. But you are also taken on a transformational journey within yourself. For me, this was an unexpected bonus and such a necessary step in my evolution. Leah and Paul (+ all of the co-instructors) have sooooo much to offer and really give you their all. It is obvious how much thought and love has gone into designing the whole thing. Endlessly grateful!!"

the food was good too. my favourites were the crispy duck and the red velvet burger! the ox tail fried rice didn’t make it into my favourites, but it was still very nice!","If you come during lunch or dinner this place is BUSY but worth the wait.  If you can sit outside on the patio and enjoy the views of the green fields.  The service is efficient and friendly.  I like the system where you push a button for service or for the bill instead of waving a waiter down.  The atmosphere is modern Balinese and very lively. The food is DELICIOUS!  There were so many items I wanted to order because it looks so good. I ended up ordering the seared tuna salad, and the curry fish. Both were super fresh and incredibly tasty. Started running like a monsoon while I was eating outside but it was nice and refreshing added to the mood.","Hands down one of the best meals we had in Bali. The service was pretty good as well and for the ambience and surrounding the price points are great.

The bacon quiche was one of the best I've ever had. As was the prawn spaghetti with like a chilli crab sauce. The salmon nachos were a hit as well as the prawn curry and chicken pesto salad. The only thing avoidable was the mee goreng. The profiteroles were also great! The espresso martini was also v. Nice.

Must go place, has a huge waiting so expect that.","A very decent place. The meals are very good and very tasty. The best Tom yam I have ever had.
The was steak was also very good. And omg the fries 🤤 , it’s heaven. I am going to miss this place. You should definitely visit when you are in Ubud .

I ordered the Tom Yum Soup, fresh rolls, and a green juice.
Tom Yum Soup was super flavorful - perfect during a rainy day

Fresh rolls were fresh and well balanced! The peanut sauce was yummy as well.

Green juice was fresh pressed and delightful! Not too sweet.","My dining experience at Seed Eatery in Ubud was absolutely delightful! The Thai cuisine served here was both delicious and authentic, satisfying my cravings perfectly. What's more, I was pleasantly surprised to find no waiting list upon arrival, allowing me to indulge in the scrumptious dishes without delay. The ample parking area was an added bonus, making it hassle-free to access. Whether you're a fan of Thai food or simply seeking a tasty meal in Ubud, Seed Eatery is definitely worth a visit!","We liked this place a lot! We had the spicy shrimp salad and the shrimp sashimi. We thought that would be enough as they’re listed as main dishes but we fell a bit short and had to order the additional rice paper rolls dish.
Overall very tasty, really nice dishes, but to me in the smaller side!","best restaurant in ubud by far.
i don't think i can point out which food is not delicious. for its price point, it's definitely worth it. and the food came pretty quick.

If you go here at weekends or high season (holidays), you must come here ±1 hour before its opening time to get seated first. or else you'll wait ±1-1,5 hrs to get seated.","This pad Thai was kinda life changing! I’ve never it prepared this way in that the egg was kinda wrapped around the noodles, creating a crusted bowl. A plus for creativity and for pulling it off. I also ordered the cendol dessert which was delightful. Comes with a coconut type ice cream flaked with peanuts."

The decor and the atmosphere transport you to a fairy tale world. The staff are so friendly and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the ingredients in our food.
We decided to do the “Food chooses you” experience in which you draw three fortune cards and this decides your menu. I’m so glad I did this because I got items that I wouldn’t usually get- all of which were delicious. The Tuna Tartar was so soft and creamy. The steak was tender and cooked to perfection- the mash was a great complement to the dish also. We got some cocktails and I once again had fate decide my drink- the cocktail maker made a delicious whisky based cocktail that he brought over to me himself. He told us it was a cocktail he was going to enter into a competition- if so he is sure to win!!! Definitely one of the best (if not the best) restaurant in Bali. Recommend this to any traveller, foodie or adventurous person who passes through Ubud. Please give the “food chooses you” a go… you won’t regret it!",Definitely a unique experience. Especially choosing the cards for your dinner. You don't have to do that but it was fun letting the cards pick your dinner. Nice atmosphere Great place to hang out. They have a wide variety of drinks to choose from as well. I would recommend this place anyone to have a good evening at. Or to even just go during the day for lunch. The staff was very accommodating and polite. Wasn't a long wait to get seated as well,"Amazing upscale restaurant located in the heart of downtown. Reservations required in advance. This magic themed place gives you the opportunity to pick a card to choose your 3 course meal, or you have the option of choosing your own dish. The service was spectacular and the food was cooked to perfection. I chose the mushroom steak and it was absolutely incredible! The decor inside is breathtaking with a painted glass ceiling, glass spiral staircase, and a grand piano. The tables were decorated with fresh floral arrangements. Everything about this place was magnificent. Would absolutely recommend this place and will be visiting again.","Merlin's place is truly magical. I was amazed to find that it's even more enchanting in real life than in the pictures. I had the wonderful opportunity to play the piano there, and I'm grateful to the staff for allowing me to do so. They were incredibly kind and even enjoyed my playing!
Additionally, the food is amazing; every dish is presented in an incredible way that adds to the overall experience.","I recently celebrated my birthday at Merlin's in Ubud and had a truly unique and enjoyable experience. The whimsical, enchanted atmosphere of the restaurant immediately transported us into a world of magic and wonder—think Hogwarts meets fairy forest. The witchy, earthy vibes were complemented by delightful details like magic-inspired menus and a warm, inviting ambiance that made us earth signs feel right at home.

The restaurant offers a fun twist on ordering—a tarot card reading to determine your appetizer, main meal, and dessert. Though not traditional tarot, the messages we received were surprisingly resonant and added a touch of the spiritual realm to our dining experience.

We opted to order from the menu instead of the card pull and were not disappointed. The food was delicious, and the staff even surprised me with a complimentary birthday dessert, which was delectable. We did try some other desserts as well, but unfortunately, the bread pudding didn't quite hit the mark for us. Along with my birthday dessert they brought me a thoughtful little gift and I truly felt special.

Overall, Merlin's offers a creative and memorable dining experience with tasty food, attentive service, and an atmosphere that's simply bewitching. I'd recommend it for anyone looking for something a little different in Ubud—the enchanting environment and curated boutique shop alone makes it worth a visit."

The hotel was very lovely, our room was very big and to a great standard. The swimming pools were great and nice to have access to a bar nearby. We took part in one of the complimentary activities of Yoga and it was really great! They had lots available and running if people were interested. Food was also good - we stayed as half board and my only note is it would be nice to have more option at dinner time. The menu is set each night and you only have a choice between 2 mains, would have been helpful to know before we booked but the food was still all very nice. The staff couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful throughout our stay.
Location was great, very central in Ubud and plenty to see by walking distance.","Stayed 2 nights with my best friend and our moms. Took me by surprise how spacious each room was and a big bath and open shower. Service was great and their breakfast buffet was so tasty, fresh, and friendly. The latte made that morning was one of the best i have tasted. Compliments to the all kitchen management team. The pool was cozy and had decent shade.

The room's are so clean and aesthetic, the staff is so kind and nice, they always have a smile on their faces. The food and options are amazing. I loved how down to earth the staff's are they're just so amazing and dedicated in their work. I loved every single thing about this beautiful resort pls experience this.","The staff was exceptional. It was a pleasure interacting with everyone. The bed was great and very large, room was clean. I can't too much blame the hotel for the scent that sometimes came from the water closet, as that is likely due to the nature of how the island manages this area. A little Lysol spray on few occasions was needed. Nothing that affected my stay as I would return here in future.

The location was great, really central. Overall, it was a great stay.","Alaya is soothing.
Alaya is situated at the heart of Ubud on a busy street surrounded by super Mart and lots of restaurants. It is walking distance from the famous monkey temple of Ubud.
The resort starts with with reception and a parallel in house restaurant. The check-in was smooth and I followed the concierge to our room at the very end of the hotel. The room spacious with an open washroom. The highlight was the balcony of our room overlooking one of two pools of the hotel. The hotel is connected to other 3 restaurants as well which you can access from inside the hotel itself.
They have a good variety of food in buffet breakfast. You can also order from a-la-carte menu for breakfast(complimentary). The staffs are welcoming and helpful.
I had pleasant stay here. I will consider coming back."

They provide a valet parking service since it's quite difficult to find a parking space in the area, which makes it more convenient to dine in.","To be frank, as someone who has experienced pizza well in Italy, I have not seen a taste as good as it is exaggerated. I think the pizza was very thin and the ingredients were few. I think there are places in Ubud that make it much better. Pasta and risotto were nice. The environment and ambience is sweet, I think it is a bit of a touristic place, unfortunately there is no air conditioning, but you can go and have a sweet dinner.","Yes you should make a reservation if you can‘t wait.

We started with a coffee each, I ordered a piccolo and my partner ordered a flat white, both with oat milk. They were made well and the texture was good, resulting in an enjoyable coffee, but for me the coffee itself was a bit basic in taste. I prefer light roast as there is more going on in the cup. So having the choice of beans would be a huge plus to this place. Latte art could've been a bit better but that's me being picky too. We then had some lunch, I had shakshuka and my partner had a humus and veg sandwich (can't recall the name) and they were both really good! Lots of flavor. We then ordered a cake each, one chocolate and one carrot cake. Both were fantastic and the chocolate cake was huge! Throughout our time there, we spoke with numerous different members of staff and they were all incredibly friendly and happy, so 10/10 for customer service.

The staff were friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was very nice!
I would recommend to ask to sit on the second floor (in the terrace because is a lot nicer.",I took back one star because they brought my starter and main course almost same time ( just 2 -3 mins apart) so it quite made me feel like I have to stuff food myself as I don’t want it to be cold.

The vegetables were very nice, but I found the satays and duck to be nothing too great. Their signature crispy duck is good for most, but you might prefer the smoked one if you like sauce with your meal.

They have non spicy options, and even the slightly spicy ones are really not that spicy (this is coming from a Singaporean who can hardly take spice).","This restaurant looks more like a resort & is huge. Staff are very friendly and speak good English. Although their specialty is duck, they serve various other type of meat. Place is very tastefully set up and a great place to take some nice photos. Food is considered ok and price is reasonable. Give it a try if you are in Ubud, Bali.","This restaurant is big. I appreciate that when we arrived it was empty and they took us to the back of the restaurant and a big table where we can have nice view seeing the rice field, and placed mosquito repellent incense as it was getting dark.
The duck is absolutely delicious. We first ordered half duck to share but it was a really lean and didn’t have much meat. We ordered the 2nd half duck and it was a lot more meaty than the 1st half. It would be great if our 1st half was the same portion.
Overall it is a great place to try the duck. I really liked it.","Come here for the second time. I ordered an original crispy duck set, and the other three guests decided to try something different and order a whole duck with sambal sauce set meal. I like the original version very much, but the rest of the guests didn't really like the non-crispy version. The restaurant setting is beautiful, and sit next to a paddy field with gardens around the dining area.

Reception staff is trained to annoy customers, like they were offering two separate beds instead of king or queen size to honeymoon couples, even after long arguments she provided, but it was annoying.","Located in the heart of Ubud, its a walking distance from Monkey forest and has many attractions nearby. Rooms were a bit small with no closed cupboards. Bathroom was very small and had lots of ants so the hotel would do good with pest control. Staff was very polite and friendly. Breakfast was good. They helped us book a tour but i would suggest not taking from them as they are pricey. Airport pick up and drop is also pricey.","The Pros: The views from the room are awesome, the staff is friendly and allowed us to store our suitcases before and after checkout so we could comfortably explore the area without lugging our bags around. The pool is well maintained and a fun place to relax in the water and enjoy panoramic views. The bed was comfortable, the AC worked well, and there was no mold in our room.

Cons: many, many ants in the room. Probably at least a hundred. We didn't notify the staff because we were only staying a night, however I think the comfort of guests could be improved with some pest control.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel for those on a budget who don''t mind a few ants. For a couple nights, you won't have any problem. Thanks again to the awesome staff!","Perfect location, walking distance to the Monkey Forrest park. 10 mins distance drive to Ubud Palace and market. However, I can hear people talking from the neighbour room and people talks when they walk pass. The breakfast is higher than what I expected. The hair dryer provided by the hotel is really not powerful.","The hotel is very fantastic.. all places are near by
It's in central part of Ubud so no need to spend much amount of money to go to some of the attraction places.
Rooms are also very clean and they provided very good room service..
Food rates are also reasonable and breakfast was really awesome.
Special thanks to erry for the hospitality."

The quality of the meat is outstanding, with each cut being tender and flavorful. The fries are crispy and perfectly complement the main course. One of the highlights is the presentation of the available meat cuts on a meat platter, allowing guests to see and choose their preferred cuts. Additionally, the steak is cooked to each guest's taste right at the table on a charcoal grill, adding a unique and delightful touch to the meal. Overall, it’s a highly recommended spot for steak lovers.","This is one of those restaurants I’d be happy to go back and recommend.
Simple, unpretentious, really good meats and the owner was there supervising everyone and ensuring quality service.

The ambiance was warm and cozy. It looked small but the restaurant goes all the way back.

If you are carnivore, you find home. Quality meats cooked to your order of doneness. It comes out perfect every time.","It’s been a week since I came to this place and it still pops in my mind when I find myself looking for a restaurant. I’d love to live next to it!
The quality of the meat is outstanding. We didn’t have the most expensive cuts and they still melted like butter. I didn’t even need to chew them frantically like it happens sometimes. They brought it over to us just sealed on the grill and pulled a table next to us so we could see how they finished it depending on how done we wanted it. We both asked for rare and they even went beyond to cut it and plate it for us right there.
We had the grilled octopus to start and it was so soft, so pleasing. And then accompanied the meat with fries and asparagus.
The owners are from Spain and Argentina - they knew what they were doing 😉
100% recommending this place!","One of the best experiences we had in Ubud was at this place. The staff were knowledgeable, the fish was fresh, and the steaks were excellent. Unfortunately, we missed out on trying the octopus because it was sold out, but the croquettes were absolutely delicious.","The meat cooked and tasted really good but i think overpriced. The side dish was not that much and a lil bit overpriced compare for what u’ve got.
The drinks that we got is not that strong. Especially the Aperol Spritz, too much sparkling water maybe than the Aperol itself. The food costs more than 2mil rupiah. 😅"

i loved the chill but social atmosphere & the staff is very very sweet. breakfast is awesome every morning & i loved the free morning yoga + massages.

i would recommend this to any solo backpacker who wants a little bit more of luxury. it’s definitely worth the money.","I really liked my stay here at puri garden. The rooms are lovely with big double beds, nice en-suites, the shower has great pressure and their lemongrass shampoo, conditioner and gel smells amazing! The staff are lovely and friendly, always greeting you with a smile, even the cleaner is the sweetest!! They host great trips and events everyday. The cafe restaurant attached is lovely with free breakfast for guests. The pool is great too. I would only like to control the AC in the room ourselves as housekeeping controlling it was a bit inconvenient. Other than that- a top stay!","This place really is as good as advertised. ALL of the staff are quite literally the most friendly, welcoming and hospitable people I have come across in 6 months of travel. They go out of their way to make you feel at home and comfortable. The beds are big and comfortable and the rooms are nice. If you stay in a mixed dorm you will have to walk to the shared bathroom, but its only annoying at night. The food at the attached restaurant is fantastic and they have included breakfast that was just perfect for me. The free daily massages were so nice and a great way to start the day. They run activities daily and I had a great time at trivia both nights. They can also organize sun rise hikes and daily activities.

Because of the setting, this place does unfortunately attract some young pretentious people that come in groups and tend to not be very friendly. I met a few solo travelers that ended up becoming great friends, but be aware of the younger crowd that tend to stick to their crowd and take pictures by the pool all day. I found myself hanging out with and chatting with the staff way more than most of the guests. The free yoga classes are not very good unfortunately and I only found it necessary to go for one. For solo travelers, might be best to try it out for a few nights and then decide if you want to stay longer. Can always go back to chill and not actually stay there.","Really liked my stay at Puri Garden Hostel !
The staff was amazing, welcoming, super helpful and smiling. ☺️
-(Not the hostel responsibility) but some others guests in the worst case scenario..won’t have any shame having sex in the same room as you. 🙄
- Bathroom is also a bit disturbing as the doors for shower and toilets are blurred windows.
-Key locker for me was broken so I couldn’t store my stuff properly.

Besides that I consider this place to be a luxurious hostel, super nice and quiet. Very relaxing with great activities everyday. Everything is made to be convenient🙌🏽 Also the mixed dorm room was great, super clean!","Absolutely love this hostel! Best hostel we’ve stayed at during our 6 month south east Asia trip.

The pork ribs is a little bit dry for my taste, mushroom tempura okay but nothing special. Portion is generous though 👍

The waitress is very kind and polite, so the service is amazing.

The cafe is nice with some chairs looking out to the window and the street.","We were interested in trying pork ribs in Ubud so we had lunch at Warung Pondok Madu on a Monday at around 11 am. The restaurant wasn't busy so we were seated immediately (indoor seating only). We ordered the mushroom tempura, pork rib combination, tumis kangkung (sauteed green water spinach), and sayur hijau. I think we were too early for lunch because the kitchen wasn't ready to make the pork ribs combination for us since it required them to cut ribs off a large rack. However, they were able to accommodate and fulfill our order. The pork combination comes with 10 different ribs to try which was fun to share. The ribs were on the smaller side and they were good, but nothing earth shattering. We enjoyed all the sides we ordered. Overall, the meal was good and the staff were very friendly and nice. They also accept credit card. The restaurant has a very large menu so the other items may be great, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try the ribs.","Too sweet, too salty, nothing extraordinary. However, I thank the staff members and the inside venue with A/C on (it was still warm, yet better than I expected based on reviews).

I ordered 1 nasi goreng & bbq + spring roll. I wanted to order mango mint iced tea. All mango related drinks were sold out. I ended up drinking strawberry lime iced tea. It was yum! 😊

Tips

-Give yourself 30-40 minutes for food to come.

- Order 1 menu then add on. For me, ordering 1 nasi goreng + 1 spring roll menu was too full.

- Surprisingly I liked the spring rolls and iced tea more than bbq.","We walked up the street to a Warung we had tried before and liked, but it was full, so we came back and ate at Warung Pondok Madu. This was a bit of good luck because our meal at Warung Pondok Madu was one of the best we had in Bali. It was not the cheapest (ordering beers bumped the price up as did the tax and service charge) but the nasi goreng I had with my ribs was the best I have ever had. Really, it was; I would go back just for the nasi goreng.

My wife had her ribs with mie goreng and we both shared a bowl of Tom Yum soup, which was faithful to the Thai taste. The online menu system via your mobile was a bit annoying but staff were prompt and attentive; it  can get a bit warm inside though, the aircon is not as good as a lot of other places, but we would still go back again.","Food was good !
Pork rib was so delicious. Loved it
But it's extremely hot inside of restaurant. Also the staff... if you asked once or twice about food it's okay. Not every 5 mins keep coming back  asking that's a bit disturbing feel awkward.
Being too hot and keep being asked. It's a bit annoying."

The service and vibe were unreal, creating an atmosphere that was both relaxing and invigorating. The cafe features a pool in the back, with an abundance of plants around the cafe, which makes for a refreshing and serene environment.

They had exceptional customer service! We overlooked the bacon on the eggs Benedict, and the staff made no issue about remaking the dish. The manager on duty was so hospitable, the entire staff had eager attitudes that made our experience even better.

Now, let's talk about the food. I no lie had the best iced coffee I've ever had; there was absolutely no need for the simple syrup they kindly provided. The salmon poke bowl was another standout, featuring a really tasty sauce. Everything was  healthy with such fresh ingredients. The fruit bowl was incredible, and the pancakes with cream were the perfect dessert to top off our meal.

We were surprised by how affordable the bill was for all that we ordered. To top it off, the manager even gave my husband and I complimentary espressos and cookies. Ivy Cafe quickly became one of our favorite places in all of Ubud. Absolutely incredible time – highly recommend!","I love the food here! The pizza from their wood-fired oven is delicious and maybe some of the best pizza in Ubud! It’s that good! Their avocado toast is a must with the delicious pesto they add to it! And the smoothies are delicious, especially the Ivy and the supercharged! As are smoothie bowls! Highly recommend! Staff are extremely kind, like I’m blown away by how lovely all the staff are.","Food to try - New Orleans Fried Chicken
The batter was well coated, flavourful and light. Easily the best dish I had in this cafe. Chicken was juicy and not dry which was a bonus.

Service provided by the staffs were excellent. They were attentive and friendly. Perfect example of the amazing Bali hospitality.

Atmosphere - Cafe was modern, contemporary and well maintained. Aircon is a bonus in the sweltering heat.",Amazing restaurant and really attentive staff. The food was so fresh and delicious and there was such a huge variety of choice. One waitress even brought my friend over a plaster when she noticed she needed one without her having to ask!

It’s hard to sit by the pool as they don’t have umbrellas.(a suggestion to the  hotel) one of the staff ripped us off in money thinking we didn’t know what we were doing","It's a cool and sweet little hotel with a soul and great (small, though) rooftop pool. However, don't get too excited about the food. Breakfast is so poor we were eating outside almost each morning.","I planned to stay for one night, but I prolonged it for five nights. The room was clean and cosy. Quiet enough even though the outside road was busy.

The improvement that needs to be done is in the restaurant during breakfast time. There were only two staff members who helped the guests. However, most foods were finished and it still took some time to bring them out from the kitchen. There was not enough attention given in this department.

Overall, it was a good experience."

It's rated as 4 Star establishment, but it's definitly on par with hotels that earn 5 Stars.

We booked the Deluxe Room with the Plunge Pool and it exceeded our expectations.  The room was very clean and extremely comfortable, and the floating breakfast we enjoyed on Valentine's Day was simply amazing.  Speaking of food, the hotel restaurant   never disappointed.  The food was fresh and prepared exquisitely.  The hotel and restaurant staff were very friendly and attentive.

The hotel offers spa services and a variety of purchasable activities/services at reasonable rates and we highly recommend all of it.

The hotel's location adjacent to the Sacred Monkey Forest is ideal.  Within a 15-20 minute walk, you will find other attractions in Ubud as well as countless shops and restaurants.

We can't say enough about our experience at Anumana, we absolutely loved it!  We will definitely stay there again when we are in the Ubud area.","Caution!

Chocolatatine didn't have much chocolate and it wasn't oozing (I cut it in half as soon as it was served to see two semi hard strips).

Cheese croissant was the second best recommendation which was tasty but very very greesy. It left our fingers oily and paper soaked.

Flat white was average and handicraft chai tea matcha was underwhelming. We were told it would have some nice spiced flavour which there was none.

Also you can take a walk inside of the resort which I really liked.
Actually I bought tickets online then when I get here I forgot that I already have the tickets so I bought it again. To not to be confused I recommend to buy tickets offline when you get here since it's not crowded.","Outstanding collection of Balinese artworks and such a calm oasis from the crazy streets outside.

I selfishly wished the environment in the galleries is more conducive for longer periods of appreciation and pondering as it was absolutely cooking inside.

Do not miss further exploration onwards to the rice terraces, water gardens and river beyond the gallery compound - just follow the direction signposts. Visit late afternoon when the temperatures are more humane and the light is softer and lower.

GORGEOUS room, extremely kind staff and the buffet breakfast was super delicious every single day!! 100% would recommend:)",This hotel has an very convenient location and it is very peaceful looking out on the rice paddy fields. They have amazing service and they always make sure that you get everything that you need. The rooms are very clean and welcoming. I loved it!,"We stayed at Plataran in Ubud for six nights and wanted to write a review that hopefully others find helpful:

Pros —
-Beautiful and really peaceful property in the heart of Ubud. The property is very quiet  in contrast to the chaos of Ubud while still being walkable to many of the things we wanted to do (1 minute walk to Suka + Yoga Barn)
-The staff are very friendly and hospitable
-We were traveling with our 2 year old son and the kids club was great for him to play at indoors to escape the heat

Cons —
-The free buffet had plenty of food, however we weren’t very impressed with it (for being a 5 star hotel). We ended up just getting fruit from the buffet, and would go to Suka for breakfast.
-The bed was super comfortable, but the pillows were not.
-Our air conditioner wasn’t working properly the first night of our stay and we barely slept. We asked for the night to be complimentary because of the inconvenience but they were unwillingly to do that and gave us ‘free massages’ instead. Not what we were looking for and what felt equitable considering the circumstances but we let it go.
-My wife booked the free massage but asked if she could do a facial instead. She had thought that she just had to pay the additional charge for the price difference of the facial vs massage. Turns out there was a miscommunication (language barrier) and we had to pay the full price of the facial. We attempted to have a conversation with the hotel manager (Helena) about the miscommunication and find a mutually agreeable conclusion but she immediately became agitated, condescending, and dismissive of our concerns. She was unwilling to accept any responsibility for the language barrier and miscommunication. Her aggression and lack of acknowledgment of our concerns was antithetical to Balinese hospitality. Plataran didn’t do anything to attempt to rectify the situation and make it right after that exchange.

Overall we had a great experience + enjoyed our stay at Plataran. However, our interaction with Helena was unacceptable + hope that future guests are not treated the way that we were.","Coming straight from staying in a Junior suite in Nandini Jungle by Hanging Gardens to Plataran Ubud's Deluxe Premier room (sharing with a 12 year old as the 3rd person), I initially did not feel the 'wow' from Plataran Ubud as the room felt very small in comparison and did not offer the standard mini bar luxuries I would expect from a 5 star hotel. However, I have to say I was totally won over by the end of our 4 night stay here by the incredible staff, and food, in particular the breakfast range was more than sufficient, the views from the restaurant, the expansive grounds that were impeccably maintained, the tranquility despite being on the doorstep of a lively area and of course the amazing Balinese cooking experience on site. The cooking experience was my top highlight, and chef Budi made it enjoyable. I learned a lot and noted all the herbs and spices used (that they grow on site, mind you!) resonated soundly with me as I am from the Caribbean. I even grew to appreciate us being amongst the landscape of the long drying stems of the surrounding the rice fields.
I would definitely stay here again, but maybe I would go for one of the Suites instead. That would give it the touch of luxury that I wanted."
