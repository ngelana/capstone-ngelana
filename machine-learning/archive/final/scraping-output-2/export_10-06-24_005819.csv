Kediri, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82121, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=3965702884959676139,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3963-8105,,lodging,4.7,75,,"Unfortunately, my experience at ""Los Hobos"" was disappointing. While the apartment is functional, it's evident that corners were cut on various aspects. Despite these compromises, the rental price is unreasonably high. Additionally, the initial friendliness of the owners quickly fades once you're settled in. There was a particularly frustrating incident when a friend of mine was locked out and instead of promptly assisting, the owner reacted unfriendly and directed her to call me for help. This lack of hospitality was disheartening. Overall, I cannot recommend ""Los Hobos"" as a place to stay. If you're planning a visit to Kedungu, I suggest exploring other accommodation options for a more welcoming experience.","This place is absolutely stunning.
Rice field, and ocean view, Gourgeous pool with an amazing view, Apartments are clean, high ceilings, modern and organically, decorated,  the owners are lovely, i can't say enough about this place, the location is perfect. One of my new favourite places in Bali.","+ Fantastic views of Bali from Los Hobos (ricefields, palmtrees, the ocean and the vulcano!)

- very LOUD traffic right in front of the hotel, expect many loudbikes‚Ä¶ The whole building is not soundproof now.

Would stay here for months if this sound problem would be solved. Now its overpriced :S","I recently had the pleasure of staying at an incredible place in the tropical paradise of Bali, Indonesia, and I simply cannot contain my excitement to share my experience with the world. From the moment I arrived until the moment I reluctantly checked out, every aspect of my stay was nothing short of perfection. This hidden gem deserves nothing less than a glowing 5-star review!

First and foremost, the location of this hotel is absolutely breathtaking. Nestled amidst lush greenery and overlooking rice patties, it offers a mesmerizing view that can only be described as pure serenity. The surrounding landscapes and soothing sounds of nature were the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable vacation.

Speaking of the accommodations, they were nothing short of luxurious. My room was a haven of tranquility, beautifully designed with elegant furnishings and modern amenities. The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep, and the private balcony offered a mesmerizing view that I'll forever cherish. The cleanliness and attention to detail were exceptional, creating a sanctuary that I was always eager to return to after a day of exploration.

Last but not least, the attention to detail and commitment to sustainable practices were evident throughout the property. The hotel's eco-friendly initiatives and dedication to preserving the natural beauty of Bali made me appreciate my stay even more. It's truly a place that values both its guests and the environment, which is a testament to their commitment to excellence.","One of the most beautiful views I have ever experienced. The room was huge lots of lights with a view of the ocean, rice field and the mountains very private, clean, comfortable and modern. I can sit outside of the balcony reading a book's while enjoying the incredible scenery."

Sunday dumpling 5k/pcs min 6pcs.
Mala noodle Recommend !
Best chili oil !","Foodgasm!

I came because of the reviews, of course‚Ä¶

My first experience wasn‚Äôt the best because I was really in a hurry and a minute is critical. I waited 30 minutes and my food wasn‚Äôt ready because apparently there were a big group that afternoon (it‚Äôs a lousy reason btw :)

I paid the bill, I asked for take away, but I still needed to wait. So I left without food. It‚Äôs sad because I was actually excited for the food. The place is nice, they gave complimentary starter which was very tasty, so I was craving for the noodle even tho I haven‚Äôt try it. But I left empty handed.

The next day I came back to collect my change, because I paid without looking for the bill and I know I gave them more (I was really in a hurry, sorry!). It‚Äôs not surprising to me and they did the right thing and a good job! They returned my full money. So I ordered the same with what I ordered the day before. And today I‚Äôm not in a hurry :)

The food came just in time, and it‚Äôs exploded in my mouth. So the rave reviews were on point! Good job whoever the owner is! (I didn‚Äôt get her name when she was there the first day).

I would come back whenever I‚Äôm in Kedungu.","Ordered delivery and arrived promptly, well wrapped and hot.
The food was incredibly yummy.

Really nice range of flavours and a good level of spice, warming not hot.

We recommend the beef noodle soup, the Japanese curry and the gyozas!

Highly recommend and I bet it‚Äôs even nicer to have in!"
