Overall a good stop if you are on your way to the north from Kuta or Seminyak and are keen to try a local warung experience.,"Overall its great experience. We could customize and chose the dishes per person. Has around 15 balinese dishes option. Price is worth it, around 40k per person including drinks","Nasi campur concept with so many food choise, nice... üëç","The place is big and clean, comfy to eat. I got recommendation from my colleague to try eating at Kedaton. My expectations were too high about this place. The taste of the food is okay, they sell varies of Balinese and indonesian ready‚Äîto- serve food, there are no any specific menu to recommend . They just okay, not that special. The price is moderate. But the staffs are not friendly, when serve us and interact with local visitors. They do not explain why we can not pay with card/ qris in good ways. Seems like they thought thatwe can not pay for  our food, we just prefer not pay by cash. When we ask about the nearest ATM, they just answered in short , ‚Äú just walk near gas station‚Äù. When We gonna pay at the cashier, we ask with smile how much we have to pay, then Ms. N***** (as written on her name tag) just stood in front of us  not answered anything and keep typing on her mobile phone for several seconds. We‚Äôre just confused why she didn‚Äôt answer anything. Then we asked again 2 times, hello Mbak, we‚Äôd like to pay our bills. Later on another staff aware with our existence in front of cashier keeping a wait, and she took over the machine and say sorry, we pay then go with bad experience.","Local cuisine, local taste of Bali. Quick service. Clean toilet. Has wide parking area. Recommend for your lunch."

Then there it is, I was right, it's a coffee shop with the same name with mine.

Then after we moved from Lovina to West Denpasar my wife decide it that we need to visit this place since it's close from where we're staying, so there we are. Turn out that they serve good food with delicious taste.

We ordered several dishes, some of their main menu and some of their snack, all of them are good, can't remember what we're ordering except one snack, their Tahu Gejrot (tofu in sweet and spicy sauce) was tasty, just like the authentic tahu gejrot from the street.

They have some good pastries like pate choux, croissant (plain butter, choco, or almond), eclair,  cinnamon rolls, cake rolls, crep√© cake, korean garlic cheese bread, range from 15k-30k per slice/item. And they have variety of savoury foods like American  breakfast menu item, British breakfast menu, pasta, pizza, and authentic Indonesian-Chinese food as well. Range from 30k-50k as well. They also have complementary foods like fruit platter, french fries or garlic bread sliced.
As for the atmosphere, quite comfortable with great lighting and on the first floor you can easily go to the counter and see pastries by yourself or you can sit outdoor on the second floor.
For drinks, they have some basic coffee menu and tea, also juice too.
The price was certainly middle range but the taste is quite decent üôÜ recommend for people who are looking for some place to be relax.","Good decorations and theme. Easy to find. Good parking area.
