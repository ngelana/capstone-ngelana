With 2 separate pools. The staff is very friendly and the food is also good. With a nice garden view and the sea I'm the distance. Entry tickets and food/drink prices are also low.
But in my opinion it is a place for locals with local standards..
I would easily have paid 15k to 30k more without a problem if the locker rooms/ showers were better. At least put normal doors for better privacy than those curtains that easily open due to the wind. Also separate area for women and men. And if the sitting areas where better,cleaner and more comfortable.

Ohh ya, just follow the alley to the end to get there.","Entrance tickets on weekdays: 10k

This place was such a delightful find. View of the ocean from the check in area, and beautiful area around the villa. The place felt safe with overnight staff and security, and the rooms were so nice. The linen deserves a special mention - great pillows and quilts, the best I've ever experienced in Bali!
The staff were lovely and accommodating. Breakfast was included and was delivered to the villa at the requested time. We were in the area for a wedding so didn't look around too much, but the location was great, easy to find and great quality. Thanks for a great stay!","In 2019 I booked an agent with them for my wedding party. Then Covid happened and we had of course couldn‚Äôt have it due to government regulations. I attempted to get my deposit back from them but they repeatedly declined (even though there was no mention of a ‚Äúno refund‚Äù policy)
Now fast forward and I‚Äôm trying to use this deposit to stay at their property so it‚Äôs not a complete loss. And now they say the deposit is no longer valid.

I would advise against staying at any of their properties and you can get a much better deal staying nearby at other locations","This. Is. Paradise. We LOVED this villa. The rooms were luxurious, the view and the pool and living area... perfection. Huge 5 bedroom with 3 facing the beach. Note you can't really get into the ocean water but the private little beach setup was lovely.","They don‚Äôt clean the beach at all, it‚Äôs very dirty","Happy Bali Wedding was arrange an intimate wedding ceremony Dec 2021 at this beautiful 5 bedrooms pool villa. An open living, kitchen and dining area overlooking to the garden and beach. The villa manager and team was friendly and help us set up and arrange beautiful ceremony at front of the beach. It is nice villa for wedding ceremony at your pocket budget. They have some new rooms build in Balinese cottages right next door to accommodate your friends and families.

The host's welcome game was on point, making our stay extra special.

The place is perfect vibes for a tropical getaway.

Highly recommend this spot for a chill and fabulous Bali experience! üëç","I am part of the family group who were robbed overnight. We had 2 young children with us. The police have CCTV of 3 people wearing helmets and masks entering the property and going into the bedroom where my grandson was sleeping and switching off the CCTV. They spent some time searching my bedroom while I was asleep, going through several cases and bags which must have taken some time. I can't even think about what might have happened had I or my grandson woken up while they were in the room. The house is insecure and I couldn't recommend it on that basis alone as the area is quite remote, but the property is also tired and not very clean. There is no proper kitchen to prepare food or drinks and no inside living area.
The police are taking the home invasion very seriously and keeping us updated, but I am horrified that the owner thinks it is acceptable to try to blame a family group for faking the robbery just to avoid refunding us .Very worrying, so please do not choose this property and stay safe.","WARNING Do not stay at this place they have no security and rob you whilst you sleep.
The staff must have been involved as the CCTV cameras were turned off during the robbery then back on again when they left!
The host is now refusing a refund when there is no way we could stay in the house when they robbed us.
DO NOT STAY THERE!","Stayed here for a couple days and we loved it. Beautiful location, quite, and staff is very caring about its guest. If you are looking for a group Airbnb or hotel this is the spot. If we come back to Bali this will be our go to spot üëåüèª","Excellent service, recommended place to spend family vacation.

Phoenix, Pak Wayan and the whole team were just phenomenal and offered an amazing level of service I've never experienced at a villa before. We also had them cater a big lunch for 20 people and it was incredible- stunning Balinese feast. I can't wait to come back!! Thank you to everyone at caSabama for the best birthday stay! :-)","The photos of the villas do not do them justice ‚Äî spacious, gorgeous, well-established gardens. We booked all three villas for a 40th gathering and each has their own personality, but work perfectly for a gathering of 20 people ‚Äî you can all gather in one or there are plenty of hideaways for some quiet time.

Phoenix, Wayan and their team managing the villas went bobs and beyond organising the birthday lunch, looking after us every day. Extremely helpful whenever we needed, and I‚Äôm sure put up with a lot from us over our five days!

Every single one of the 19 people staying there have said we would go back. We were only half-joking as we went through who is 40 next in our group as we were leaving.

Thank you caSabama and the whole team!!","An ideal home away from home in Bali. Strikingly beautiful with quirky personal touches. Attentive staff who anticipated my needs.

Been here thrice and looking forward to my next visit.","The design of the Villa is top class, while the service is disappointing.
The receptionist was poor in English when we were trying to checkin. And there was no room number so we didn‚Äôt know who should stay in which room.
Our room service didn‚Äôt get towels replaced. What‚Äôs worse, we showered cold water for 2 days, because there was no hot water available.","Beautifullly designed, peaceful and relaxing. Staff were all top notch and lovely. Couldn't ask for more! Thanks for the special weekend Team caSabama!"

Loved our stay here. Clean, comfortable, cold AC, wifi, wonderful hosts.  The location is perfect if looking for a getaway from the touristy parts of Bali. 5 stars all the way.","Really great place with very friendly hosts who are PROFESSIONAL Airbnb hosts. They run it like a 5-star hotel with daily maid service, a spa, massage services, and even free laundry service. The house is small, but very well laid out, so there is plenty of room for a family. It is also very close to the more traditional side of Bali with lots of sightseeing to do. The hosts are also very fair and honest as something major broke during our stay that they could have easily lied and said it cost hundred of dollars to repair. Instead, they came back with a request for a fair $50 charge.

The driver for hire is reliable and a great deal too, especially given the more remote location of this house.

If there are a few downsides to rumah saba, I would say these are the biggest issues.

1. It is right next to a small cow field, so there are tons of flies.

2. The maids have a bad habit if leaving the doors wide open while cleaning, inviting in enough flies to replace all the ones you killed the previous day.

3. Make sure to have exact cash for the massage and watch the time carefully. I believe I was charged rp75k for a rp50k massage and only had a rp100k bill, so I feel I paid double. Still a great value, but turned me off a bit.

4. A few shirts got ruined in the laundry (something with blue dye bled all over them). Plus they wash them traditionally, so they will get stretched. And it can take a few days to dry.

5. It is far from Denpasar or Kuta (30 minutes to 1 hour). So plan accordingly.

But do not let the downsides scare you Ibu Putu and her husband run an amazing Airbnb.  And the peace and quiet this place offers is a rare thing in this area. So relaxing!","The best place for relaxation. Miss Ni luh Putu warmly welcomed us with the cold face towel and a refreshing welcoming drinks.
