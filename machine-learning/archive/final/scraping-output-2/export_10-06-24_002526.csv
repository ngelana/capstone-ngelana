ChIJv-NCtCEZ0i0RbIT8M3h1v3g,Air Terjun Muntig,-8.47508,115.29777519999998,"Banjar Pengembungan, Pejeng Kangin, Kec. Tampaksiring, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80552, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=8700802164231799916,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,3.3,6,,"Off the beaten track, Muntig waterfall is probably best visited only by intrepid adventurers that don't mind bush-whacking, slipping down steep muddy slopes, spiderweb dodging and canyon wading. You will likely be rewarded by having the place to yourself. In early 2024 the trail was completely overgrown and steps down had been washed away by la dslide but it was still possible, if difficult, to access. It's a relief to find a simple forest fall without the massive infrastructure and facilities (and ticket takers and touts) that the rest of Bali's beautiful waterfalls have fallen prey to in recent years.

Interestingly, if you access from the East, you pass by the waterfall origin (top of the cliff/canyon fall) on the trail down to the river. There are great trails in all directions from here, so enjoy!

Motorbike access ONLY. To access from the East of the river, drive up the single-track paddy road until you see the stone plaque. Be considerate - Pull your bike completely out of the way and do not lock the steering! Walk down the narrow stairs towards the river. Cross the little cement bridge and turn left/South to make your way along the riverside trail... When you come to the mini dam, look to the right/West and you will see the water disappearing under a massive natural cave and out of sight (top of the falls!). But continue to walk south and listen for the falls... You will need to take a route down to the right to get to the river and then Wade through the canyon back yprivery toward the falls! Congratulations! You've discovered a not-so-quiet, but private corner of paradise!",The waterfall is quite lacking light since the forest has overgrown it mostly. Its free so nice to visit. To find the place follow the road until you come near the location on the map. Park the scooter and walk down the small stairs towards the river. Cross the little bridge down at the creek and continue the stairway down. Then you will find it.,"A bit tricky to find, but we really enjoyed walking and looking for the waterfall, we saw it as a little adventure. Make sure you have Google maps on, and follow it all the way to the red Pin: You park your scooter where the road ends, then cross a small bamboo bridge and the river. Walk along beautiful rice fields until you find a small settlement on your right. Follow the jungle-like steps down, and cross the river, keep going straight, and you will find it! Not busy at all, we were the only people and could spend time taking in the beauty of nature.",when i went there there was no one and the place was still lush i was a little afraid to go there it was better to use a motorbike because there was no parking space and it was around the rice fields and the location of the maps was not quite right so i had to ask peoples,
