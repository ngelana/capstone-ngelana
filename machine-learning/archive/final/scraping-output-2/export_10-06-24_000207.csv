The pool area, garden and restaurant are very pleasant to spend time. The standard rooms are very basic maybe overpriced, I assume ocean view villas are better. The food was not great, but there are not too many options in the area. Also there’s absolutely nothing to do around except surfing.","Amazing venue right at the medewi Break in Front of the Resort. Wakeing Up to the Sound of the SEA this Resort chills you Out to the max. Large Pool, Garden and very clean and nice rooms (seaview Bungalow) very caring staff and reception! The Restaurant is also a small gemstone :) definatly coming Back with our kids","This hotel is just amazing. The staff was so friendly and wanted to help us with everything. They came right after we spoke. The food is delicios and you have such a nice view from the restaurant to the ocean. The surfspot, for everybody, is right infront of the hotel, be careful with the stones. If you are an surfer you definitly have to go there. Thanks for having us!","Stunning Place to stay! The location right in front of the surf spot can't be better. Super friendly staff, huge beautiful garden with great pool area. Modern, clean rooms and comfortable beds. Great value for money. We've loved every moment of our stay at Umadewi.","So sad we had to leave this place! We stayed at the hotel and it was amazing, great value for money!

The rooms are brand new and very comfy. It has a great pool and huge outdoor area to chill out and enjoy the views over the surf break.

The restaurant has a great atmosphere, unbeatable views and a wide selection of food and drinks fairly priced. We had breakfast included and it was delicious, besides you can enjoy it anytime from 7 am to 5pm which is amazing.

Cannot recommend it more!"

They make you feel very welcome.
Thanks for the great stay!","Absolutely amazing! The best accommodation we had in Bali. It looks even better in reality than in the picture. The staff was very friendly and made us feel at home.
We stayed in a wooden bungalow. It was beautifully decorated, with sea view, huge bed and well equipped (fridge, kettle, tea, lots of hangers and storage for clothes). Perfect location in front of the beach and surrounded by a garden. Would definitely go back.","We spent a few nights at Aga Living recently and really enjoyed our stay. It was clean, had a local feel and the staff were amazing. It was little touches like taking the breakfast tray from the room as soon as we had finished, and leaving fresh towels on our balcony in the late afternoon. We didn't expect that for somewhere less touristy.

The beach was a minute away and close to the few restaurants around. The mosque wasn't a big issue for us. We will be staying there again soon.","I’ve stayed at Agaliving twice, and each visit has been fantastic. The service is superb; they go out of their way to make you comfortable at all times. Plus, it is literally in front of the best surf break in the area, which is a huge bonus.

The only downside is the mosque next door which can wake you up early in the morning. Despite this, Agaliving will be my top choice for the service and the location.","I have spent 3 nights at agaliving and it was a great choice. My room (wooden house with sea view) was super cool, clean and had great AC. Only a little bit of  sea view though. No problem at all sknce there’s a gate heading straight to the beach, where all the fishing boats lie and the surfers are. Dawok and his team did everything to ensure I had a convenient stay and helped me out getting surf coaching, equipment and drivers!
You should know that there are mosques around there and you hear them in your room. I went there for surfing and had a really lovely stay! Thank you very much!
Next time when in Medewi I am going to come back :)"

Location is great, 90 seconds walk to the beach, an inn made by surfers for surfers. The swimming pool is a definite plus for the price. My room had a/c and a nice view, being on the top floor: rice fields to the left, palm trees and ocean in front. Bathroom was ok, king size bed ok. The big plus being the guests staying there, all cool people 🤙","Lovely little hotel with beautiful rooms and a little swimming pool overhung with flowering camboja trees. A review before mentioned mould but they seemed to have sorted that. There was plenty of hot water but if there was one downside the water flow was poor.

There is a great selection of surfboards to rent, everything from fish to a choice of longboards Staff were friendly, especially Rahim who was full of advice about surfing and proved a great surfing tutor for my daughter.","Medewi Beach Inn will forever be one of the most memorable and best places I've ever stayed at. It was a shame I had only stayed a couple nights.  The room was beautiful, I loved the bathroom design. Nice comfortable beds, working AC, super clean. The pool was right out our door, they had a nice lounge setup. The food was so delicious, prices were great and the service from the staff was Awesome. The owner Eddie was the nicest person I met on my trip, and it was a pleasure to meet him. The surf is sooo close, just a couple steps away. Thank you to Medewi Beach Inn, they had really made my trip one to remember. 💙🤙🏾",">>>⚠️FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES>>>>These rooms have a mould problem. On arrival to our room the staff were just leaving with cans of heavy duty chemical spray to mask the terrible smell of the mouldy room. You can’t see it but it’s not nice. Subsequently we couldn’t sleep, the chemicals felt like they were burning our eyes. Breathing was also terrible so we checked out the next morning. This is also in some of the other reviews.

>>>>>1 of the beds looked like it had been slept in and or poorly made ( this also mentioned in other reviews )

>>>>>No hot water, not that was a problem but the shower rose was blocked with calcium deposits so it looked like they just cut a hole in the centre to let the water through

>>>>Bathroom is a potential hazard. To get to the toilet you must walk through the wet shower area. Without the water draining in the middle of the night you need to walk through a wet shower floor area, which is very slippery. Why they didn’t put the shower at the end then the toilet i have no idea 🤷🏼‍♂️ this is poor and dangerous design

>>>>>Plug / power sockets in the rooms were loose and sparking ⚡️😵‍💫 when plugging in your phone (see photo)

>>>>>No plug in the sink it was broken and never been fixed for a long time but the looks of things

>>>>>Stairs and all floor surfaces were slippery and dangerous. Not recommended to bring mum and dad here.

>>>>>The experiences from our other friends were the same. Looked like they had been crying all night. But it was the chemicals from the spray to mask the mould

>>>>>Regarding a safe in the room there was not one on ours

>>>>>No light switch besides the beds, again no biggy but poor design

>>>>>Upsides>>>There are some great reviews for this place and I’m sure many people have had good experiences. Just these let downs could be avoided with preventative maintenance and proper cleaning protocols.

Hope they can improve their offering to avoid these sorts of reviews","We didn’t actually stay at the hotel but we ate there most days for lunch. The coffee is amazing, probably the best we’ve had in Bali, and the food and service is great. Eddie is so friendly and welcoming, and was very generous with us especially considering we weren’t actually staying there!"

The best dish i had was the bbq ikan, one of the freshest and tastiest fish ive had, and lobsters were amazing too at a very reasonable price. Even the simple dishes like mee goreng were very delicious as well. The homestay they run looked lovely as well!","We came 3 times, two breakfasts and one dinner. They never brought us the right order, either they made the wrong dish, or they didn't bring us any order. They take a long time even if the bar is completely empty. The food is nothing special, if the place did not have the location it has, it would not be frequented","We pre-ordered 1.5kg of lobster and 1kg of whole fish for our Christmas lunch. The incredible food, with condiments and sides was served very quickly. So, let them know you're coming if you want lobster. The lobster is cooked in garlic butter, and it was glorious. Everything was so fresh and tasty. I won't be able to stop thinking about this meal for a long time. It was incredible and
the position is right on the beach. I took a bottle of wine and they gave us glasses and ice. We also ordered Bintangs and other drinks, that they have. If you're in Medewi, or nearby, you must try this humble place. They have quite an extensive menu. See the photos taken 25 Dec 2022.","Delicious local lobster and gado dado -- really can't be beat!

He runs a spotless place with the best staff. They are all very kind and helpful. I’ve been in Bali for a month and this was by far the cleanest place I’ve stayed in. Good restaurants nearby. Walking distance to the point to surf. Agus thank you!!!","Quiet, clean and run by cool people who are there, quietly making things easy for the guests 24/7.

I booked 3 nights and stayed 4 in the end. It is perfectly set up for surfers with a hose, shower, board racks and proper wet area set up for quick gear up and wash off after a session.

It's 3 minutes walk from the paddle out spots and the owner will give you all the beta you need on the local spots.

I found that the room I stayed in had a little bit of a stuffy bathroom, could benefit from an exhaust fan :) But it's also the tropics. The place is always kept really clean, as soon as someone wet goes up the stairs someone will magically mop it dry, pretty amazing.","The hotel and service were amazing. They were very helpful with any requests. They were also very patient with me when my card had issues, they helped me with getting to an ATM multiple times. The breakfast is very good as well. From my room I could also see a part of the waves, helping me to see if I should go on any particular day.","This is the best place!  The best thing that could happen to me.  First: Agus (the owner) is the most welcoming and friendly person.  He can show you the spot and tell you everything about it and give a lesson in surfing.

We arrived a little too early and that was not problem at all.

The Bungalow was exactly like in the pictures. The design was awesome, it was very clean and everything w honestly just perfect. I think that it is the most beautiful place we have stayed i
Kadek arranged everything we needed (he even drove my boyfriend to the local pharmacy because we needed some medicine). Kadek was absolutely lovely and again, very easy to communicate with.

We ordered breakfast two times and that was also amazing. If you go to Batu Kayu, please order the breakfast, you won’t regret it, it’s delicious!

We really wanted to surf so Kadek kindly provided us with the contact details of a surf instructor. It was a really fun experience. The place is amazing for surfing and the overal vibe of the whole property is very chilled and laid back.

If you are planning to go to Bali, I strongly recommend staying here. If we visit Bali again, we will definitely be staying at Batu Kayu again!","Beautiful lodges with views directly to the surf spot. the owner kadeg was super friendly and helpful and the fish bbq is highly recommended.
definitely worth a visit.","A truly remarkable experience awaits you at Batu Kayu Surf Lodge!
