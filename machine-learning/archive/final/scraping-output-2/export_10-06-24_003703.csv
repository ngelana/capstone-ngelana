Although it's busy and free to enter, it's a unique opportunity to walk through the grounds and admire the intricate designs of the palace. The steps are a great spot for photos!

The palace is conveniently located next to the market and just a short walk from the hotel we stayed at, making it easy to access. Do keep in mind that it can get crowded, so be mindful of others around you, and take care when crossing the street as vehicles and scooters are common in the area.

One of the delightful surprises during our visit was seeing the cute dogs lounging around the palace grounds, simply enjoying the day. It added a charming touch to the experience.

Overall, I highly recommend stopping by Ubud Palace during your visit to Ubud. It's a great way to immerse yourself in Bali's culture and history while exploring the vibrant town.","This well-kept historical palace is in the middle of Ubud city and showcases traditional craftsmanship and carvings.

Its location next to the busy market makes it a popular place to visit, learn about traditional culture and heritage, and shop.",This is all Mystical Bali are all about. It's a beautiful Palace with amazing architecture and landscape. Some of the area are not able to visit here and i believe there's a valid reason for that.

Hence deducting a star.,"A very fun experience at Ubud, getting to walk around the Balinese Hindu temple with proper outfit. The entrance fee is 50K IDR, which is worth in my opinion. I had many fun memories with my partner here. I recommend visiting during the day when the weather is good and the sky is blue!","Great temple! For local tourist only pay 25K IDR and also got the traditional clothes (rent). So many spot to take a picture.
But unfortunately no parking area inside this temple, so you need an effort when parking your bike/car","There was quite shocking show in the night here. It must be traditional show. They were dancing and playing instruments for an hour. But I didn't understand what I watched. While they were showing, many of audience were sleeping or left before ending of the show.
There would be cultural defferences what they want to show and audience want to watch through it. But I suspect It seems meaning by itself.","I think it was worth the 50KIDR entrance fee that included the proper dress. However, warring extra clothing really made me hot!

their coconut ice cream is very creamy, and comes with various coconut toppings! (coconut sugar, coconut chips, coconut flesh) very tasty, but if you’re looking for something light and refreshing as it’s feels quite guilty! 😂","Very small ice cream shop. They only sell coconut processed things (ice cream, coconut flakes, toasted or roasted, etc). It’s genuinely good. Doesn’t taste artificial at all, quite refreshing for a busy & hot Ubud at noon.
The downside though, the place is super small & not air conditioned so it’s super hot for an ice cream place! Though it’s beautifully decorated.
Also when I visited, the staffs are nowhere near friendly. They don’t smile, don’t explain the menu when I asked the difference for each one, even a bit rude and the gesture clearly shows they want me to be quick and leave the place asap. I understand that there was a queue and the weather is super hot, but still, they can’t treat the customers like that.
Anyway, the ice cream was good enough to be missed.","I had a classic coconut ice cream. There were coconut crusts and palm sugar on top and they gave the crunchy texture which made the tea very cream more flavorful. I really like the milkiness of coconut ice cream. It was quick to melt since it was hot, so I had to finish it quickly which was a pity. They also sell the coconut crusts and other stuff, so I got one to bring home.","The most delicious all natural Coconut Ice Cream. This is a must try for all adults and kids who love ice cream! There is more than one location, this one was quite small. Eat outside and enjoy the people watching. Don't expect any other flavors they are strictly all coconut and only coconut.","A super cool coconut shop where all of the products are made of coconut, and they have a crazy variety of produce I wasn't even familiar with before!

Although their coconut ice cream inside a real half coconut is considered their signature dish, we found the coconut ice cream inside their homemade coconut wafer cone much more interesting and delicious!! If you have the opportunity try both, but if you need to choose one - go for the wafer cone!

Make sure to also try the crunchie cookie - so delicious and special.

We also took some roasted coconut chips & their signature coconut brittle back home with us, to have a sweet memory from Bali and from this amazing spot."

With an extensive menu that caters to a variety of tastes, each visit has been a delightful culinary adventure. The food is consistently delicious, and I've had the pleasure of trying several dishes, each one more impressive than the last. This place has quickly become my favorite spot in Ubud.

The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive, making every dining experience enjoyable and welcoming. Whether you're a first-time visitor or a regular, you're treated like family. The ambiance is also wonderful, perfectly capturing the vibrant yet relaxed spirit of Ubud.
Having dined here multiple times, I can confidently say that this restaurant never disappoints. If you're in Ubud, this is a must-visit spot for exceptional food and outstanding service.","Thoroughly enjoyed our lovely breakfast here. This cafe is bright, lively and clean. Staff are extremely friendly. We tried their ""The Madu"" as well as the B.L.A.T., both of which were delicious. The coffee was decent as well!","Very disappointed with the service and food I had today at this Australian owned cafe. I am appalled at the variety of disappointments I encountered.

1. The manager (with a white shirt) was so rude to me when I was ordering. I asked a simple question about the coffee alternatives and she was very dismissive. Meanwhile, her and her colleagues were laughing about customers it seemed and she proceeded to be on her phone for the rest of the time so I wasn’t sure why she was so dismissive.

2. They got my lunch order completely wrong delivering the incorrect salad and proceeded to say I had ordered the wrong salad when in actual fact the trainee had not reconfirmed what my order and I clearly pointed at the Harvest Bowl that I wanted. Another employee came over and reconfirmed my order of a Harvest Bowl after she said the other girl was a trainee but yet they still got it wrong and caused me to wait another 15 minutes for my meal.

3. They reused the chicken from the original salad so by the time the meal I ordered came, it was DRY and COLD. When you are paying 45,000 for extra protein, this should be of good quality and add to the meal rather than make me leave half of it because it is inedible.

4. There was a fire in the kitchen causing the whole venue to smell like smoke and become very hot. Since they don’t have adequate air conditioning either, this really affects the eating experience.

I live in Ubud and have visited many cafes both local and foreign owned. I’m not normally one to write a bad review but this was truly disappointing and the staff did little to treat me like a valued customer nor compensate for their errors. Considering the price of their meals, I expect better.",Food was so yummy! Great prices too. I can’t seem to find my photos but I went back two days in a row. Had the chorizo croquettes first day and next day had the breakfast burger. Highly recommend. And the staff were so lovely,"Excellent pizza and food.
Madu salad was generous.
The pizza small size was enough for 3 to share as a snack.
Expresso is good.
Gluten free options.
Burger was well cooked, really nice.
Located centrally closed to Ubud Palace."

Both times I opted for a pour over, with two different coffees each time. Both were good, each with distinctly different characteristics. The filter menu is quite big which is nice. The cakes were so so, but we had lunch here twice and it was really nice. My partner ordered a flat white one day and a piccolo the following, both with oat milk. There was no bean selection offered for espresso based drinks unfortunately. The coffee is presented well, but what's missing is a little bit of paper with some information about the coffee you're drinking (bean info etc), as the menu often disappears after your order. I like to enjoy my coffee and explore the flavours with a little bit of information to guide me along the way. But this is personal preference. The people working are all super friendly and always make sure you're happy, but from a coffee lovers standpoint, it'd be nice for them to talk with you a bit about the coffee. Overall, it's worth checking out and if I had more time, I'd return!","Breakfast options we had was so delicious and well-prepared. The way they serve coffee is quite elegant and considerate, they bring you a sample of grounded dry coffee of your choice to smell while you drink. They have many coffee selections from different parts of Indonesia so this cafe is a great place to try some and buy the package you like to take home, we did so. Brownie had a mousse-like finish, rich in chocolate. Cashew cookies were salty and yummy. Staff was incredibly friendly.","This place always feels like home, all the staffs are already being my friends. And lots of guests are becoming my friends. Tourists, locals are blending to enjoy  coffee. Always had good vibes here. Keep the good service :))","Very chilled outdoor / indoor coffee shop. Cool vibes and comfortable seating! Great for digital nomads as there are plenty of different seating arrangements: regular tables, outdoor and indoor bar, communal table. WIFI works well too - finally!

Coffee is pretty good although I wasn’t too impressed with the flat white we ordered: too milky and large.

They have coffee workshops and training - bonus!","We enjoyed this place so much that we came back 3 times, and every single time we couldn't help ourselves and bought their amazing coffee and special products in the store across the street.

On our first visit we came just for drinks and a snack - the affogato 5 elements was so special, and the ice stress less cold brew tea was super refreshing. We also took the kouign amann which was delicious.

On our second visit we came for breakfast which is very recommended - we ordered the avocado on toast and the granola & yogurt - both were perfect.

On the third and last visit, we tried their matcha which was a bit grainy and too bitter to my taste, but the congo (chilled espresso with mango juice) was so special and refreshing.
This time we were lucky enough to have the rum & vanilla canelle which was sooo good, same for the egg tart which was delicious and rich in flavor."

The coffee drink taste is consistent with what they served in my country.

The problem with this place is their toilet being not available. After filling your bladder with their coffee, finding a working toilet is going to be a problem.

Another concern is that before entrance is a smoking area for starbucks customers. Expect to get 2nd hand smoke before getting inside.","Starbucks always a good place to have good coffee and hang out, especially when it's in Bali! We love Ubud and can have a frapucinno when we were in Gang Beji. The place ia cozy, with authentic decor and cool merchandise. With Bali vibes, and many customers back then.","1.

2. Best evening view for Ubud Water Palace (but don’t cross inside the area as it is separate 50k Rp entrance fees)

3. when Ubud Water Palace is having its evening  7pm dance performance, you may be there and enjoy the Gamelan musical too","Update: Bathroom is out of order! Dropping from 5 stars to 2 stars.

It’s located in the downtown, just 5 minutes walk from Ubud Market.

I’d recommend the chicken sate","It felt like stepping into an oasis. We came in and immediately found ourselves in an inner garden next to a temple, far from the noise from the street traffic that was literally right there. All covered with trees and plants. 5 stars only for the place! But on top of that, the food was delicious and the prices were really cheap! We couldn’t believe it.

We couldn't go inside the temple but walking along next to the ponds and around the outside of the temple was still nice.

Entry was cheap (no more than $5AUD per person) and we were provided with sarong, kimono and headband to wear.

We walked along the main path and then found some beanbags off to the side to sit and enjoy the peaceful water fountains and Lily pond.

It was worth the money, even if it was only the outside part. Wouldn't need to visit more than once.","I think its worth seeing it if you are really interested in temples, and love to try the traditional clothing.

But in my experience it wasnt that great. Its just really as big as you see in the pictures. Not much to see.

And the clothing we were obligated to wear were so dirty and full with stains. People all wear the same clothing, sweat in it and just hang it up again for the next one to wear it. I felt really dirty after wearing these..","Some of these pictures is not the actual palace.
Here you need to be dressed in traditional clothes they provide, white long skirt, with headband and purple wrap top.
Entrance is 35 000 per person. And it took us 2 minutes to “visit” the palace. Honestly it’s best if you eat on the terrace of the restaurant next to it, you will see everything anyway. Not worth the money.","Ubud Water Palace is quite underwhelming but still pretty. The only Balinese people on the grounds are the staff, as visitors are mainly foreigners. After paying the entrance fee of 50.000 IDR you have to put on traditional clothing after which you are allowed in. This Balinese Hindu Temple is dedicated to the goddess Saraswati. There are water features and ponds with many lotus plants. Unfortunately you cannot enter the temple itself, this means what you see from the entrance is all there is to see for you.

We spent a nice evening there, but my review can't be too positive, because I didn't like the kitchen at all and the price was too expensive.
The kitchen is a contemporary kitchen influenced by the Asian kitchen and other kitchens as European and South American. But it has not a real identity, it's too chaotic.
That said, I am pretty confident they can improve it.
Regarding the price, the local is frequented mainly by the tourists, so probably this is the reason why the prices are not aligned with the real standard.","Best of the best food in Bali so far 👌👌👌
Worth the price, we went there early and no booking, better get a booking ahead of time. Sooooo goooood 👍 staff are great, location in the center of Ubud. Try their scallop, my golly. We ordered 3 at first, then add 3 more and 3 more 😅"

Embarking on a pedestrian tour of Ubud offers a captivating journey through its vibrant streets, serene rice paddies, and enchanting temples. Let's explore a hypothetical walking tour of Ubud, immersing ourselves in its sights, sounds, and sensations.

Our walk begins in the bustling heart of Ubud, where the streets are alive with the hustle and bustle of locals and tourists alike. Weaving through the colorful markets and artisan stalls, we're greeted by the aroma of spices, the vibrant hues of traditional textiles, and the rhythmic beat of gamelan music drifting through the air. It's a sensory feast that sets the tone for our adventure.

Leaving the main thoroughfare behind, we venture into the quieter side streets, where quaint cafes, boutique shops, and lush greenery beckon. The sounds of traffic fade away as we meander past traditional Balinese compounds adorned with ornate carvings and offering glimpses of tranquil inner courtyards. Each step reveals a new layer of Ubud's charm, inviting us to slow down and soak it all in.

As we continue our walk, we find ourselves surrounded by Ubud's iconic rice terraces. The vibrant green fields stretch out before us in a patchwork of natural beauty, framed by towering palm trees and punctuated by the occasional farmer tending to their crops. It's a serene and timeless landscape that offers a glimpse into Bali's agricultural heritage and the harmony between man and nature.

Our journey takes us past ancient temples and shrines, where the scent of incense mingles with the sound of chanting and the sight of intricate stone carvings. We pause to pay our respects and soak in the spiritual atmosphere, feeling a sense of peace and reverence wash over us.

As the day draws to a close, we make our way to the outskirts of Ubud, where the sounds of the jungle replace the chatter of the streets. Here, hidden away from the hustle and bustle, lies the sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary. Entering its leafy depths, we find ourselves surrounded by towering trees, moss-covered temples, and mischievous macaques playing in the dappled sunlight. It's a magical oasis that transports us to another world, where nature reigns supreme and ancient spirits dwell.

As twilight descends, we reluctantly bid farewell to Ubud, knowing that our pedestrian journey has only scratched the surface of this enchanting destination. But as we reflect on the sights, sounds, and sensations we've experienced, we carry with us a deeper appreciation for Ubud's beauty, culture, and soul. And perhaps, one day soon, we'll return to continue our exploration of this timeless treasure trove in the heart of Bali.","People are selling the same products, same clothes, same artwork. Foods are not local price and dedicated for tourist between AUD 3-7 per portion. So crowded and traffic all the time, even on motorbike. It puts me off a bit. If you found jamu detox drink, you're lucky, coz that's the highlight of this journey."

Definitely recommend the plant tempura and the soy tofu poke bowl. My partner recommends the social signature, the bun was quite soft! The staff here are so lovely with a special shout out to Karisma! Will miss this restaurant","Simply social has an absolutely great menu. We didnt manage to eat any of the lunch/ dinner food but we had amazing brunch there on a couple days. I loved the smashed avacado and my friends all enjoyed their food just as much, which included pancakes and banana bread. The restaurant also has a great atmosphere","We recently had the pleasure of dining at Simply Social , and it was an exquisite experience from start to finish. The moment you step inside, the tasteful decor catches your eye, creating an inviting and sophisticated atmosphere.

The restaurant's ambiance is a perfect blend of modern elegance and warmth. The lighting is subdued, creating a cozy yet refined setting. The attention to detail in the decor, from stylish furniture to tasteful artwork, enhances the overall dining experience.

Now, let's talk about the star of the show – the food. Each dish on the menu is a masterpiece, showcasing a fusion of flavors and culinary expertise. The ingredients are fresh, and the presentation is nothing short of art on a platt.

The staff deserves commendation for their impeccable service.

We eagerly anticipate my next visit to this culinary haven.","Fast service: 2/5

Great place to cool down with your friends after a day of shopping in the nearby stores. The dragonfruit smoothie was a delight. My friends had cocktails and were also very happy. Unfortunately, the service was rather slow. It took a long time to order. Still, I would go back for afternoon drinks with friends."

The place is clean. The service is great. The waiter is fast responded.

The food is astounding. Really authentic Indian taste that I'm looking for. They're not stingy with the spices and ingredients. Im overwhelmed with the spice bombing.

Lets keep it a good place to eat for all the people around Ubud let us keep the business alive so that we can enjoy it for long time.

Maybe the price for the drinks is a-bit too much. And also please consider valet parking since in the area is so hard to find parking lot for cars or motorbikes.","This is my complete Queens Indian Cuisine in Ubud review. Although the meal was excellent, the service was quite slow. The staff's apparent lack of friendliness and enthusiasm in receiving orders was unfortunate. To place an order, you must give them a call at trice. And to think, for bottle of water, they charged an absurd sum! 37000 for just 600ml water bottle? Really? It was disappointing because I could have gotten 18 bottles from Mart instead.

They serve freshly cooked meals and deliver excellent food. I promise it's worthwhile!","We ordered a big box of chicken and lamb biriyani, but the portion was very, very, less even for a big box. The biriyani was dripping with tons of oil, and the bottom of the box was flooded with oil on all 4 boxes that was ordered. Also, we ordered steamed rice where the portion was very small. All the food ordered was super spicy (uncooked raw chilly powder), and we ended up throwing it in the bin.Just for reference, we are South Indians and we eat a lot of spice. It was way too spicy and soaked with oil. The only positive was that the flavour was good but way too oily, too spicy and very very less portion even on a big box. The service was the worst, they have a don't care attitude and rude. Never coming back here.","Food is awesome. Portion is also good. Not expensive but not cheap either. They charge you 37000 rupiah for 300ML
Water that is not good. Rest all were perfect.","You come here for the food, not the service or atmosphere. The chefs get a 10/10 score.
I tried coming here the night before waited at the door for a while and no one attended to us. Eventually flagged someone down and found out they were fully booked for the night by 6pm. We made a reservation for the next day easily.

Service was better once we were seated, even the 2nd time we arrived we waited a while before anyone even acknowledged us. I feel the lack staffing was the cause of the issues.

Ps. definitely get the Rogan Josh, lamb was so tender 😍"

Its right next to UBUD palace and the on the main road. You can enjoy yummy dishes and chill with live music. You can also request your songs. We tried Chicken tikka masala, channa chat, bread which were delicious. We also tried Mango Lassi and Lemon Soda which were good. They also have good shisha with PAN RASNA flavor.... With that the indian ginger tea was just awesome.

Would really recommend this place if you nearby the UBUD PALACE. Sit and relax here.","you guysss …. this is the best biryani I’ve ever tasted. they are served with big portions that enough for 2 people. also the naan is WOW. for the drink please order mango lassi. it’s so refreshing 💯 never thought i would be this addicted to indian food LOL.

the staff are very friendly. as an indonesian i was confused what to order and she told me  which food/drink that i might like or don’t like.

i am happy i visited here 3 times during my stay in Ubud",The place is situated in the heart of Ubud. It is a beautiful restaurant and for experience prefer sitting at the back. Dinner is better as the place has nice candles and music that makes it a nice place for a romantic dinner. The price is really really expensive. We order malai chicken started it was delicious. Butter chicken was average as the gravy was not smooth as expected in butter chicken.,It just felt that the curry used was same across all the dishes. We ordered chicken tikka masala and mix veg and both curries tasted same. Veggies didn’t seem fresh and it was sort of raw as well. Avoid this place

The performance can be seen from across the lotus pond. Taste can be better, It appears that you go here for the experience rather than the food. I wasn't impressed, but it wasn't bad.","Cafe Lotus located within Saraswati Temple complex in Ubud and offers a combo entrance ticket with breakfast, if you visit in the morning time. Superb ambience with various seating options. Friendly staff spoke very well and food was tasty. The breakfast is worth the experience of that place and we enjoyed it. Do visit !! 😋","Nice setup on the garden of the temple, can watch the show during dinner, good with family or group as having space and not stucked in the uncomfy chair of the show.
However, food is ok, less nice than the ones i had in Ubud ( expectation is high). Service+taxes on top = 21%."

Very reasonable as well.

Good juices also.",We got the full plate no soup with a side of fried pork. It was fantastic. The pork skin are fried pork were the pest parts.,"Came here to try since there were so many good reviews. Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype.

Ant of course, a vegeteriana pizza is the winning pizza for us.

On the second time we couldn't skip the tartare di tonno & vegeteriana pizza so we ordered both again, but this time we switched it up with the pasta and tried the amazing cellitti al tartufo which was so delicious with a not too strong taste of truffle oil.

Don't skip a visit in this amazing spot, best Italian restaurant in Ubud, by far!!","Great food, good mood. Definitely a place for you to hang out with friends. Vegetarian options are also definitely readily available, just request for it.","Best Italian restorant in Ubud period. Great lunch specials. Incredible calsone.

Calzone is amazing!!! So much cheese 🧀
Wine 🍷 is great!
Pizza burrata is to die for 🤌
Also service now is so good! Maybe because managers are always around. Don’t want to leave Bali because of this pace! Even though my next destination is Italy 🇮🇹😄🤌

Alternatively you may just start from another end, then is 100% walking friendly.

This is better than Campuhan in my opinion where we only enjoyed first few minutes with the temple and Bali jungle feel, just too many people in a narrow walkway.","Very easy trail with some nice views of the rice fields right in the heart of Ubud. The entrance is a little sketchy, but once you walk around the building and see the signs for the trails the walk is level and pretty well maintained. Not a ton of shade so it’s hot in the sun, but still lovely to see.
