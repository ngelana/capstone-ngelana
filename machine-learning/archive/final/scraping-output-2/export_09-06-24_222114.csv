Patrick the host is very welcoming and makes you feel at home . The view from the place is amazing. If you love nature this is the place to visit.","We had an incredible stay at Villa Markisa! Patrick, our host, was not just welcoming but truly inspiring, immersing us in the richness of Balinese culture. From vibrant ceremonies to an insightful tour of an Arak distillery, Patrick and Wayan made our experience unforgettable. The hotel itself is a gem—impeccably clean, stunning views, and a fantastic pool. Highly recommend this unique and culturally enriching retreat! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","If you want to experience the real Bali - out of the turistic tracks - this is where u should stay! In the middle of the North island countryside, in a traditional village, surrounded by rice fields, you will find quietness, learn a lot about the Balinese culture and its customs, eat marvelously, sleep well, and enjoy freshness in the pool! A scooter ride away from the sea, you’ll be able to organise one-day trips around and discovery all what the North has to offer. I highly recommend Villa Markisa Pakisan, it is a place that I will always remember!","We spend 4 nights/5days at Villa Markisa and it was amazing!

We took it easy and relaxed a lot at the pool and loved the charm of the beautiful surroundings which feature many rice terraces.

Breakfast was really good (Crepes with fruits as well as toast and coffe or tea) & we were happy to try new fruits we have not eaten before. Make sure to try the passion fruit which is out of this world!

We rented a motorbike directly at the hotel and explored the surroundings (trips to the sea, Mount Batur or lake Bratan are a good tip).

Patrick is a very inspiring and helpful person and he always made us feel welcomed and like at home. Thanks to him we got to discover the Balinese culture much more in depth as he told and showed us many aspects we did not know before.

We would 100% recommend staying here if you want to discover authentic Bali from the comfort of a beautiful home."
