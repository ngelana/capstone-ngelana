Manggis, Kabupaten Karangasem, Bali 80871, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=3926797493013997272,OPERATIONAL,+62 811-189-624,resort_hotel,"resort_hotel, hotel, lodging",4.9,78,,"Unbelievably under-rated, I wish I can keep this blissful retreat a secret for myself.

The view from Manggis Garden is incredibly breathtaking! Perched on the hillside (300 metres above sea level on my watch!), every corner offers panoramic views of the surrounding tropical landscape and the sea beyond, where Nusa Penida can be seen in a distance.

The kitchen serves up simple but delicious local dishes - all homemade. Be warned with the hot fiery sambals they serve. I hear owner Bruno makes authentic French breads and pastries too. That will be something to try for my next trip.

Do ask lady owner Kusmiatun anything about Bali travel and advice, she has the best knowledge and tips! She speaks good English, is well connected with the locals and supports their trade. So if you need a trekking guide or information on Bali/Lombok island-hopping, she can help guide you and book at affordable rates.

My stay at Manggis Garden was nothing short of magical. The combination of stunning natural surroundings, impeccable service, and a deep respect for local culture left me with cherished memories. I am missing the cats and Pom! Leaving with my mind rejuvenated and my heart full, this will definitely not be my last time to this paradise on the hills.","This place is amazing and highly recommended! Up in the hills of Manggis a perfect place to have a quiet, relaxed time. The view is stunning, no noises except nature ones.
The food is definitely cooked with love and great experience, tasted so good - definitely the best balinese meals I had so far.
The bungalows are clean, beautiful and have small, well equipped kitchens where you could also prepare your own meals.
The dive center looks professional and well organized. I've not been diving with them but as an instructor I would definitely recommend it to do so - many amazing dive sides are close by.
I enjoyed my stay so much - thank you!","A little piece of heaven, with stunning views down to Padangbai, gorgeous accommodation and super-friendly staff! So easy to relax here! The only 'downside' is that you ideally need transport, although the staff are very helpful in arranging a car or motorbike if needed.","We came across the owner of this resort as my partner and I had walked all the way from Sidemen and got lost and we still had a very long walk to go and had been unable to get a taxi. We saw this resort and went in to ask for help. She was very kind and spoke fantastic english. The facilities were beautiful, rooms looked lovely, nice dining area and she gave us a drink each whilst we cooled off and had a lovely chat. Gave us some fantastic information about places to go and beautiful beaches. She spoke to us about the diving courses she does as well which sound fantastic and at a very reasonable price. She also does tours for the people that stay here and can do trekking.
In the end she offered us a lift down into one of the near towns and sorted a taxi for us for the rest of the way- all without asking for a penny! She is a very kind and wonderful person- if we were in the area for longer would have definitely booked to stay here. Highly recommend.
Great location.
Beautiful views.
Clean and nice facilities/room/finding area.
Host very kind and informative.
5 ⭐️","We came as a family of 4 and our 3 nights stay was an amazing experience! Manggis resort is a hidden gem. Its staff is incredibly friendly, cottages are charming and its location is a perfect gateway from the bustling/ more visited locations. We'll definitely come back!"
