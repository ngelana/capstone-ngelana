With an impressive array of organic chocolate varieties, they've got something to suit every taste bud. What sets them apart is their unique packages, offering not just delicious treats but also cocoa farming education and chocolate molding sessions topped with a scrumptious lunch. The store itself is a delight to explore, with impeccable presentation and testers available for all their flavors. Bonus points for the fantastic playground and ample parking ‚Äì making it a win-win for both kids and adults alike!","Thank you ! It was an amazing experience, we enjoyed the tour, educational material and the tasting.

We paid 115 IDR per person for the tour and making chocolate. They were ok with only one paying, the one that will make the chocolate.

Thank you, highly recommend this place",Great for studying cocoa.Highly maintained and also have a souvenir shop.The education program has facilities cocoa tree and machine replicas.,The have backyard for kids play and good place to learn how to make chocolate.,"We had a fun despite there is practically nothing to see. There is exposition of some machines. We have got short explanation close to cocoa tree with cocoa been and they let you taste it, then you can play with melted chocolate and get 6 pralines out of it actually maybe done before as not enough time to cool down. Half of surface is a big souvernirs shop.

Maybe with kids it could be more engaging but for adults you can skip.

Aftertaste is that chocolate you taste and buy are different. It is also not true chocolate but rather chocolate like product in EU sense. Also you can buy it somewhere else on Bali.

If I would knew it before I would skip visiting this shop."

Good taste, good food. There are some others around, funny pig statues on the wall.","Insane! This is the best ever. It is perfect in every part. The soup, the rice, the pork. All of them are perfectly delicious. For 5 packages (nasi campur + soup) + 5 hot tea only 125.000 rupiah. That was crazy cheap","This is undoubtly THE BEST babi guling in the entire Bali. I tried all the others, and they tasted fine. But this one is HEAVENLY. I will undoubtedly drive all those miles fron kuta just to eat one portion of this babi guling. And I encourage everyone to do the same.","Enak sekali, absolutely delicious. Locals only joint, beats the tourist stop. The all mixed platter with rice is about Rupiah 25k, which is a good bargain as you get to taste different cuts of the meat. Also loved the accompanying soup!!"

Must try if you travel to Bali North.,Spicy chicken and duck from gili manuk west bali is my favorite food while visiting bali. DONT EVER TRY it if you cant eat spicy food. I tried the sate lilit that given for free by the chef. The taste is yummy. This is an option if you dont like spicy food. The warung is my first option for betutu when we are not in gili manuk. I like men tempeh betutu the most.,Had quick dinner here. The presentation could have been better and it should be served in standard recipe. We ordered Ayam Betutu 1/4 but it came up with very dry fried chicken with small size. And it was quite pricey. Not exactly what we expected from the regular Ayam Betutu. However their service and hospitality were unquestionable. Hope they improved the taste.,"Good warung food. I was attracted there by the look of the place and big flags at the entry. I wasn't impressed by the food.
I couldn't pay by card. Their machine wasn't working.","Good food, but when I went there, most of the menus weren't available unfortunately."

The food is very delicious even though they do not include any meat other than tuna, all the food tastes like authentic Italian food. The location is amazing if you have a rented car or motorcycle due to the many places to visit nearby. Thomas makes most of his ingredients himself and sources them from his own garden. Overall our stay was very good and I would recommend to anyone who does not want to always stay in the city in Bali","Our family spent 3 nights here. Absolutely love it. We enjoyed the food, the view and good talk with Thomas, the owner. We walked to the water stream, only 10 minutes walk.  The location is perfect, only 5 minutes drive from the main road, but very quite and surrounded by bamboo forest, and vast farm. Defenitely will be coming back.",It‚Äòs an actual paradise! It‚Äôs so quite and nice. Directly in nature and the hosts are very welcoming. We enjoyed our 4 nights of relaxation and enjoyed the organic and self made Italien food.,"Thomas

Your family warmed my soul and I felt calmer. Because of the war in my country, I am worried, and now, after a long time, I feel calmer from visiting you! This is very valuable to me.
