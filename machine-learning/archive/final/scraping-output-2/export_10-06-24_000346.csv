Tegallalang, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80572, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=13880573439740057665,OPERATIONAL,+62 813-8468-5581,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.2,25,,"Beautiful villa located in Bresela north of ubud. We stayed here for a month. it’s 1 hour away from ubud center. In green and quiet part of Ubud which we loved.
The only thing was strange is that there was only 1 staff and he had to do it all and spoke zero English. He was the housekeeper, gardener, security, pool care, meeting guests and beyond. It’s a massive villa and 1 person staff is not sufficient at all. we always had to use google translate app to communicate with him and to ask him simple things like towels, to clean the pool etc.
We paid 40 million IDR and was surprised that there was very little communication and clarity regarding the villa. I have asked the manager over whatsapp (that is not even in Bali )and his response was “there should be more staff”, that’s all, strange. Managment was very off for such beautiful place.","After spending 5 nights in Kuta, we made the journey to Ubud. Our group of 8 booked the whole property for 3 nights, and my friend who has a 2 year old arranged with the mgmt for a bamboo fence to be installed around the long pool.
Our experience has been nothing short of amazing; from breakfast being made daily, dinner on request, the massages, laundry taken care of and the facilities… Who doesn’t want a shower or spa under the stars in the middle of a tropical jungle? or a local climb up a tree to get a fresh coconut?
Transport was easily arranged through gojek, as were any essentials we required.
We really had the chance to relax and restore and wish we’d stayed longer here than in Kuta. Thank you!","a very comfortable and quiet place, surrounded by nature, and they have a new place for yoga and spa, friendly staff, suitable and recommended for family vacations","If I can give ZERO STAR I will give a ZERO STAR. The owner of the villa is unprofessional, arbitrarily CANCEL 12 HOURS before checking in with the reason for the renovation. While my room was sell to someone else. I already book the whole villa and already PAID since last month.",Very suitable and recommended for family vacations. Big pool and big rooms and surrounded by nature.
