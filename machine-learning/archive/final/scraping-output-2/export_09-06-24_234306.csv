The atmosphere is serene, out of time. We had coffee, coconut water and fried bananas, delicious treats! The owners were lovely and friendly, they nicely offered to take a few pictures of us (time to play the tourists ðŸ˜‰).","We had an Organic ginger tea and an organic coffee fresh from the garden and had the best fried banana ever! With an unreal view of rice paddies!
The owner is so nice everything is made with lots of love! Paradise on earth will come back !","Very cosy place! We stopped there like for a cup of tea and to make photos by drone and canâ€™t go away during 2,5 hours))
In this space you can see the beauty of nature and feel yourself an origin part of this beauty.
Very simple cafe just at the roadside but inside you have really good tea and really tasty fried bananas! The owner treats you like relatives! She tells a lot about the plants and rice fields and other interesting things about real life of Bali people.
If I could put 6 stars for this place I would do it ðŸ˜…",So good I went there 3 times during my stay in Amed! Owners are so warm welcoming and friendly! The fried banana is the best in Bali and the views complete it! Everything is locally sourced (the bananas are literally grown next door) and prices are very reasonable!!,Beautiful. worth the stop. The owners are so friendly too and genuinely just want to share their beautiful view with guests. Tea and fried banana are delicious.
