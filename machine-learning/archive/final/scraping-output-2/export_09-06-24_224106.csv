I recently embarked on the Mount Batur Sunrise Trekking adventure, and it was an experience that exceeded all expectations. From the moment we began our ascent to the breathtaking summit our guide was very professional and took us through the route in an impressive manner .

Our guide was not only knowledgeable but also incredibly personable. He provided insightful commentary along the way, sharing fascinating tidbits about the local flora and fauna, as well as the history and significance of Mount Batur itself. His expertise ensured a safe and enjoyable journey for all participants.

As we reached the summit just in time for sunrise, the panoramic view that greeted us was nothing short of awe-inspiring. The vibrant hues of the sky painted a mesmerizing backdrop against the silhouette of neighboring peaks, while the tranquil Lake Batur shimmered below.

Thanks to Google Maps, we were able to identify key landmarks and points of interest, enhancing our appreciation of the surrounding beauty.

Overall, the combination of reliable navigation and the expertise of our guide made for an unforgettable adventure on Mount Batur. I highly recommend this experience to anyone seeking an exhilarating outdoor excursion.",Fantastic trip. The organisers arranged the pickup on time with great communication. The hiking guide was very helpful. Highly recommend,"Main highlight of the trip is to climb Mt Batur standing at 1,717m above sea level. Woke up at 2.45am and reached Start point at 3.30am to begin ascent. Walked 3km of road with gradually slope up ( so steep till the end of this leg I almost want to give up) and then we climbed another 2km up to reach the top. A lot of people were climbing as well. It was difficult because we climbed pitch dark. I just followed on the steps of the guide in front of me. No proper steps and it was challenging because the terrains are made up of loose rocks and sand. Very dry terrain. Mt Batur is a volcano mountain. We went to a hidden spot to witness steams emitting from the rocks.

We descended after sunrise. The descent was tougher than climbing up having to deal with the loose rocks and sand again.","Loved our hike, all started at 2:30 am with a prompt pick up from our driver Rafa, who kept us well informed with information about the trip. We had a lovely guide (forgot her name) who looked after us and set a nice steady pace as we had asked her. Got up there in plenty of time for sunrise. The pics don‚Äôt do it justice. Great experience all round üòÅ","This hike is not for the weak: 700m up and down, rough terrain, equivalent to 85 flights of stairs, and you‚Äôll be very susceptible to slipping. However‚Ä¶

Suarez made this journey even more unforgettable than the view. We did the long journey around to the western rim, and it took us from about 4am to 9am. He was extremely kind, and patient, and can take an INCREDIBLE photo. 10/10 would recommend trekking with him.

This is true mountain climbing, so if you want to feel safe, secure, and well looked after, he‚Äôs your guide.

Suksma, Suarez! üôèüèº"

More than 100 people with approximately 50 Jeeps watching the sunrise together which are an spectacular unforgettable experience. However, the transportation (Jeep service) are really horrible. It‚Äôs not the driver fault, it just the road are too dangerous and made your head and body shake A LOT. I suggest the person in charge for the place should start rebuilding the road so that passengers would not be so dizzy and feeling unwell. It gives you a feeling that you‚Äôre gonna fell off from the car, the leaves and twig could land on my body while we‚Äôre on the way to the head of the volcano. Also, there are little traffic jams on the mountainüòÇso there are lots of sudden stops in between. I‚Äôm shock because it seems like the traffic jams are not only happening in the main area in Bali.

We bought the handmade volcano stone bracelet on the mountain. The girl said she needs money for school made me feel empathetic for her situation so I bought two. It cost 50k for the small one and 100k for the large one. Worth to support.

Back to the topic, I end up throw up for three times in the morning, the fever hasn‚Äôt gone away until now (21:00). I‚Äôm very unwell since 7ish in the morning. I‚Äôll say people should think cautious before go to the trip.

Seriously, what kind of owner gonna curse people who say the truth? How dare you said I will get the karma? So do you haha. Shame on you when you couldn‚Äôt receive the real comment, to accept people has different point of view. What a autocratic and narrow-minded person.  I feel very disappointed with these kind of afterward service especially I already provided a strong evidence and explanation here. I got the booking under my local driver‚Äôs name and I‚Äôm a REAL customer who just attended your business yesterday, with paying you a 1600K in total. Therefore, I‚Äôm gonna edit my review as 1 star now. You don‚Äôt deserve a good review at all.

When people give you negative feedback, you just reply as they are ‚Äúfake‚Äù account who never attend the session. What a shame.",Great activity with excelent service!,"The best experience i‚Äôve done in bali,,","Really good and professional drivers, respecting the program, explaining many things about Bali and the volcano.
