ChIJO8DBBRgx0i0RhuhkbL4OOTQ,Amarta Beach Retreat by Nakula,-8.561606399999999,115.03527059999998,"Banjar Pasut, Tibubiu, Kerambitan, Tabanan Regency, Bali 82161, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=3763055174669887622,OPERATIONAL,+62 811-3997-789,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.6,328,,"I had a one night staycay with my gf here. The place is like a hidden gem, so relaxing and chilled. Staffs service was great, attentive and humble. Food at Lillys also delicious, the Chef did a great job! Will come back surely for another staycay!","I had one of the prettiest sunsets I've seen for a while at Amarta. It was such a beautiful and tranquil beach resort; with a gorgeous black-sand beach that the Kardashians would yearn for. They probably had less than 20 rooms in total, which was perfect to keep your Bali getaway small and intimate. Oh! They also had a cute little bakery inside the resort where you can get bread and pastries all day long, fresh from the oven!","Just had a 4 night stay in the Villa Maya Pasut with my partner and 4 friends. It was absolutely beautiful. So tranquil, perfect for a relaxing holiday. The restaurant is delicious and reasonably priced. Room service to our villa was easy and effortless. We highly recommend getting the private BBQ party in the villa for 350000 rupiah per person. It was very memorable. Pasut beach is beautiful for sunset, although a bit dirty when walking along it. I do recommend a walk along the beach as you can see some beautiful temples and mansions. The villa itself was great, pool was nice and cleaned regularly during our stay. Special mention to the housekeeping staff who would do a beautiful job of cleaning the villa every day. They were very thorough with their cleaning, even rearranging couch pillows and sweeping the day bed from little leaves. Another special mention to Juli and all the other restaurant staff who we got to know over our few days stay. I felt so safe and looked after by everyone. One downside of this place is the location, being far from everything and a bit of a tricky drive. It is around 50mins from Canggu and no Gojek or Grabs around. But it is nice to be far from everything to truly switch off and relax at the resort. I do recommend coming here for a relaxing holiday to switch off, swim and eat some good food. Thank you Amarta!","Fantastic location directly at the beach.  Very quite beach, you can  almost walk by yourself on the beach.
Big and nice rooms.  But no cleaning if you do not contact reception and ask for it. You even need to contact reception for a  daily refill of water, that should normally be done automatically.
The staff in the restaurant part needs to be more alert. If you don't call them, you would never get service. Not so quick to constantly remove finished plats from the tables.
In the pool area in the evening, plates and glasses could be left since breakfast. No one is constantly cleaning up after guests. The food was nothing special.  But they had an own nice bakery.
The breakfast is alacart and not buffet.  You could select one shoice from the menu.
On the Internet they promote some activities, but on-site they are not so familiar with options they have.  They needed to call for each of them.
So, a fantastic location and facilities, but the staff could be more organised, alert and active.","Beachfront resort with affordable price (compare to others beachfront resort in Bali)
- nice and friendly staff
- old room but nice
- fantastic view and nice ground area

Got room upgrade from garden view to ocean view. The view from room balcony was superb. I enjoy just sit down in the balcony for ours while hearing the waves of the ocean.

The resort has 2 pools, 1 restaurant and a spa.
Huge garden area.

Had dinner and breakfast at the restaurant and my opinion the food really good.

Clean and quiet beach area in the front of the resort. Enjoy to walk on the beach during sunset and in the morning.

Overall really had a great experience for my and my family (my wife and daughter love it)

Thank you for all the staff, especially all staff in Lily Restaurant.

Will back next time :)"

Locals often come to enjoy the sunset on the weekends. There is a river that is quite wide and rows of coconut trees along the banks of the river that beautify the appearance of this beach. It's a pity there's only one lokal warung that sells perfunctory food and drinks here.","Very often there is a lot of rubbish, at high tide you cannot go further along the beach because of the river. Generally nice black sand beach , like a part of Pasut.",Beautiful unspoiled beach. Take a trip down memory lane out here. The Bali of yesteryear,"Abian kapas beach,
Nice please for family
Lets join us","Nice beaches,black sands,and good rice terrace offer view"
