A fruit smoothie bowl, banana pancake and an English breakfast (with added avocado) a coffee, a latte, an orange juice and a watermelon juice. All were excellent and really really good price. We were so taken aback by the price that we did a double take. Such good value.
Food was very well cooked and beautifully presented. Coffees were lovely and served with a little heart shaped home made cookie.

We were very impressed. The place was so lovely and very clean.

Specifically came to this restaurant after checking out reviews and menu online and we weren’t disappointed. Well priced and delicious food with friendly service.
Mushrooms with avocado on toast is delicious. Also their chicken burger, btlc sandwhich and Oreo milkshake were very tasty. Eggs Benny weren’t runny yolks 😩.
Want to try their smoothie bowl next time!","The last time i was here was 5 years ago, it was already good back then. They have kept there quality and service. We came here for breakfast during our 2 week stay in Lembongan. They have very original options for breakfast! De chia pudding was my biggest surprise and super delicious.

you shod go to bed by 9:30 because there is nothing more to do. i give the stars for their location and warm and welcomed atmosphere.",Not a hotel guest but went there for a drink and food.

Really peaceful place after the chaos of the mainland tourist spots. The staff are amazingly helpful and always have a smile for you. There’s a restaurant with great food for lunch and dinner and the breakfast is simple, but amazing. The infinity pool melds with the ocean perfectly and you could spend hours there. The rooms are clean and spacious enough. Widi and her husband (the managers/owners) can also book tours and transport to and from the mainland for you at reasonable prices.

There are a few things that could be improved. The a/c is right on the bed. At night it’s still really hot and you want it on, but as it’s right on your face it’s not very pleasant and eventually you’re cold. The pillows and mattress could be comfier. The  fly nets don’t really work as they don’t cover the entire bed, they’re more there for decoration, but they accumulated dirt on top and should be cleaned often. The sound proofing is also not great, so if your neighbours are noisy in the morning they’ll wake you up, which did happen to us one morning.

Overall it was an amazing stay, though. Will definitely be back. Highly recommend.","Staying at this hotel was like stepping into paradise. The friendly staff, stunning cliffside views, and the soothing sound of ocean waves created an unforgettable experience. Watching the sunset was simply magical – you won't want to leave. Plus, they went above and beyond by arranging airport pickup and transportation to the hotel.

Highly recommend this perfect getaway spot!","Truly amazing in all aspects. Stunning location, cordial service and lovely rooms, seaside pool - outstanding in one word. Everything is well organised by Widi and we had a memorable stay in this place. Would highly recommend to stay here in Nusa lembongan to unwind and relax in the midst of tranquility and beauty amidst the seaside.","Our stay was exceptional! The staff were amazing and always willing to help. The facilities were great, especially the pool and garden which was well-maintained. The rooms were spacious and clean, with housekeeping doing an excellent job. We also enjoyed the breakfast served. The location was perfect, ocean surround.

Known for day light robbery.
After collecting 100k They informed me I can't go inside because you're tall.
If I'm tall then why on first place he collected money from me.
After I paid money he wants me to go out because I'm tall.
Before collecting money how can that robber didn't know I'm tall.
Later I come to know that actual price for this place is just 10k not 100k .
But he hide the board which mentioned it's 10k.
His aim is literally cheat money from tourist.
I was expecting this building to be 1000 years old but Later I come to know it's just around 50 years old.
So don't expect this house got history.
There is no history.

I love adventures. But this place is 100% not safe. We were able to haggle to a not so reasonable price at 50k/pax but the guy wanna charge us 100k/pax which is super expensive. After reading the history of the place, we entered and we were shocked to find how poorly maintained was the underground house, with no proper ventilation. It was hot and there was no light. There was also no signages to direct people over to exits (in the event they feel claustrophobic) Dishonest guide, poorly maintained attraction, definitely wouldn’t recommend to anyone!!","It’s an impressive underground warren of mystery rooms, but if you’re the kind of person who wants a guided tour don’t bother.

There are a lot of places on the island to stay but this is RIGHT on the beach. As a small property, it has less rooms and feels very private.

We booked a garden view room and were given a free upgrade to the sea view room, which was amazing. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. The price here is very competitive and the value is definitely there. The property offers motorbike rental services which we used twice.

The pool is just in front of the ocean. It’s a spot to relax and you have lots of nice coffee shop and restaurent near. It’s kinda romantic too. More a couple place than a family (my opinion)  No need motorbike to survive. The only thing is that we can hear people in next cabins but it’s a common thing for that kind of accommodation. Breakfast is great as well… just be carful in the ocean, the waves can be really strong. I recommend!","D’Byas is a wonderful place- RIGHT ON THE BEACH- with wonderful staff. It is quiet, close to all you need, and beyond beautiful. Because it is right at the beach, please expect some wear and tear from the environment (namely some rust on metal, sticky slider doors)- none of that should steer you away from a fantastic place to be while on Lembongan.

Just the service afterwards was not good! We ask if it’s possible to remake the bed because the bedding have some stains. They told us they will look for it, but don’t change it.

The atmosphere is very nice and the staff incredibly helpful! Cheap scooter service and close to very nice beaches! The rooms and bathrooms are clean and comfy! Would recommend very much and thank you for the stay!,"I'm a little divided about the hostel for the following reasons:
The hostel's location is close to Dream beach and not too far of a walk from mushroom beach. It has some good restaurants close by and they offer scooter rental services to explore the islands with. The guy at reception has good knowledge of the island, is always willing to help and loves to joke around with the guests. (In a good way)
You'll get a towel upon arrival and two pillows per bed and the vibes are relaxed.

The accommodation itself though could do with an update. The lockers are wooden and can be opened with any key, every lock is the same. The showers temperature you cannot regulate and it'll be a mosquito dance, since you'll be eaten alive. The room itself has a good amount of beds but I hardly believe that the blankets get washed after every guest since mine had several stains on it. The mosquito presence on the top bunk was definitely one of the reasons I left a night earlier, while knowing perfectly I could not get that night reimbursed. Breakfast is just american toast with butter and gelly.","Nice place, beautiful people, good vibes. Room is clean and comfortable. Made is the best, he is always here to help. Today is his birthday, so happy birthday Made !","I went to 2 different hostels in Lembongan, but Devadav hostel is my absolute favourite. the place is clean, the rooms are nice, the pool is lovely and  Madee (who works there) is the best. 🩷 I left this place for a few days and came back because I missed it so much.","Madde the guy behind the desk is an absolute legend. Has a good chess game if you fancy a challenge, full of recommendations for the island and has the hook up to get a good price on most activities round here. Will miss this second home very much."

We were here every day for breakfast. Loved the smoothie bowls and eggs Benedict! Also great for dinner (try the Pepes Ikan). Nice atmosphere and light in case of power outage (own generator). Highly recommended!,"Probably my favourite restaurant of all my vacations! I ate here several times during my stay in Lembongan and loved it. The staff are friendly, the food is tasty and the atmosphere is calm and relaxing. I loved discovering the many local specialties, and their dishes are just as good savory as they are sweet! You can go there with your eyes closed, I recommend ++! Thanks for a great time!","Thank you for this amazing night! Food was super delicious and especially the mahi mahi and the black rice pudding! At the end we got a very special, friendly taxi! Big hugs from the dutch girls!!!",Reviews did not reflect this place adequately. Disinterested unfriendly staff. Terrible seafood platter. Tough inedible calamari and pasty textured prawns as if they’d been frozen and thawed! Ate one bite of the calamari and had one of the 3 prawns and then was told I only had to pay half the price of the meal. Sorry but this is not a great place to eat IMO,"Really delicious food! I have had one of the best fresh Balinase Tuna Steak here! We have ordered also many other dishes and all was very good. This is a small family business and all are really doing there best to let the guest enjoy his food and time here. The prices are really fair and for the taste and quality you get served good.

Thanks to Made and his Chef who is a real artist in the kitchen and with paint too! 🙏🙏🙏👌👌👌

Quick tip: Ask for the special of the day."

Staff are lovely and go the extra mile 😊Free lift to/from boat and great bike rental service! thank you for a lovely stay!,The rooms are big and cleaned everyday. It was easy to rent a scooter from them as well. They gave us a free ride to the boat after our stay as well :),"This was my best stay in Indonesia! I came here originally for 2 days and ended up staying here for a week. Everything was perfect, very clean and large rooms, with a stunning view and air-conditioning. The stuff is so great, always willing to help with everything. You have a great breakfast, which is included, on a terrace on the ocean. I cannot be more happy than this. If you get a chance also try their sandwiches for lunch, cause they're the best ones I ate in one month around Bali!!
Thank you!!
Ps. The sunset in the picture is from right next to the guest house!! Mind-blowing","We spent 5 nights in this hotel and we were able to do all the activities we wanted without taking a taxi because most guides offer free pick-up because the place is well located (near the yellow bridge), the hotel is really quiet, the breakfast is good and it's clean (the room is cleaned every day).  The rooms are large, you really have space.  It's family run and they are amazing, so nice and will do anything to make you feel good.","We are staying here now (June 2023) and this little hidden gem is absolutely lovely. The staff are so good to us guests. Nothing is too much trouble. They have welcomed us like family. Helped us rent a scooter. Assisted us with a room change (not that the first room wasn’t lovely). Breakfast is very good. Pool is very nice. WiFi is good enough to stream Netflix. Shower has warm water (not super hot, but it’s fine) The view from the balcony is beautiful. Absolutely lovely here. Thank you, Seaweed Guest House and especially thank you to the staff 😍"

A great ambiance with perfect lighting and hues from the sunset. Give this one a go, good menu and drink selection.","Chicken Satay here tastes quite delicious and the presentation at this place for all the items I tried is 10/10.

The waiters are warm and engaging. Very nice to see the chef also come out and chat about the dishes!",Very good service here. Came here for super early breakfast before diving at 7am… it was open and the chef cooked a nice nasi goreng for me . It was very very filling and the meat was a lot. The service staff are very sweet and polite girls who go about their work diligently and joyfully. There’s nice brownies next door which I ate on the dive boat - very delicious and chocolatey!,"Delicious and great value pain au chocolat (8K each)! We were lucky enough to get some straight out the oven and they are some of the best we've had since being here.

The rest of the menu and coffee is all OK, but not as standout as the bakery."

We loved the hotel experience ! Thank you so much.
If we ever come back to Nusa Lembogan, we'll be back.","This place is top notch.  From the location, room, staff, etc.  I Wayan is owner is super nice.  Very helpful...

The staff is lovely and always make themselves available to make your stay more enjoyable.

The location is also super nice.  It looks towards the south with a view of a little bay full of seaweed ""farms"".  It is quiet but easy enough to get to anywhere shoilnyou need more noise!

The rooms are lively.  We were assigned 3 cottages on the front row. You can see from the pictures I'm sharing.

The eating area is a pleasant place to sit around.  Normally there is always a breeze.

The pool, while it is small, is absolutely nice to be dipping your bodies.  In the morning, after snorkeling, and late in the evening.

Should you need a ""taxi"" to go to places in Lembongan, you can call Putu.  He happens to be a childhood friend of the hotel owner.  Super nice guy.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone.","My husband and I had an amazing experience there! It is a family business and all the staff members are so friendly and always happy to help us. Breakfast is good too. Hiring a motorbike is a great idea, but they also can organise pick ups and drop offs with restaurants as the place is a bit far from the centre.","Wayan and family make you feel totally welcome and help you with scooter hire or any tours.
Great breakfast and basic restaurant
Beautiful pool and cold bintangs
Rooms are comfortable standard island bungalows with good wifi and air con.
Located not too far from Dream Beach or Mushroom Bay however a scooter is required to get around.
Thanks Wayan...will be back","The loveliest little getaway spot on the island. Outstanding service, the staff is kind, friendly and attentive. It’s a clean and very comfortable. The breakfast was delicious. The dining area is so peaceful and has great views overlooking the bay while watching the locals fish. It felt authentic here, not too touristy, which we loved. The treated our 8 year old incredibly, and made sure he was having a good time too. I hope we can come back! Thank you for the most perfect stay."

The obvious fact is that the owner doesn’t care that much. The nets were mouldy, no kettle in the room, the TV wasn’t working and initially no fridge - I had to ask for it. The Wifi was floppy and I was told by the staff that the owner was informed about that multiple times and still do nothing about it.
The place has a great, deep pool and a restaurant especially for dinner. It’s very close to Dream Beach and Devil’s Tear which made the location incredible.

What makes this place special is the staff. They are incredibly helpful and friendly. Special shoutout to 2 special boys. Michael -  he taught me how to ride a bike and was just incredibly caring and sweet & Vincent, who was really funny, trustworthy and hardworking. They made me fell welcomed and safe as a female solo traveler. Both of those boys definitely deserve a raise!",The location is amazing. The rooms are quite spacious and clean. We loved the pool & food is delicious! Highly recommended :),"“Value for money”

We stayed there 1 night. it was a wonderful stay there. you can just walk to dream beach, devil's tears. they also have scooter rental and food facilities. the staffs are very co-operative.","Really very nice accommodation. Here you will find a place to linger. Because we liked it so much here, we even booked two more nights, even though we had already booked another accommodation. The small cabins are very nice, the beds are comfortable and the rooms are equipped with air conditioning. Everything is clean. There are beautiful beaches nearby. The courteous staff is always available for excursions or further trips. Even spontaneous requests are implemented immediately. Absolutely recommended and I would come here again and again.","We have just stayed here for two weeks , two lovely villa huts 2 adults 2 teenagers and an 8 year old . The villas are basic but have all you need and are cleaned everyday . The pool was a great size and very deep . The gardens are very pretty . There restaurant Wikarander served up fabulous meals the lobster my favourite and the pork ribs were huge. Staff were very kind and the manager Vincent went over and above . The owners were also very lovely . For the price we paid it was a bargain ."

It’s located a bit outside de busy area so a scooter would be nice to have. But there are some warungs you can walk to. I would definitely recommend!","Highly recommended! We enjoyed three nights at Gedong Nusa. It's exactly what we needed, a quiet and clean spot with a simple but good breakfast and a beautiful pool for a morning dive. The most important thing is the great service we got from this lovely family.
They rented us scooters for the best price we got on the trip, took care of the laundry, and helped with any requests we had with a smile.","Stayed here for 2 nights and had a pleasant stay. The staff was very friendly and gave great tips on what to do around the island. Putu was especially helpful when we checked in and throughout our stay. We were able to check in early because the room was ready early which was nice as we arrived at 9:30am and checkin is at 2. We were able to rent a decent motorbike for 100,000 (medium sized bike, had a small and large available as well) and they filled up the gas tank most of the way for us. The hotel itself was nice as well with a pool in the middle of all of the bungalows and in a quiet location. The hotel was also close enough to most of the attractions on the island that you could walk within 20 minutes or scooter within 5. The rooms were spacious and clean and we loved the outdoor (but enclosed) bathroom style… it was very peaceful. The fact that they had a mini fridge in the room was a plus so we could keep our water cold. The bed and pillows were comfortable and we liked the fact that there were 4 pillows on the bed. They had free water refill, which we loved so we could save on plastic use. AC worked very well and cooled the room quickly. The breakfast in the morning was delicious, but we did find the portions to be slightly on the small side. We ate dinner at the restaurant one of the nights and we really loved the food… lots of yummy flavor and at a reasonable price. I would highly recommend staying at Gedong Nusa!","Amazing experience , the location is just perfect, the staff is so helpful and so kind. This place is a little paradise, the room and the outside shower just amazing and what about the pool… they can arrange for you the transfer from the harbour and rent a scooter and get so many informations about the island, restaurants and bars… the food is great breakfast and diner as well so a huge thank you for those 4 nights we definitely come back !

Samantha & Nico","Thw owner is very friendly and humble people. The keep the place super clean. Room is also very nice with an open toilet top concept. Very nice. Breakfast is good. Nasi lemak is cook by the owner mum. Authetic indonesian food.

The dinner was impressively good and prices are reasonable. My children love it.
Owner also has relatives that operates other businesses in lembongan such as cruise out to watch Manta ray, snoorkeling. They also provide day trip to visit all tourist places in lembongan.

Overall highly recommended place. Look for Pak Putu the owner. Speak well english and nice people"
