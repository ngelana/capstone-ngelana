Their recipes are ON POINT. I stumbled upon this place randomly because I was staying next door and I ended up eating here everyday for a week ü§≠.

Firstly, I love Nisha, a waitress there, I wanted to come when she was working because she is SO sweet, always has a smile on her face, and explained the menu to me and gave me her favorite recommendations which didn‚Äôt disappoint. Also she is Indonesian and speaks Hindi!! Like what?! THANK YOU NISHA!

#1 - in love with the Puri Masala with aloo that‚Äôs hands down my favorite dish here.

I also love their lime soda and girivalam blueberry smoothie.

The vada pao was good but a little too big for me, I like vada pao as a small street food so I can order other things but I was so full after it!

Their uthapam was AWESOME, and their kichidi (rice and lentils) is also very good.

Chole bature is my favorite food ever, I thought it was ok here. I felt the Puri Masala was way tastier.

Oh also I loved their carrot halwa dessert!!! So yummy üòã.

Thank you for making me feel at home by having authentic Indian food in Bali!!

There‚Äôs so much I want to try on this menu and I can‚Äôt wait to come back when I‚Äôm in Uluwatu again soon!","We had dinner here today after watching the kecack and fire dance. The restaurant is close to Uluwatu temple. I must admit, it is the best Indian restaurant in Uluwatu. Food is super authentic. The spice level üëåand every dish tasted delicious.
Waitress Nisha was very courteous and attentive. She provided the food ordered in a timely manner.","This Indian restaurant in Bali offers an extraordinary dining experience. From their delectable cuisine and impressive drinks to the stunning ambience and, above all, the incredibly sweet staff, it truly stands out as the best Indian restaurant in Bali.
Bonus: Also they have some great offers on drinks! Very pocket friendly","Excellent food and service. The team was super patient taking our order as were a big group with different dietary requirements and they made sure each one of us was taken care of. Would highly recommend this place for food, service and the ambience.","While returning from ulluwatu temple and kecak dance, we saw this restaurant! And i must say you won‚Äôt be disappointed at all! Staff there speaks hindi!‚ù§Ô∏èüòç! They have good vegetarian options! We ordered paneer butter masala and tandoori roti! Tandoori roti was not good. Then we ordered tawa roti! It was great! So you now know what to order! ;)
Overall a good place!üôèüèª
And one more thing thali is only available till 6:00 pm!üò¢ otherwise we would‚Äôve ordered thali only!üòí"
ChIJIWUbb1tb0i0RmTJdqty-nzE,Nyang - Nyang Bungalow Uluwatu,-8.835155,115.0993859,"Jl. Raya Uluwatu, Pecatu, Kec. Kuta Sel., Kabupaten Badung, Bali 80361, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=3575786484115780249,OPERATIONAL,+62 856-3813-971,,lodging,4.7,62,,"The Nyang bungalows are run as family bussines so the atmosphere is very cozy, unifying and private. The staff is always kind and ready to help you with all your wishes. The location is very calm with typical Bali nature all around. It is a food starting point to see all the sights and beautiful beaches within 10minutes ride on a bike. The bike can be easily rent at the place too. You can order the best breakfast by your preference here. I love this place and you should come to here. ‚ù§Ô∏è",If you want peace and quiet away from the hassle of Bali this is the place make sure you bring a book there are no TV's which is a welcome change but also no fridge which would of been nice as you have to grab a ride or walk a couple 100mtrs to the nearest shop and town it truly is a little bit of paradise though,"The Homestay compound is very pretty, the family live on the premises. It s in a rural location in Uluwatu, the nearest ATM is in Padang Padang which is a 15 min drive away by car. Beaches are not walkable most of the time as it‚Äôs a very busy road, no footpaths, and the heat and humidity make walking 1.6km to Nyang Nyang beach difficult (it‚Äôs 1.6km not 600m) downhill all the way, very steep back up. I used several taxis per day to get to ATM, beaches, cafes, restaurants and shops, which added another RP150000-200000 per day to the tariff. I wouldn‚Äôt risk riding a motorbike but if you hire one it would be easier .I stayed in the bamboo hut which was lovely inside and out. Beautifully decorated and nice new sheets and covers.  Ensuite is nice and the aircon works well. Hot water has run out by the afternoon /evening so get your shower in the morning, not practical if youve been at the beach all day. You are right next to the families living quarters in the chalets, you can hear everything, and hence every noise you make can also be heard. There is very little privacy as the windows look directly into the opposite guest rooms , and you have to close the curtains for privacy, which makes the room very dark during the day even with lights on. There is no breakfast or food provided . There‚Äôs no fridge, the tea and coffee sachets were not replaced daily, I had to ask for more.
The rooster wakes you up at 4am every morning, and there was a large rats dropping right next to my bed one night when I got up for a wee. Lucky I put the light on or I would have stepped in it . Not too happy that some creature was right next to my bed while I was asleep ü•π IMO Aud115 per night for a Homestay a long way from amenities  is not good value .. I stayed at Grand Inna Kuta for a night before I flew back, in a deluxe room right on the beach for the same amount. Although you can‚Äôt compare Kuta with Uluwatu, the idyllic setting soon wears off , and I‚Äôve stayed in home stays with breakfast included for $15 per night not so long ago‚Ä¶","This place highly exceeded our expectations! It was by far one of the nicest places we‚Äôve stayed in our last 4 months traveling throughout Southeast Asia. Adi the host was extremely kind, welcoming, and helpful. He helped us rent a scooter and responded quickly to our messages if he wasn‚Äôt on property. The location is very quiet, peaceful, private, and close to everything by scooter. Extremely clean room and facilities, comfy bed, cold A/C, hot shower with great water pressure, nice little community kitchen with refillable drinking water, clean refreshing pool with pool towels and an outdoor shower to rinse off. It was very comfortable and we didn‚Äôt want to leave! We will definitely be back!","Such an amazing stay here, the rooms are beautiful and spacious, the grounds are so peaceful and well maintained. The staff are incredible, super helpful and caring to ensure you have a comfortable stay. Also very handy can rent a motor bike for the day and it is super reasonable.

Highly recommend staying here!"

The owners Steve & Maria were extremely friendly and had great recommendations. Check in was smooth even when we arrived in the middle of the night. They arranged everything seemlesly. Room was very nice, bed comfy, and the pool was a great morning reward after the long travel from Europe.
Thank you for having us ! We had a blast üôè","Nestled in the perfect central location, away from the hustle bustle. Here is the quiet I found so hard to find in Bali ‚Ä¶ winding, overgrown jungle roads, with all the hotspots but a pleasurable 10 minutes drive away. A couple of  reclusive monkey clans roam the area and can be seen foraging on the side of the roads

The property is on the edge of an old abandoned white Limestone Quarry, so there are views across what is now virtually a jungle valley and the cool west wind flows through the terrain and rustle the banana leaves. It‚Äôs quite lovely

The 4 beautiful white rustic Bungalows face across the pool to the view with plenty of open green space.

Sebastian, the French owner is charming and his fabulous manager run the place in a simple friendly way.

Very good value for money and well recommended","We stayed at Sukacita Hill for 2 nights but we wished we stayed for much longer. It was truly beautiful. The views were stunning and the room was really clean. The staff were so attentive and friendly. It was located in the perfect location, only 8 mins to a lot of the impressive beaches. There's so much to do and incredible places to eat. Highly recommend.",The place is amazing! We stayed for 2 nights here and absolutely love it. The location is perfect to access to other beaches and restaurants within 15mins. The hotel itself is very beautiful and the staffs are very helpful and so niceü§ç We will come back for sure!!!!,"The best accommodation we had on Bali! Peacefull, quiet, clean.

The staff getting us there and back were so helpful.

If you are going to book, make sure you get the one with the pool as only 3 out of the 5 have pools.

Its very private and there is security all night, so definitely safe.

Food is good with a wide selection.  Just make sure to order enough or bring extra snacks, as once you are there you are away from civilisation.

Definitely will go back","Loved our stay at Bubble hotel. We think they could have a quad bike to transport people from the carpark at the beach to the rooms, it's a long walk. At night we wanted to go out for dinner and it was a bit of a hassle. The last day the staff were not very friendly.
Also we were surprised there isn't any shampoo or lotion provided, toiletries are one soap and toothbrush.
The place is stunning","The only thing I gave this 1 stars for is the view Everything else is bad.

Bad experience, really bad staff that will supersize you when you get to the lobby with new roles with the luggage and would let you carry the luggage in the way back without telling you the rules from the beginning.

You will take a ride with bicycles with staff and your luggage about 5mins ride.. then a walk of 20mins inside the slippery sand.

really bad food that I was starving and I saw a hair in the middle of the beaf burger.

Their pool is dirty and cloudy . No filters with no lights in the night.

You will find ants everywhere in the bubble.
Air conditioning is bad that the weather outside of the bubbles is better than inside. Plastic smell inside the bubble.

Staff is really bad and would argue you if you ask for something. Also, if you are looking for privacy, it is not the place for you because the staff will enter your bubble + it is on a public beach where everyone look at you inside your bubble. ((Not a place for Muslim‚Äôs Women)))

I came here for honeymoon but it turned to be the worst experience to have in bali.",This is just the front office at the top of the cliff where you are greeted and checked in. Baggages you cannot carry to the bubble will be stored here in the ‚Äúshopfront‚Äù type office. Make sure all baggages can be properly locked and secured.,"Beautiful place

Good communication with host, the house was clean, excellent location near all the beaches. Loved the decoration, would definitely come back!","This place was abit tad disappointing. The host named Camila on airbnb was unresponsive and unhelpful when I asked basic questions like what is the full complete address for this place. Lots of things she/he directed me to the housekeeper to answer. The housekeeper was nice and tried to help but it just made me feel a little sus about the place that the owner didnt even know/couldn't give the address... saying that there is no exact address and only directions to get to the place.
The facilities are very decent and it helps that I was with a big group of friends who made it fun. The place didnt look as nice and polished as in the airbnb website","AirBnB failed to add photos of the passcode of the lock on the door to gain access. As a result we were unable to access the property and had to book another separate AirBnB to avoid being stranded. When discussing a refund or at the very minimum a partial refund we were instructed to deal with the host when in actuality it was the fault of AirBnB directly.

We were passed off to deal with this matter with the host, in which they showed a total lack of empathy.
Host offered a cleaning fee cancellation fee of roughly $16 AUD. Complete slap in the face. Absolutely appalling, would never deal with such an unfair and morally bankrupt owner.

Aside from the dodgy facade, foul odour and surplus of insects, I would strongly advise you not to book with this villa.","Had the privilege to stay and enjoy this beautiful space recently.  Stunning, modern, private villa with gorgeous rooms  (luxurious bathrooms!) and fully equipped kitchen with everything you will need to enjoy your stay. Very modern, new construction, lovely energy, open main level with a warm bali breeze flowing through. Mindful touches from the host such as universal outlets (so you won‚Äôt need an adapter) - which I have only seen in very high end hotels in bali. If you‚Äôre considering staying here, don‚Äôt think twice. Treat yourself to a stay in this paradise villa ü§©","in this villa big companies constantly have parties, everything is dirty, not washed, old and smells bad.  Monkeys are a completely different story - constantly briefly something from all rooms, it is impossible to leave valuable things in the house"

We had flat tire and they just easily handed us their moped key and arrange someone to fix the tire for us.
A lot of dogs, friendly one. Like they'll just come to you when you pass for a rub and a little play. The room is clean and totally great place for a gateway.
Already missed Molly (golden ret they have) so much!!!","We were wandering by looking for a refreshing coconut drink and greeted by Eddie the owner. He took us in and served us two delightful coconuts. Then showed us his homestay property and it‚Äôs really cool and cozy. He has a great concept to repurpose materials and uses it in a responsible way. We should all be more like Eddie. He‚Äôs still building it and it doesn‚Äôt have hot water yet but really, all you want in Bali is a cold shower anyways. The open share kitchen is nice to have when you‚Äôre staying for weeks at a time. We would definitely stay here when we come back to the area.","Yes, this was Maya Rustic. Now there's someone want to use the place to be an Indian Food Cafe.
Yes, i'm the architect for that renovation.

I have some existing photos. The antique goods are belong to the landlord, they will be moved, but i asked to have some to be displayed in the cafe.
