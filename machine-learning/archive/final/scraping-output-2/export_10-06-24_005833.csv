We stayed in the Villa with private pool and the room was absolutely stunning! The private pool was a good size and was very clean. The accomodation has a larger swimming pool near the reception that all guests can use which was another great option to swim. The grounds of the whole property are beautiful. The wifi was excellent.

The staff at Omecure were so friendly and helpful. They assisted us with every request. We spent a bit of time chatting with the owner who ensured we had an excellent stay.

Something to keep in mind, is the accomodation does not offer meals at lunch or dinner for small groups. The staff recommended 2 food delivery apps (Grab & Gojek), both were very easy to use and we tried a variety of local restaurants and every single dish we ordered was delicious. At first, we were apprehensive with using these apps but we had a great experience with them, the food was delivered to the villas and provided the option to pay with cash or card.

Breakfast was included in our stay and the portions were good with a variety of toast, eggs, bacon, fruit, tea, coffee.",,,,
