We stayed for 2 nights and had the best time!
We loved everything from the heated pool, the amazing view, the lovely staff and even the fire pit they make at sunset!
Being so high up in the mountain sometimes the weather gets pretty foggy, but the heated pool was the perfect place to warm up and feel like we were inside a cloud!
They have only 5 villas but all of them are incredible, we had the best night sleep in a while!
100% recommend!","Wow !! Absolutely stunning views and beautiful villas. We loved the heated pool, the fire pit and the staff and management were fantastic. It was such a peaceful and relaxing staff. Only a short drive away from some great waterfalls. We felt the standard of the food didn’t quite match the quality of the rest of villa. Overall we loved our stay and didn’t want to leave , we would highly recommend","Discovering hidden gems in travel destinations can often lead to unforgettable experiences. Alta Vista Mountain Villa Bali is one such gem, offering secluded villas, privacy, and stunning views.

Nestled amidst the lush greenery of the mountains, this hidden gem offers a truly enchanting experience for those seeking privacy and relaxation.

One of the highlights of Alta Vista Mountain Villa is the heated pool that offers panoramic views all the way to the northern ocean of Bali.

If you're a fan of exploring natural wonders, you'll be delighted to know that Alta Vista Mountain Villa is only a few minutes' drive from the stunning Banyumala Waterfall.",A beautiful spot in the north of Bali! We spent two wonderful nights here. The location is unbeatable.. close to many waterfalls in the area. The heated pool and jacuzzi are perfect for relaxing after a long day of hiking and they also have a beautiful fire every single night. The villas are bright and spacious and the pillows make it feel as if you’re sleeping on top of a cloud! Definitely recommend to anyone planning a visit to Munduk!,This was our 2nd trip to Alta Vista and it again did not disappoint! We love the peaceful location and wonderful views above the clouds. The villas are beautiful and the staff are extremely attentive and kind. The chef creates some super delicious meals as well. But the highlight of all might just be the jungle feel of the landscaping. It is stunning and just adds to the serenity of this place. Highly recommend!
