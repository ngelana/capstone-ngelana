They had a room in a separate house prepared for us(we paid 150k including breakfast) with access to a very nice bathroom and it was quiet given the fact that itâ€™s so close to the street. The owners are very kind and generous and the meals they cooked for us exceeded our expectations. Definitely would recommend!

Only downside: no reception","Very cheap,  recomended.  Comfortable place and far from the city habits.2",,,
