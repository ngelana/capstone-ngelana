But the atmosphere and service of the place was amazing. It‚Äôs right by the black sand beach, which is beautiful to watch the sunset, and there are so many activities in the club as well.

I love everything about this beach club, the only red flag was how remote the place is, that we were not able to find grab to head home at the end of the day. And the taxis in the area are expensive knowing so that you are not able to find ride share services.","We've been living in Bali for almost a decade but have never seen such a beautiful and well organized club ü©∑ The architecture is from a different world. The level of creativity is insane. Every little detail! The prettiest bathrooms in the world üåû

Food on spot, huge variety. Nice drinks. Yummy gelato. Very friendly and helpful staff. Jordan took very good care of us and we are definitely coming back to taste more of the menu and enjoy beautiful sunset with DJ vibes üíÉüèΩ","I visited Luna Beach Club, a relatively new spot in Bali, drawn by its beautiful decor and ambiance allover social media. The place is beautifully decorated and offers a lovely setting. However, the music wasn't to my taste‚ÄîI found it a bit monotonous for such a beautiful day, anyway we ordered beers, tequila, and Korean chicken, all of which were great, and the sunset was spectacular as always. It seems Luna is a hybrid of a beach bar and a family-friendly venue, as there were numerous families with their little ones enjoying the pool and surrounding areas. Be aware that the location is quite remote, so make sure you have your transportation arranged for the return trip.","On my second visit to this restaurant, I decided to experience it during the enchanting sunset hours. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warmth by the staff, adding to the inviting ambiance I've always cherished about this place. Taking the opportunity, I delved into their menu, eager to explore their culinary offerings for the first time. The flavors exceeded my expectations, each dish bursting with taste and freshness. It was a delightful culinary journey that I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience","Visited Luna Beach Club in Bali and I'm absolutely thrilled! This place is constantly evolving, and it seems like there‚Äôs something new every year. True, the staff still has a lot to learn, but they are doing their best. I recommend booking loungers in advance through the website, even though it's free, just to be safe. There‚Äôs a bit of confusion with the deposit for tables, as you have to leave your documents, but hopefully, they‚Äôll come up with something simpler soon.

The food here is amazing, especially the rolls, and the ice cream in a separate dome is something truly special. Both the design and the atmosphere of the club are top-notch, a solid 5 out of 5. Definitely one of the best places in Bali, no doubt!"

The host is very friendly and helpful. Their service is really good.  Such a lovely villa! I will absolutely always stay in this villa whenever I come to Bali. Thank you for the amazing service!,"Beach luxe boho rooms. Clean swimming pool. Private and secluded 6 villa rooms only. Friendly service. Good bar. Limited and expensive breakfast. Scooter hire available. Near by a beach spot. A bit in the interior area, takes 15 mins to get to the city.","EHOA is a great place to come relax.  The rooms, the environment, the pool, everything about the facility was very comfortable and relaxing.  The owner Sebastian and Valentino, are extremely helpful, and will go out of their way to ensure every customer staying at EHOA has a pleasant and enjoyable stay.  I honestly cannot say enough about Sebastian and Valentino, they were wonderful.  Me, my wife and daughter spent the evening out with them one night during our stay.  They are truly wonderful individuals, that have built EHOA to demonstrate how life is supposed to be enjoyed and they truly make every attempt to share this with each customer at EHOA. I could go on and on about the positive aspects of staying at EHOA, it was truly a great place to stay.  I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.","I recommend it.
Great service and friendly staff. The bedding is fantastic and excellent rest. The owner is generous with his time and advice. A haven of peace close to the ocean!","Just came back from Bali after staying at EHOA and all I can say is if you are contemplating staying here...just book it! It looks great in the photos and is even better when you are there. The owners Sebastian and Valentino are super nice and have designed, built and are running a hidden gem. Villas are very well built and kitted out. The pool, bar and garden areas are paradise. The place is brand new so why not get in there and enjoy it while it's at its best."
