The food was excellent, and the staff provided exceptional service. We ordered two coffees and two servings of fried rice, and we were not disappointed. Everything was delicious! Visiting for breakfast, I was charmed by the sight of chickens crossing the street, adding to the pleasant ambiance. Additionally, the restaurant offers free wifi, which we used to plan out our route for today's adventure. I highly recommend this place for a satisfying meal, a unique atmosphere, and convenient amenities.","Staff is very friendly! Food is very delicious like at the best restaurants. We ordered fruit bowls ü§©  and meat ü•©
For bowls we were waiting ‚âà 15 min, for chicken steak ‚âà 25 min.
10/10
The best value for money at Nusa Penida and Bali. I would make prices more expensive for the bowls on their side üòÖ
P.S.: I ordered what was not in the menu. If you want meat like I had, ask CHICKEN STEAK.",The best food I had during my trip in Indonesia. It was closed of my homestay then I went 3 times. The food is fresh cooked and the family is lovely. The food is typical from the country. The prices are really low for the quality of the meals. I really recommand to stop there if you're staying in the island.,"One of the best place I have been eat in Bali !! Everything is fresh. Gado-gado, nasi campur, curry,... all delicious !","When I ordered the coconut, I didn't wait for them to bring it fresh.  Mixed smoothie bowl was top delicious, even the food brilliant.
Is worth waiting 30-60min for your food."
