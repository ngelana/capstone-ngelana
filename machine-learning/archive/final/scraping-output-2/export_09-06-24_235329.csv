The house has folding doors that can be completely opened up to overlook a small rice paddy valley with the sounds of a babbling creek below. It was so relaxing to sit and read a book or have a cup of coffee while looking out.

The bed was super comfy and the house has everything you need, including sharp knives which I always greatly appreciate! :) Internet is fine (for Bali - expect the occasional drop out of course), and Kadek said that the speed can be boosted upon request. Electricity and hot water were no problem.

The house is perfect for those who want the quiet life of a farmstay (including cats and dogs), with the comfort of home. And just a short walking distance is a natural hot spring that pipes out of a small cliff, which was great to relax under and watch the fireflies go by.

Kadek and Roy were so accommodating, and were always happy to have a nice chat and were like neighbours away from home :) I will definitely be back!","We loved our stay here, beautiful and peaceful surrounding, Kadek is an amazing host and the house is really nice with an amazing view of the countryside, it felt like sleeping in the jungle! We were served really nice breakfast and there is also a nice kitchen for cooking your own meals.","The Best place to stay to visit the nord part of bali.
Kadet & Roy are a really nice couple, help me for all, when I was in your villa and after when I leave.
The villa is located in a strategic point, near all the attraction, I loved the place and when I left I lost there a peace of heart.","We stayed a few days in beautiful and peaceful Babahan to recoup from the busier towns.  The hosts were so accommodating. The villa was perfect, with friendly locals,   unspoilt rainforest and even a dip in the local thermal spring. Highly recommended ! üôèüåà",Such an amazing place to stay. Beautiful tranquil setting and amazing hosts. Highly recommend visiting ‚ù§Ô∏è
