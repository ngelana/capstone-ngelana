Very relax place no road nothing. It‚Äôs not very easy to find. From the Maine road follow the beach flag then follow the road in the middle or the rice field. Beautiful small passage  between field  perfect place to take pictures. Small waroung to eat or to by water or snacks. You can spend 2h easy if you relax in the pool. The entrance is only 5000,"A comfortable place, the natural nuances that are presented are very beautiful, it can help us to let go of the burden of the city for a moment ,
hope to be able to visit again with other friends üëãüèª","Very nice local experience. We went with our kids to this natural swimming pool.
Although the road to the pool was broken, we parked our scooter bike and we walked for a few minutes.
We enjoyed the fresh water, beautiful butterflies and overall jungle feeling we had there. Great to go there for an hour or two.","Peaceful place, we were happy in their pool",‚ú®
