The services from the owner and his team were great and friendly. They were willing to accomodate our request to have earlier breakfast as we need to depart early.

The villa was decorated nicely;it has a swimming pool with nice views of other side of hill.","a wonderful and beautiful place away from the bustle of the city.

So good and kind owners of the villa, polite staff, delicious and inexpensive lunches.

There is beautiful nature around and the nice view from the swimming pool.

we were there for 3 days and I had a great impression of our stay❤️","Stayed in end of January 2024. Beautiful place with beautiful scenery, the place was exactly as in the pictures.
Delicious local and continental breakfast.
The host and his sons were humble, very friendly and also looked into our needs. They helped us with information on getting around and visit the local attractions. Great place to stay and unwind if you want peaceful and quiet environment.
Cooling and chill atmosphere, don't even need to use air-conditioning at night. Great place, will be in our memories forever. Will visit again in the future.","What a special place. Beautiful piece of land, magnificent view & peaceful surroundings. The staff was incredible helpful. I had some complications arise and they went above and beyond to make sure I got my needs met. Their Airbnb host, Agus, is the best, most professional, and helpful Airbnb host I’ve ever communicated with. I am really touched by her and the staff’s service mentality. My only concern with this place was the level of humidity. During rainy season, the rooms feel a little damp even with the AC on. Due to my health conditions, this wasn’t ideal for me. Other than that, a soulful place and great value for the price.","We had an amazing stay at Sebatu paradise all the staff are so lovely. We ate dinner here a few times. Pretty yummy. We also hired scooters and went to local waterfalls around town. The place itself is back from the street, so generally pretty quiet!"
