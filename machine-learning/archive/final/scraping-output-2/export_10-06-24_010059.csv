Can't believe there's a restaurant as good as this one.. I mean, it's not the one like five stars restaurant but good food good price good vibes.. the food is surprisingly awesome, it's delicate and simple, ain't complex at all.. this is a place you can hangout and talk for some time.. SN : for Honey Orange Chicken, dangg, the chicken still crispy even after saucing it makes every bite feel the crunchiness and crispiness, the chicken still tender, the sauce isn't overwhelmed.. and the buttery fried rice, that's something I can say it's good because of the butter feels sweet and savory, the rice wasn't wet or soggy, and that's a good thing!","Literally!!!!! OMG!!! This place is gonna be my top favorite cafe in Denpasar. I love the ambience, the place is so quiet and cozy, food is ok, drinks are all amazing!

I love the vibe and when you could be here before 3PM ish‚Ä¶ you can see the weaving process up in the house. Definitely worth to visit while you‚Äôre down for a good food and chill. Yammy üòã","A beautiful restaurant which located in a beautiful garden. View is amazon but mosquito is a little disturbing.

Coffee quality is average but food is tasty, i have Tri ""Mahi-Mahi"", it was very tasty, everything was nice and also i have tried ""rice bowl ayam cabe garam"" which it was ok although it was not the best.

It is a very romantic place for dating.
Also it is a pet friendly restaurant.","Proven food by my father, because my father rarely says Delicious to a restaurant meal, so you can believe him that the food in this place is delicious! No wonder this place is very popular on social media it is so cozy, calm, and natural. Lovely place to chill with friends  and family","I came to this place for a meeting; the place is nice, though not extremely unique as there are many cafes of this kind. The parking space isn't too large, especially if you bring a car. The path to the cafe goes along a river, which is refreshing with lots of trees and bamboo. The river is small and not very clean. There's a footpath leading to the cafe, surrounded by intentionally planted greenery.

The cafe is mostly semi-outdoor, really aesthetically pleasing. There's a room for meetings or creative space, and a stylish boutique. The food is decent.

I wouldn't recommend coming here in the evening as it's quite close to nature, and there were flies when I visited, but it's understandable given the surroundings.

The staff is friendly, and they understand what they are selling, which I find excellent."
ChIJX1BExw0_0i0RY9xr5XLlykE,Villa D'Carik,-8.6148662,115.23638980000001,"Penatih, East Denpasar, Denpasar City, Bali 80238, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=4740853839398952035,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3768-8699,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.6,83,,"Imaging the scene.  It is late at night and you finally arrive at the gates of a lost temple.   As you walk further, more temples emerge from the night.   Explore further, temples bless your path to eventually you reach your room.   The hotel is a temple.

The amazing location is five stars alone.  Yet the rooms also warrant a five star rating.  Clean and well kept, the owner and staff are proud of their spiritual oasis    away from the hustle and bustle of the world.","Stunning, secluded location, secret temple resort with majestic views, excellent food and the most attentive staff.","I absolutely loved the Villa D'Carik!

The room was very clean, and the location is absolutely perfect if you want a nice, quiet place to rest while in Bali, and the staff are AMAZING!!

Talk about luxury!
The room was cooled upon arrival, which was a very nice touch. Everything was very clean, and there is plenty of storage space to put your clothes up, lock valuables in the safe, store writing materials in the desk, and a very spacious area to store things like backpacks or luggage. The room is equipped with a TV, A/C, coffee maker, and mini fridge that is great to put water in for the next day. You are also given 2 bottles of water every day, which is greatly appreciated.
The deck area is also a great place to relax and unwind after a long day of tours, or a great place to enjoy a banana pancake in the morning for breakfast. The view overlooks the nearby rice paddies, which makes an absolutely beautiful photo scene at sunset! The deck sits over a koi pond, and it is extradition entertaining to watch the fish swim about. And, of course, let's not forget the pool for a nice dip in the cooling water!

The location is perfect if you're not looking for the night life, but rather prefer tranquility and relaxation. While it is a bit out of the way, it's serene and quiet at night, with no traffic or city noise. Instead, you'll enjoy the calming sounds of nature to lull you sleep, and the occasional gecko chirping and singing. If you happen to stay during a rainstorm, the sound of tree rain on the roof and pool make a very calming, soothing sound.

The staff is equally top-notch, and they truly go above and beyond to ensure your stay is both luxurious and ideal. If you need a delicious meal, simply send them a WhatsApp message, and they will bring your order right to your room to enjoy at the desk or on your deck. They helped me both on arrival and checkout by arranging a ride to and from the airport, and carried my heavy luggage. They were always kind, and asked about my day, if I needed anything, or how they could help. Truly genuine people with pure souls who are absolutely amazing, and I cannot thank each and every one of you so much for the amazing dedication you all put into making sure my stay was memorable!
Suksma üôè

To any visitors thinking about booking a stay at the Villa D'Carik, I very highly recommend it!! A truly amazing, beautiful place to serve as a base of operations, and run by truly amazing, hard-working people.
Trust me, book the room.
You will have a great time, and enjoy your stay!","My daughter was really loves & excited to have a romantic bed she dreams of. Also we can have the spa service for all family. The owner is very kind & friendly, accompanied us visited around his complex, show his collection of 'little zoo', sanctuary places of worship, fish pool... All the staff are very helpful, picked us up from the park area with buggy car. We can order food anytime we need it, though the location a bit far from the roadway, with windy ricefield view. We also can swim in the pool freely. Quiet surrounding areas...wish to be back sometime.üòÄ","It is very calm and meditative place. We stayed there for one night directly after flight. There are many temples on the territory of hotel. One come come there for longer to learn how to do Seva correctly. The territory is surrounded with rice fields. I cannot find enough words to describe, how i was impressed by this place...
Breakfast is very delicious ‚ô•Ô∏è
We asked two or three times for water, and it costed us nothing, since it was included in the price of our stay.
Of you are searching for the place where is absolutely calm and no town noises and loud music - you gonna be absolutely happy thereüôè‚òÄÔ∏è"

quite hidden but the pinpoint on the map is correct so dont worry, but the car park is quite limited and have to compete with the restaurant guest especially in the high season, but quite big foe motorcycle park","Hidden gem in East Denpasar. Such a nice place to drink coffee and talk. Will be back again there, but would suggest the cafe to provide stainless utensils other than plastic straws.",Visited at 1405 (maps says it opens at 1400) but the place was locked up with no one around. Plenty of barking dogs though. Maybe out of business. Maybe not. Will never know.
