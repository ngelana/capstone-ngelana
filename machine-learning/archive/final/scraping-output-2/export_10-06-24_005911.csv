I took my 4 year old fishing and caught many fish. The big Tambaqui fish I got was a nice surprise. For kids its very easy to catch the catfish.

There is food, fresh grilled or fried fish served in the restaurant","This fishing pond is perfect for visitors who want to have a vacation with their family. We can fish and immediately eat our catch, which we can add to our diet at a very affordable and delicious price. The toilets here are also very clean. For visitors who just want to fish, they are also allowed to pay for the fish caught. The service here is also very fast and friendly. The journey to this place from Jimbaran is one and a half hours. This is highly recommended.","This place can be an alternative recreation place where you get fresh fish and eat at the same place. The place is open, spacious, windy and calm.","Loved coming here, friendly locals too. Minus one star because the guy inside tried to rip us off because we‚Äôre foreign. The older lady gave us the correct change for what the price should‚Äôve been.",Excellent fresh gurame fish either fried or grilled

All the staffs are so friendly and helpful. They would do their utmost to make your stay here comfortable. The views and environment are breathtakings. Rooms and facilities here are top notch. The spa retreat are so relaxing. You would need your own transport though to go around as the location is quite isolated from any attractions/spots. Nevertheless, it is the place to be when you want to be relaxed and pampered.","We stayed here for a few nights to attend a wedding. It was a wonderful experience! The villas are nestled against lush greenery and a serene river running through. Staff are friendly and accommodating, and the spa, located right next to the river and forested area, is not to be missed! The wedding was also extremely well planned by the staff, and super idyllic, with the vast landscape of greenery in the background. If you have elderly parents / companions, it‚Äôs best to request for a villa with fewer steps from the main entrance and lobby. Location is perfect for a quiet getaway, away from the crowded touristy areas.","Really loved to stay in the villa. Calm and relaxing, quiet place. Great view and privacy. There are 2 pools: big one and private, small for just one villa. Breakfast was good too.
Area is calm and beautiful, Bali Zoo and beach are not so far away.
Stuff is really kind and friendly, ready to help if any question appears.
So in general I recommend that place for stay and relax in Bali. Enjoy view and nature.","Super spacious villa. It's so quite and lush with great view of a small canyon. Close to nature, you can hear birds and owl, with stunning sunrise. Friendly staff and service.",Bali Masari  Villas & Spa was in a very quiet location. It is good for meditation and spiritual healing activities. Breakfast was average but good enough. Swimming pool was great over looking the valley down to the river. Friendly and helpful staff. Their rooms are huuge.
