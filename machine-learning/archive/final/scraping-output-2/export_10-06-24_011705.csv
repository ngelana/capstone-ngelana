The location was kinda inside, lots of turns,loops and upslope to reach but it was worth the journey!!!
Atmosphere was great, such a pretty place and not crowded, plenty of spots for a perfect photo!!! And great to catch sunset with the waves from sea crashing below the hill.

It was just beyond expectations.
Bonus! If you love dogs, there are a couple of cuties roaming around the club and they are so friendly and cuddling!
I‚Äôll be back for sure!!!","Western people leaving bad reviews need to find another holiday destination that meet their boring, posh high standards. You don‚Äôt have to live in it neither you are buying the establishment, so get over it already.

There are also some lovely dogs you can cuddle while having a drink‚Ä¶what else would you want!","Wow!
A Hidden Gem , totally agree.
This will be our RITUAL place for catching sunset in Bali. We took so many videos and pictures. The sunset and view in this place is phenomenal! Unobstructed view! Ritual located on top of the cliff, open, spacious and has cool swimming pool.

From the moment I stepped foot inside, I was blown away by the classy ambiance and breathtaking views of the sunset. It was truly an unforgettable experience. The location offers an unobstructed view of the horizon, allowing guests to witness the most stunning sunsets I have ever seen. Aldy, the manager, provided exceptional service and even surprised me with a cake for my birthday. The menu offers a delicious range of Indonesian specialties and international cuisine, and the cocktails are expertly crafted. The attention to detail in the elegant decor and the friendly and knowledgeable staff make Ritual Bali a must-visit destination for anyone traveling to Uluwatu. I can't wait to return and create more unforgettable memories at this remarkable establishment.","This place is amazing for sunset, chill and good vibe, and all the staff is very warm and care about your needs.

The beds are comfortable and it has a nice pool.

We where how we really disappointed by this hotel and it offers very low value for money. One of the worst bits is the bathrooms. Ours was an outside one (no issue with that) but standing in the shower I could look into the window of the building across the street. Also due do to the bad drains it constantly smelt really bad in there.  During our stay they decided to bleach the bathroom. They used so much it stank and we could hardly us it and we were vomited from the smell. You would think being outside it would disappear but 24 hours later if was just as bad. The service was also not great. Staff tried to get into the room without knocking fist. The staff also though they had left some cleaning things in our room and didn‚Äôt believe us when we said no and just walked right into the bathroom when there was someone in there. When not working the staff sat at the front of the property smoking and talking and generally ignoring all guest.

Other smaller points is very old bedding (got holes in it) and old towels. The wifi is also very bad and the doors got stuck so had to push them very hard. Also have to decided between bedside lamps or chasing devices. Just fees worn and dirty. Spend a bit more and stay somewhere nicer or risk vomiting form the smell.","Really quiet and peaceful place. Close to the main beaches and attractions in uluwatu.
Nice staff. Good room and toilet.
Thanks for having me!","I love this place. Satria Bungalow is an Uluwatu gem! I came to this homestay because of the incredible location (2 min from Uluwatu beach and 7 minutes to Nyang-Nyang beach) and stayed because of the best vibes.

Johnny, Ayu, Agush, Wed, Dewa and the whole Satria family really take care of everything so well. It feels like a home.

The best part is how quiet it is. In most parts of uluwatu you wake up to dogs barking or loud construction, this place is tucked away from the craziness but yet close to everything!

Book a few nights you wont regret it ","Pool area is beautiful, but the room is definitely not worth 675k/night, and to top that no breakfast.
There was 3 power outage during the first day we arrived.
There is only 4 beds for pool area, so it gets full quickly.

Its social life was amazing, even though you had the opportunity for privacy.

The place is nicely located for being in Uluwatu, close to the temple, a gym, a few beaches and everything else you would want.

Renting a scooter is almost a must, luckily they rent them out for really cheap.

Now‚Ä¶ the place needs a lot of love an generally better cleaning.
The most cleaning our room got was a little mopping and some somewhat clean towels.

It‚Äôs just not had a proper clean in years. When we went complaining ab this, they said someone would take a look. Nobody did.

The pool is OK-, not the cleanest and it gets really warm.

The staff is lovely and helpful, but there is a lot of them, mostly sitting around doing very little and occupying room that is meant for guest, especially the reception and sleeping on sunbeds.

Internet is Ok and the price is really good.","More than just a hostel... Incredible encounters and moments with the staff and other backpackers, which simply make your stay in Bali unforgettable! Super pleasant place, very well located in Uluwatu.

The little lobby at the entrance is a great place for socializing with both the very nice staff, as well as with other guests.

My room was slightly run down, but clean and otherwise in good shape for the price. I would definitely stay there again.

The staff helped me a lot with organizing transport from the airport, getting around with a rental scooter directly from the guest house and getting a transfer to my next place to stay.

The pool is also really great - quite large, nice and clean.

If it's not obvious from the listing: this is not you luxury stay in the area - but for a fair price you're getting a nice place to stay and engage with the people around you a lot. There's definitely a lot of surfers in the area - if you're into that!

Traffic in the area is not very busy, so it's also great to get used to driving. Walking isn't really a good option in the area, so I would definitely recommend getting a scooter or using taxi services like GoJek, etc."

Carrying four suitcases (two big, two small) up and down steps while the manager and staff just sat there next to the pool watching us (didn‚Äôt even offer to help). Honestly the rudest hotel workers I‚Äôve ever met.

Zicatela is my absolute favorite spot in Uluwatu! It's the perfect place to enjoy delicious food and great company.

What's even better is the warm, welcoming atmosphere that makes you feel like part of the family. The prices are reasonable, especially considering the generous portions and quality.

Because of the duration of my trip and all the other expenses, I was looking for an affordable place in a good location. My needs were minimal, I planned on being out and seeing the sights for most of the days. I wasn't looking for a pool or any other places onsite to hang around. So I was really just looking for a clean place that wasn't to confining.

I booked 2 rooms both rooms had air conditioning and the AC worked very well. One room had a queen size bed and a refrigerator and another room had 2 beds to accomodate my son and his friend. The refridgerator was a real bonus allowing me to have cold drinks and fresh fruit available whenever I wanted it. Both rooms had a balcony or outside sitting area that provided some extra space and allow for a place to sit and get some fresh air without going to far.

The staff was very friendly and accomodating and the owners are on site to help with any concerns and provided answers to all and any questions that I had. They even had Scooters available to rent so we really had everything we needed on day one when we arrived. This is a convenience that should not be overlooked. We had other friends staying close by and they had to spend more time locating a scooter rental place and dealing with the return process where all we had to do was leave the scooters were we found them.

Our days were filled with adventure and exploration and the largest distance we traveled was only a 15 minute scooter ride, which proves the location is ideal and allowed for maximimizing our use of time. We even had a full day of adventure on our last day right up to a half hour before our ride to the airport arrived.

We Lived next door and enjoyed breakfast and lunch this place. Now we live in another place but sometimes we visit land‚Äôs end cafe. Free gluten waffles-our love‚ù§Ô∏è,These photos aren‚Äôt as beautiful as these taste because I ordered them to-go but trust me the smoothie was amazing - one of the best in Bali in flavor and not being watered down but nice and thick. A√ßa√≠ bowl was also delicious. I‚Äôd go back if I was here longer.,"Smoothies were delicious and we had some sweet treats from the fridge (peanut butter and raspberry + Carmel slice which were both amazing)

My partner had a let‚Äôs go burrito and said it was okay.

I had the waffle which I really didn‚Äôt like (texture and taste wasn‚Äôt great)","Tropical vibes cafe.
Super friendly spot where locals talk to one another rather than being consumed with digital nomad life - head stuck in the laptop.
Delicious healthy clean food served with a smile.  Amazing value and super clean cute interiors. If you want chilled, friendly with good quality food well priced this is the spot to go.",One of the best smoothie bowls I‚Äôve had. Made with fresh ingredients and really good texture and flavor. Hubby‚Äôs burrito was also really good. Had some treats from the fridge that didn‚Äôt disappoint either.

However the guide we had didn‚Äôt offer much explanations of the area or the process. The garden was larger than another place we went to but the seating area and shop was smaller.,"Great place to try the luwak coffee, you have a guide that explains the process. Ask as your guide the young man named Ben, he is explaining interesting and has great personality!","Short intro on how luwak coffee is produce, and unfortunately they had 1 luwak in the cage for showcase :( seemed a little cruel :/

Free tasting of different flavoured bali coffee, but 55k for a normal cup of luwak Coffee. There's a shop that sells their coffee also after u taste. Theres also toilet available.","Radit was an amazing host! He explained to us how the Luwak Coffee is made and helped us to the tasting table. We tried 16 types of coffees and teas for Free, but you only pay 55K for the Luwak, and it's worth trying (Very safe)!
You can buy some coffee or tea on your way out at their shop. This location is also a 2 mins walk to the Uluwatu temple, so its better to combine both activitiesüòä","Though I am not that much of a coffee lover, after hearing about this civik koffee luwak, my curiosity been growing more and more.
Out here in my state in India, it is found in one shop but they sell it for a very very high price which I'll never be able to afford in my life span which is ‚Çπ 5k.
But coming to Indonesia, I have to try it first because it's reasonable and fresh should I say?
This place I came across on my way back to my homestay.
They server along with varieties of other teas and banachips too.
The prick here was approx ‚Çπ250 something, which when I compare with here was way to cheap and way much better.
If you are a coffee lover or not too, I'd suggest one must try it. As its tagged one of the most expensive coffee in the world.
There are other varieties of coffee. As I was travelling in budget I tried only the street coffee shops.
Our guide was helpfull, and when asked something he‚Äô explained it all in details. The harder was quite huge. And the process of how the coffees made from the fruits till the cup of coffee was kept all in display. I regret not buying the grounded coffee from there.
Tips is, you can ask for banana chips refill, because I did too.
Asked the guide if I could and he did.
Overall the experience was good and worth the money. You won't regret."

It‚Äôs also quiet, which considering Uluwatu as a whole, is a nice bonus. The rooms are spacious and the atmosphere is inviting to surfers. Whenever I go to Ulu, I‚Äôm staying here","Honestly disappointed by this place. We came there last minute (by our own fault) but nobody was there. We couldn‚Äôt reach anyone  and luckily we found our room with the key in the door lock.
Room was big but not clean at all. Dead insects on the floor, bedsheets had stains and were dirty, same as towels. Bathroom didn‚Äôt smell nice and the shower curtain was moldy and disgusting.
Really expected more from a place of that price range.
Bike hire was good though and the location is decent as well.",Beautiful place next to amazing sunset spot just 1 minute walk. Also only a couple minutes drive to the famous Uluwatu surf spot. The manager was super nice and took really good care of the place. I'd stay here again. Highly recommend!,Such a nice guesthouse and very good staff working there. Absolutely recommend!,Thanks for the time there. It was perfect place. Nice quit. See you next time.

There was no sign board or description relating to the statue, but got to know that his work towards maintaining peace is highly respected. A must note is to be aware of the monkeys. They will try to grab whatever you have in your possession.",As others have suggested - a statue without explanation. The fountain is not really maintained either so there isn‚Äôt much to see. The statue seems like a western guy in terms of facial features so it would be nice to know what is the significance,"Danghyang Nirartha, also known as Pedanda Shakti Wawu Rauh, was a Shaivite religious figure in Bali and a Hindu traveler during the 16th century. He was the founder of the Shaivite priesthood in Bali. After reaching Bali, he arrived at the court of King Dalem Baturenggong. Bali had suffered many calamities over the years, and Nirartha presented a hair from his head to the king, saying that it would take away the suffering.  This hair was kept in a temple in Bali. Became a major Shaiva pilgrimage site. The statue of Dang Hyang Nirartha at Uluwatu Temple is not just a piece of art; it is also a symbol of profound spiritual presence and influence. Standing at a height of 8.11 meters, the statue looms majestically on the northern side of the temple, facing the Indian Ocean. The theme of the statue reflects the uniqueness and greatness of Dang Hyang Nirartha, a Hindu priest who made significant contributions to the spiritual and cultural development of Bali.",This is the beginning of Uluwatu cliff ! Really beautiful place,"Not the main attraction of this place, but the statue bursting up over the trees really makes this place magic. (Recommend going really early, gets crowded)"

Booked and paid on agoda two months ago and booking got canceled due to fully booked. Checked online, same room still available for sale at higher price. If you want security and certainty to have a place to stay, don't book here.","My stay at this place was absolutely flawless. The newly furnished and spotless room, along with the impressive bathroom contributed to a fantastic experience. The peaceful surroundings further enhanced my enjoyment of the stay.","This place was an excellent value and not too far from everywhere we wanted to sightsee/watch sunsets/eat...if I had one wish to change anything, I'd have had a mini fridge in the room like every other place so far all over Bali (missing that prevented us from stocking up on drinks/snacks, but no major issue on a 2 night stay)

800 meters away from Mana Uluwatu, which is a must-go IMO (we went once for dinner and once for lunch by the pool). I'd recommend combining this no-frills accommodation with a couple of lunches there so you can get your poolside sunset fun with some excellent food!","I reserved on Agoda, showed up after 8 pm, there is no reception and no one on site. Got stranded without a place to stay.",They would cancel booking last minute for more money.

The wrap for breakfast was supposed to be with mix vegetables and no spicy but it was made of peppers and the salad on the side was super spicy (((

Mix veggies omelet is also a mix of peppers and nothing else

Payment only with cash
Prices are not high but the portions are not big.

I will not recommend this place if you are really hungry and if you are not the fan of peppers."
