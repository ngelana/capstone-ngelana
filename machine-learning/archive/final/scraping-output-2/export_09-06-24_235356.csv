Lovely location, surrounded by paddy fields, and the sounds of nature in the night. Great for big family, extended family or groups of friends with the 7 rooms here.
I had seen tree frog, beetle, spider and etc in the vicinity. Big and spacious area to gather, chit chat and drink the night away. Had a dip in the lovely pool , and it was so refreshing after my Batur sunrise hike.","I love staying here!
The friendly staff make you feel at home, you are surrounded by beautiful gardens and open space just perfect when relaxing by the pool, just DEVINE!
I’m in love with the design - using the jogolos and the big luxurious bedrooms!
If you’re looking to escape with friends or family this place is perfect. Close enough to Ubud but so worth the drive!","You want to gather your big family with relaxing ambience, great art architecture and refreshing air? This is the place...
Wide pool, 7 bedrooms villa, good and helpful staff.. Recommended.",Very beautiful villa. But a bit deep into the kampong forest. That's why it is very quiet and nice. But need to arrange transport.,"Hands down my favourite hideaway to stay in Ubud. I love the space, the joglos, the food, the massive rooms and hands down the staff are superb. Feel like home away from home. I'll be back for sure."
