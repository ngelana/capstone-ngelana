Strong waves and a lot of garbage. There are no sunbeds and cafes on the beach. Just an unusual sand colour and a secluded place. Entry is free.,very cool place but quite closed off with a lot of trash (or the trash is more visible on the black sand).  nothing to do there except admire the colour and water.i  didn't see any shower or restroom,"it is a nice beach but not for swimming, the entrance is rough because of waves",Soo beautifull black sand beach in the Worldüòç,"I was the only tourist there so I can totally recommed this beach if you are searching for a lonely beach! It has the black sand and just a few fishers are there, so it is the perfect place to watch the sunset without annoying tourists!"

Arrived today at 8pm tired and they told me i have no booking. The manager literally said I had no booking and get out of his resort. I also called the owner in the Netherlands and explained him what happened. He did not apologize! Very antipathic people who treat badly their employees as well - the manager was thretening the receptionist who invited us inside to take a seat and call the owner.
I strongly recommend you to book elswhere and pay your money to people who deserve it.","They get 1star from me but only because of the nice young ladies work for those horrible people running this place. Otherwise would get a zero. Ladies, run! There should be other places ( I hope ) you could work at and where your leaders will treat you well.","Wonderful rooms on a beautifully made resort. Really felt like a Dutch standard of living that I'm used to, thanks to the Dutch owners. Incredibly spacious bathroom, kitchen block, fridge, AC, even filtered tap water. Definitely recommended if you want a luxury getaway from the normal Bali experience!","There were a lot of places and there is something to compare with, but this was not in any hotel.  I won‚Äôt write for a long time, this is my first review and I hope the last one, and the impressions are mostly negative (I just want people not to get into such conditions! We arrived at this hotel by accident, there was no way to choose. Exactly one minute after entering the main building, we already wanted to return home (dirt, stink, flies).  It‚Äôs a pity I didn‚Äôt take a photo of the room (small, miserable, shabby, they left the toilet so as not to be upset). Staff was rude and really impolite.","Incredibly clean rooms/houses. High standard at furniture, hospitality and everything else. You'll find anything in the rooms from a water heater, umbrellas, lounge in front of your house, clean pool, enough towels, laundry rack...  Rather quietly located but that's personal preference and what we were looking for. Staff is extraordinarily friendly and  helpful!"

There's everything what you need to enjoy holiday. Friendly staff and good company by Gusti make it easy to find all around. We enjoyed black sand beach in front and White sand beach just behind the hill. Lots of local warungs offer simple delicious food and even beer at the beach.
Sunset  and sunrise are perfect!",Nice quiet and cozy place and nice garden.,,,
