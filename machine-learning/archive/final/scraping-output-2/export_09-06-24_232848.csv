Soon as I arrived, I knew that this place would bring me relaxed and peaceful moments I needed the most.

Had a long and interesting conversation with the yoga teacher üòä and yoga practice was superb.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to master on all yoga poses; but the essence of yoga is to try one pose and master it‚Äù the Yoga teacher taught us which is applicable in our lives too.

I will come back again for sure and choose the room I like üòÅ

Thank you Village Above the Clouds for the great experience ü•∞","Beautiful place simple yet wonderful. Very kids friendly with a big lawn area for play. Our boys thoroughly enjoyed the cooking class & trek to the hot springs through fields and villages. Morning yoga is lovely and sunrise/ sunsets magnificent. M. I on
I.  N","It was a wonderful inn close to the sightseeing spots in Bedugul, where you can enjoy the best views.

Located in a farm village in rural Bali, you can experience a relaxed lifestyle.

The air is fresh and the morning yoga class feels very good.

The staff was very kind and the breakfast was delicious.

There is no air conditioning in the room, but the area is cool all year round so we were comfortable.

The hot shower was broken and I couldn't use it, but the room rate is cheap, so other than that it's perfect.","Quite place with nice terrace view. With yoga place also. . Good food. Staffs are very Wellcome.
Good recommend.","Have punget smell and old room, need renovation since longe ago, dangerouse mold health hazard in family room and delux. Traveled with kid ,arrived late and had to leave."

The staffs also very kind, but need to maintain more since the weather is damp there can make furniture especially made of wood easily broken... This might be one of few nice place to stay around Bedugul","Very nice place. You can sleep while watching the tree, feel the wind blows, and hear the voice of birds. Cose to the nature. So quite and peaceful.  Lovely.","The right place to recharge yourself. Away from busy town.
Located right in the middle of the village, beautiful ricefield view, cool mountains weather. Not so far from Bedugul area.
You can do Yoga in here, too. There's a room for Yoga with a fantastic view.
Difficult to get dinner outside of this villa though.. better to get your dinner here.
Have a pleasant stay","Wow, truly fall in love with this small villa, so nice, so quiet, with beautiful flowers everywhere, the panoramic of rice terraces far below are also stunning beauty, the charm of this place also lies in the hospitality and services provided by the friendly staffs, room price already include morning yoga class which is a plus, and not to be missed, you could also join the hiking and walk to the nearby hotspring","Absolutely amazing view from the rooms, restaurant and everywhere! Fabulous garden too! The rooms are a bit humid but still worth it so much üíúüå¥"

The property is so peaceful, the staff are extremely kind and helpful, our room was lovely, and the food was quite delicious. We're looking to host a retreat in Bali later this year, and think Yoga Above the Clouds / Village Above the Clouds will be the perfect fit. Can't wait to return!","Highly recommended Apartment! The view is amazing, I have never seen such a peaceful place on earth. If you are looking for a quiet place and picturesque nature you will definitely love this place!
They also provide several activities which are recommended (fishing etc.) The integrated Restaurant's food was really delicious. The stuff was incredibly helpful and friendly throughout our stay.
Though, the location was a little complicated to find, the place isn't a touristic spot (in my view,  it's a benefit).  We will come back here soon. Thank you for your great Hospitality!","Horrible Treatment: Yoga above the clouds treated me horribly.  I sent them a message to be picked up in Ubud at my hotel rather than at the airport.  They said this would be ""No Problem"".  On the day of pickup they NEVER came to pick me up.  When I tried to call them they yelled at me on the phone and said I never had arrangements.  This is absolutely the opposite of how someone should be treated especially when wanting to do a yoga/meditation retreat.  I would Never Ever recommend this place.  The website said full refund if you were unhappy and they wouldn't refund me one cent.  Terrible customer service.  At least give me my money back after not picking me up for my retreat.  Super Rude receptionist.  With all your options in Bali definitely look into other options!!!!

Sarah M.","When I booked it, i told them that it would be a late check in. However, when we finally arrived, there was no one in reception. We didn't have local mobile phone to contact them. Luckily, my driver was very kind to call them for us. But after the staff came, we found out that she could NOT understand English. We needed to keep our driver for half hour more to be a translator. Anyway, half hour later, we finally could enter our room. BUT, the room was NOTHING like the pictures online. And, there were more than hundred dead insects in the bathroom. It was terrible. The staff didn't do anything about it, the only thing she did was asking us to wait till next morning for her manager. Disappointed.","We had a booking with this establishment in 4 days and they cancelled our booking to host someone else.

Their explanation is very confuse, apparently other people were 6 whereas we only are 3 people (we booked a 4 people accommodation).

The other guys proposed money to remove us from the accommodation as they really want to come the night of our booking.

Yoga above the clouds accepted the other guys (and probably their money) so be very careful when you make a booking with them, you never know if they are not going to cancel it, last minute...

First time I ever saw such an unprofessional behaviour."
