Rapuan, MAS, Ubud, Gianyar Regency, Bali 80571, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=6076953880828478521,OPERATIONAL,+62 813-3750-4707,restaurant,"restaurant, food",4.7,174,,Wow! What a beautiful surprise to find this gem off the main road. You will be totally blown away with how beautiful the poolside is. The food and drinks were also delicious. I even took him some macaroons which were heaven. Thank you!,Fantastic food! Loved the beef black bean sauce.  Frozen lime and mint drink was amazing! You have to eat here!,"Actually they have a very beautiful setting. When you enter the resto, a beautiful garden welcoming you, and the sitting in the backyard is so beautiful. The problem is, because the concept is garden restoration, the place becoming soooo hot in afternoon. So I recommend to come evening or early morning.

This is a kids friendly resto, they have kids menu, and the area also super nice for kids. They have swimming pool and heating! It‚Äôs a goood and bad thing, the good thing is if you come at evening or when the weather is colder, then it will be so nice. But you won‚Äôt swim at afternoon as it becomes sooo hot. ü•µ

They have various menus, including local and western menu. They look delicious but honestly speaking, when we tried the foods and the beverages, they are not tasty as how they are in the booklet.

The staffs are so wonderful, thats my personal reason to give them 4 stars!

Overall , if you are looking for a nice place to swim with the kids, without really enjoying the food/drink, then definitely recommended! (They dont have minimum spending too!)

Ps: we looove the rice field at the backyard!","Highly recommended the dessert, ‚ÄúAlmond Brownies‚Äù. It was less sweet and chocolate topping is nice too.
I had Mie ayam and it was slightly salty for me. Dining beside swimming pool and the rice fields is a unique experience.","We had an extraordinary experience here, very good food, affordable prices, there is a swimming pool with warm water. we came at night, the atmosphere was cozzy, and got the perfect service from Winda. thank you we will come back another time"

Had a lovely gentleman talk us through the plantation and the process of making coffee. They are located in a nice area, where we enjoyed sitting and trying their drinks. We tried their coffees and teas for free. The luwak coffee is 60k a cup, and I recommend trying it, it was delicious. We were so surprised with the service, even though they didn‚Äôt charge anything for the tour and tasting. Definitely recommend buying some of their teas/ coffees, because they taste so good, but also as a way to say thanks for the experience to the people working there. Lovely meeting Johny as well (the cutie luwak).",Highly recommend coming here to learn all about coffee! They make so many yummy drinks and it‚Äôs really fun to try all of them. The guide spoke great English and taught us all about producing coffee as well as the Lewak coffee!,"We were after a coffee tasting that wasn‚Äôt too touristic and not too pushy to buy the products and we definitely weren‚Äôt disappointed. We were welcomed from the moment we entered the area and learnt so much about how the coffee was made, how Indonesia approaches coffee production, different types of coffee and the unique properties of each tea and coffee ingredient.

I highly recommend! Our favourites were the luwak coffee, ginseng coffee and ginger tea (the ginger has a kick - be careful!). The complimentary pineapple jam pastries were also very yummy :)","Had a great visit to Mas Plantations.  When you enter you get about a 20 minute overview of the process of making coffee and the Luwak coffee specifically.  Then you get a wonderful tasting of coffee and teas.  As a family of 4 we did one tasting and simply shared.  It was perfect for us.  60k for a cup of Luwak, but definitely worth getting to compare to others.
Then there is a little shop where you can buy the coffees.  Not the cheapest, but I think it is great to get some as the product is good and the experience and people are wonderful üòä. Enjoy!

Nice food, cozy place, nice view.

I really recommend it to you. A truly joy of natural balinese experience.","The place is big and peaceful in the middle of ricefield.
There is aswimming pool at the back, that you can have fun with the children.

The food taste standard... nothing special.
We ordered fried noodle and calamari (that put as a salad in menu). I agree it is a little bid overpriced.","The food is okay, however is not enough for me üòÑ
The service is very good, also the atmosphere, but not recommend to come in the evening because so many mosquito will bite your body üòÇ
Ensure to apply mosquito repellent before you come üòÅ"

They didn‚Äôt have our reservation because they no longer check Agoda and it was non-refundable through the site. As soon as she gave my money back, she practically shooed me off the property. Frustrating as it is in a very remote area and I didn‚Äôt know where to go next. I was also out the money to get a taxi here from Ubud center.",The host family is very nice and helped us with everything we needed. Breakfast was really nice (the best omelette we got in Bali so far). Within ten minutes of walking you can find eating places and supermarkets. We enjoyed the view of rice fields from the a balcony. The host keeps the place super clean.,"This place was amazing!  The hosts were so kind.  The place was so clean.  We were able to rent a motorbike there and they got it and returned it for us.  Their breakfasts were nice.  We were able to get our laundry done by them.  We ordered dinner from them once, which we loved.  He‚Äôs also a driver so if you need one, you could arrange that with them too.  Their place is a little bit away from the main town but we enjoyed being away from the business.  It was really nice to be able to look out to the rice fields.  I highly recommend staying here!",One of the best stay in Bali. Heavenly view  from the terrace. So cheap for the value. The host is incredible kind. This was actually the only place that didn't lie about the rooms and surroundings. Quiet area. Room is spacious and clean. One downside is maybe it is far from the center. But this can give you the peaceful time you need.,"Lovely family, great rice fields all around and a quiet road that brings you to warungs."
