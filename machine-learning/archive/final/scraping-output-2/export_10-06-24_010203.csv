Overall, worth to try. And. For the price, it is totally worthed, since it only costs 20k for thr rice set, and 15k for babi kriuk. Maybe the - point of this place is, it was really hot there. No AC, or even fan there.","25k for meal with crispy pork belly.
Very glut.","I come to this place from a reference from IG reels. So it's kinda a gambling
When I got here around 10.30 AM wita it's empty, I thought it's not ready to open,but it's already open.
There is only 1 menu of nasi campur.
They served fast, 1 portion of nasi campur is 22.000 rupiah
The portion is enough for me, but for some people may say it quite small. It contain of crispy pork belly, sausage like lapchiong, crispy pork skin and vegetables called lawar. The lawar is quite spicy but overall it is so delicious.
The crispy pork belly and pork skin is realy crispy. The sausage also delicious, not like the the sausage on babi guling menu
