Situated right amongst the rice fields, it‚Äôs truly an exquisite setting to enjoy a breakfast, lunch or dinner. I had the pleasure of dining here several times during my stay in Ubud and I can safely say that the food, views and service were good enough to steal me away from my spectacular resort!","Huma cafe is the best suprise in terms of coffee places of my holiday. Is truly a hidden gem. Situated right amongst the rice fields, I enjoyed a coffee and I worked in quite at my photos, you can have a breakfast, lunch or dinner! The coffee is delicious, the staff is incredibly friendly and the view, easily steals your breath!
Loved this place! Can‚Äôt recommend enough!","We weren‚Äôt sure about the food given the wide number of mix reviews. Overall, the food for us was tasty: we got a burger and a chicken salad. The salad however was very basic and not satisfying in terms of the quantity and ratio of ingredients.

The coffee was quite good, especially enjoying it with the beautiful view of the rice fields - it is lovely!

I do think some of their menu items can be weird as per some of the feedback we read, for example the pizza.

There are various types of seating arrangement for you to enjoy spending a long period of time there. All in all, it provides a tranquil ambiance, good coffee and decent food.","Beautiful quaint little cafe surrounded by padi fields. Delicious food, all of us enjoyed the dishes we ordered such as avocado on toasts, big breakfast, pancake, acai bowls etc. The team were very friendly and communication wasn't an issue. Ideal for breakfast / brunches in Gianyar."

Durring the evening & night  time we enjoyed different sounds of animals. You may be feeling afraid like us but 2 nights as we had it was super nice experience! It takes you a bit outside from comfort zone. It‚Äôs a side of Ubud we found silence, considering other places we‚Äôve been.","Pathetic room service, whenever called for anything in the room the staaf asked us to come up from ur room to the small room of their at the entrance which was altogether thier office service area.. after calling for 3 times for mosquitoes refill I didn‚Äôt get it.. room service needs a strong correction.. the property view and the location was really very good breakfast was good bus the room service was absolutely disgusting.. even when we checked in thier was nothing in the toilet every bottles of shampoo body wash bathing salt and foam was empty

And also thier was no proper full mirror and not a single desk to keep ur belonging or a cupboard","recently had the pleasure of staying at Ipian Cinta bamboo stay, and I must say!, it was an unforgettable experience.

The interior of the hotel is meticulously designed and maintained to ensure guests feel comfortable and relaxed during their stay. The rooms are spacious, clean, and equipped with all the necessary amenities. What's more, the staff are extremely friendly and welcoming, and they went out of their way to ensure that our stay was nothing short of amazing. If you're looking for a unique and refreshing stay experience, I highly recommend Ipian Cinta. You won't be disappointed!""","Located in de middle of rice fields, therefore the view was amazing. Because it's located in the nature, you are able to hear the animals in the night. Nevertheless, we were able to sleep. The rooms (bed sheets, mosquito net...) weren't as clean as wished.

The staff were always very helpful and cleaned the place everyday.

Bonus: There were the most adorable little puppies in the lobby everyday.

Pool area was also great!","Very green area, always enjoyed our 15 min ride to the centre with this scenery. There is a cute coffee place in just 5 minutes (Huma cafe). We were pleased with kind smiles and all the help from the staff. It wasn‚Äôt a problem to rent a scooter (~5$ per day). Villa is light and big. Pool is shared, but never found it busy. We didn‚Äôt order breakfast, to be more free with our day schedule and plans, cannot comment on that. If you like to sleep in a complete dark, probably that would be a slight problem, since curtains won‚Äôt make it work. Bathroom has open space and it‚Äôs pretty, we did had slippery floor when it was raining, but the floor towels were provided. Did have some issues with the smell of the drain, but we got an extra cleaning and a odour spray provided. Area is pretty quiet, but you might hear some scooters from behind the wall next to villa sometimes. Also our villa was facing rice field and some closed cafe at the end of it, which would rarely have some visitors, just sitting there, which would make it easy to see you. Felt uncomfortable at first, but overall those people don‚Äôt seem to be interested at staring at guests, so eventually we would just forget about it and be ok. I‚Äôm general enjoyed the stay and all the space and good cleaning, welcoming atmosphere","It was a perfect place for me to experience Ubud. The staffs are very welcoming, you can trully feels Balinese hospitality. The room is spacious!. Would go back here for my next trip","The location was perfect, near Ubud and away from the noises of the city, the staff was very kind and helpful. Bonus: the breakfast was one of a kind!","This place is surrounding by rice field view on the side of each villa, and give guest a bit of relaxing feeling in rural area. Staffs is not a high end standard, however were willing to help and very understandable. The villa interior is just okay, but a bit old and need a bit of renovation, plus cleanliness is another minus point.
Only one sharing pool in the front, not in each villa. Breakfast was quite poor and definitely need big improvement."

However the nice views cannot make up for the poor service attitude of the hosts, which left us rather disappointed in what could have been a great trip/stay.

In our 2nd day of stay we experienced a water supply outage in our room. The host took an hour to acknowledge the outage and in the meanwhile, we tried to flush down human waste that was already in the toilet bowl by topping up water manually in the water storage housing. However, the porcelain storage component lid broke with no serious injuries but unfortunately my partner sustained a small cut.

We were told to pay 600,000 IDR for the damaged storage lid - an amount verified with our local guide that is 6 times the typical local cost. The most disappointing part was not about the repair cost, but the complete lack of customer centricity where one of the hosts seemed more anxious to repair the flush system to accommodate the next guests with a complete disregard for our safety. To add insult to the injury, he communicated over in Bahasa (Indonesian local language) to his repair technician in our presence of his priorities and left the broken storage lid in its original place until we expressed our displeasure. The host was also adamant for our payment in the night after the saga as he cannot accommodate our payment in the time of our checkout at 7.30am in the morning due to his schedule. What we did not expect thereafter was that the water supply outage continued into the night in an intermittent manner, making this one of those anecdotal parodies of a holiday disaster.

Our displeasure with the hosts‚Äô poor service had been compounded from the previous night, when he was unable to accommodate our delayed schedule to check in at 8pm instead of the pre-arranged 7pm due to ‚Äúfamily commitments‚Äù. The Airbnb posting of this accommodation has stated that check-in was between 2pm to 10pm. Out of due consideration for his family commitments, we made changes to our schedule which involved a much delayed dinner which had already been ordered to accommodate his requirements. Unfortunately, our considerations for our hosts did not seem to be reciprocated and it seemed like a reversal of our roles as hosts and guests. A memorable experience indeed and one that is hopefully unique to us and nobody else.","My family and I had a wonderful stay at Malaya Villas Ubud.

Zoli and his wife Reni have been the most amazing host we could ever had, they have been very helpful and friendly, giving us a few rides, booking our restaurants and excursions and so much more. They went beyond our expectations.

Not to mention the always make sure you are comfortable and in need of anything.

The Villa is very spacious, super cleaned and fully furnished. The mattress ( 200cm x 200cm ) was one of the most comfortable we have ever had and pillows as comfy as the mattress.

The location is absolutely stunning located in the middle of the rice paddies with lovely gardens.

Thank you very much Zoli and Reni for generosity and your friendly welcoming.","Absolutely amazing! The host were so kind and helpful! The staff were so nice. The place it's self was beautiful you felt like your were in a secluded little world of your own! Was the best way to spend my birthday! They had professionals come in if you wanted massage and gave taxi jobs to locals they know well, just one message away and you'll have a taxi pick you up to explore the monkey Forest or the waterfalls, butterly sanctuary, the zoo and much more! Probably my most favourite stay in Bali (third time) thank you guys so much for this experience! Can't wait to come back!","Our stay was simply fantastic!!! The guest house Malaya Villas is located a few minutes north of ubud in the middle of the rice fields. The setting is beautiful and the typical Balinese rooms are spacious and very comfortable. We particularly enjoyed the view from the patio where we have breakfast every day. Thanks to the rent of scooter on the spot, the place is ideally located and we can easily visit this beautiful region. The staff is very caring and the hosts are of a remarkable kindness. Thanks to them for finding us an excursion to Mount Batur in the hour for the next day after some issue with our guide and to have organized our travels.
We were there so well that we decided to extend our stay. I highly recommend this guest house and we are already planning to come back next year.","Beautiful place, very natural green area and private place. Love the silence around there.. Beautiful morning walk or run through the rice fields around.. owners are very friendly and they do everything to make you feel comfortable. You can have all informations you like to know.
