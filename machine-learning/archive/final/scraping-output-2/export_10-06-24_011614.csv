Balinese people are very proud of this. We must visit this. It's a great example of marvelous architecture and cultural heritage. It is the 4th largest statue in the world. Garuda and Vishnu holds so much of importance in Hinduism.
They tell this story in there. There is hall where the cultural shows keep happening. You can see their folk dances.
There is art museum, you can visit and you can also do photography.
There is beautiful panoramic view restaurant just opposite of entry to the statue. You can spend some quality time there. Beautiful view.
Last but not least there is small mall for souvenirs etc. great place to shop.
You can buy the tickets online as well","All i can say about this is place is just wow! Beautiful cut out, limestone rock and well laid garden. The statue is impressive in size and appearance! The waterfalls n ponds around just give the vibes of peaceful atmosphere. The restaurant has a magnificent view. And not to forget about the best and brilliant museum. The art pieces displayed here are just very interesting.","Landing into Bali, we could see the statue. The sight of the statue in the distance intrigued us, prompting us to make a decision to explore it further. The statue is impressive from both architectural and engineering perspectives. Also there are other statues nearby, offering ample opportunities for exploration and enjoyment. Being just over 5 years old, it's one of the newest attractions in the area.  Overall, our visit was interesting and fascinating.","Loved this experience!
Amazing statue! Surrounding grounds are also stunning. Guided tour which was very informative and we even received a gift of a wooden frame light box of the statue.
The view from the top is breathtaking and spectacular!
If you have the courage- you  can stand on the glass platform and look down to see the structure of the building beneath you!
Definitely a must!
Thank you!",The place is so beautiful and the view is just amazing! Just looking at the statues is making me amazed because it was such a huge statue of Vishnu riding the Garuda. Great place to visit and to take several pictures.

Worth the visit.,"The cultural park is very big and again, it houses, many beautiful statues, and artwork made by the skillful Balinese.

They do have a special hall where many performances are conducted, and the culture of Park has also been venues for so many big, interesting festivals in international gatherings like G20 and formal dinners.

The park is disability friendly, with ramps and many disability friendly facilities being available.

Make sure you are fit enough to walk around because the park is very big in many of them can be explored through walking. You can also rent a buggy where you have to pay extra.","It's a beautifully built park. Has 3 entry tickets, the base one is 125,000 and includes entry, one for 230,000 which includes some food and drinks vouchers, and one for 300,000 which includes a visit to the top of the statue.

There are a few more statues inside for you to view other than the main massive Garuda statue.

There are many performances throughout the day which you can watch (all included in all types of entry tickets.) the most well known kind, the Kechek Dance, happens at 6pm at the lotus pond.

There is also a free animated show aimed at young kids.

The parking is a little hard to find as it's a little far from the location of the park ticket counter. You park and take their free shuttle to the ticket counter/entrance. There is also a shuttle back from the exit to the parking","Definitively worth a visit!

We visited the cultural park on a Wednesday and had really good time! When arriving you have to park your vehicle at a designated parking spot a quite long walk from the actual park. However from the parking they have a free shuttle bus to the entrance which was really helpful, due to the sloped road to the entrance.

When getting there we had to pay 250000 Rupiah or about 15 dollars for two persons as an entry fee, which also included a professional photoshoot (see pictures).

The park itself is beautiful and there is much to see. The big statue is 122 meters tall and is the biggest in Indonesia. Thera are also a lot of other statues you can visit, and there are different shows you can attend too with no extra cost.

All around a really good experience for a cheap price!",It's one of  the tallest statue in Indonesia. I don't expect i'll enjoy it. Honestly I enjoy the art of this place. The statue with beautiful craving details.. You can watch kecak dance and enjoy sunset in the same time..

There is a lot to see and the walk is definitely worth spending 2-3 hours. During our visit, we saw one of the traditional Balinese dances, which definitely impressed us. P.S: There is a cafe with great ice cream.","It was the first time I visited GWK.
The previous year when i came to Bali, I only saw the statue from a distance.
There is a free movie of the story of Wisnu and Garuda in the amphitheater. The dances, the movie amphitheater are all free except the museum.
We have to pay extra fee for seeing the museum.
The museum is located below the huge statue of GwK. We have to pay more  for entering the museum include a free meal at @ JENDELA BALI panoramic restaurant. While dining we can see the view and hearing the live band music. For elder people who have difficulty in exploring the large area, we can ride a boogy, 40.000 idr per person. There are free shows of dances at certain hour and Kecak Dance held @ GWK Cultural Park starts at sunset, it  is free. It has the setting sun as a  background because it's held in a large  opened area as the stage. Then, the dancer invites the audience to dance together. The theme of the Kecak Dance is different with the Kecak Dance held in Uluwatu. Kecak Dance in GWK tells the story of Wisnu and Garuda, whereas the one in Uluwatu Temple tells the story of Ramayana. If I have to choose which Kecak Dance is more fascinating...I sure to say that the Temple Uluwatu Kecak Dance is THE BEST. Because of the amazing Sunset View in the sea below the amphitheater. Next time I'll write aboit it.","Beautiful grounds, cool structures, the visit to the internal viewing area isn’t of much interest. Wouldn’t recommend. Onsite restaurant has great views and delicious food. Highly recommend.","The statue is beautiful and majestic. The views are stunning and able to take pretty pictures.
However, the ticket prices could have more clear information. Also, it wasn’t that far away by walking to upper area, not sure why the free shuttle bus parked in the middle, make people to buy the tickets and pay extra to have another shuttle to pick you up to see the statue.
Amazing space just could have more organized and won’t let people think about scamming money from tourists.","Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park: A Marvel of Bali

Bali's Garuda Wisnu Kencana (GWK) Cultural Park is a testament to the island's rich cultural tapestry and artistic prowess. The park's centerpiece, the **Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue**, stands as a colossal embodiment of one of Hinduism's most revered deities, Lord Vishnu, and his vahana, Garuda. This towering monument is not just a feast for the eyes but also a symbol of spiritual guidance and protection for the island.

A Cultural Experience Like No Other

Tourists flock to GWK Park to bask in the glory of this **120-meter tall statue**, which is among the tallest in the world. The park itself sprawls over 60 hectares, offering a multitude of cultural experiences. From traditional dance performances to cinematic presentations, the park is a vibrant hub of activity that showcases the best of Balinese heritage.

The Statue: An Artistic Wonder

The Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue is a marvel of modern engineering and traditional artistry. Its design and construction are a source of pride for Indonesians and a highlight for visitors from all corners of the globe. The statue's intricate details and sheer size are a testament to the skill and dedication of its creators.

Cultural Insights and Activities

GWK Park is not just about the statue. It's a place where culture comes alive. Visitors can enjoy **Kecak dance performances**, explore **art exhibitions**, and even participate in cultural workshops. The park also offers a variety of dining options, where tourists can savor local Balinese cuisine while enjoying panoramic views of the park and beyond.

Considerations for Visitors

While the park's attractions are undeniably impressive, some visitors have noted that the **ticket price of 285K** may not fully match their expectations. It's important to consider that there may be a wait time to ascend to the top of the statue, and the view from the summit may not always be available or as panoramic as anticipated. This feedback is valuable for future visitors to set the right expectations before their visit. So buy the cheaper version, which is probably half the price.

Conclusion

GWK Park is a must-visit destination for those looking to immerse themselves in the beauty and culture of Bali. While the experience at the top of the statue may vary, the cultural and artistic offerings throughout the park more than compensate for this. Visitors are encouraged to explore all that GWK Park has to offer and take part in a celebration of Balinese culture that is both grand and intimate."

We love every part of this villa, nicely designed and well maintained. Thank you Akhyana and the staffs for giving us the wonderful experience in this beautiful and secluded villa.","The first thing that hits me arrive in here is the room of this villa- the clealiness of room is good and really quiet area. Also, the friendliness of the staff  when I arrived at the villa. The staff assist me well and clearly for used villa's facilities.

Speaking of location, Akhyana has the best rootop view. You can enjoy the sunset views over Garuda Wisnu Kecana. It's show the serene of Jimbaran Bali.  Unfortunately, the road is quite challenging for cars and scooter. It'd be recommended have good scootering skills to reach this place.","If you like a secluded, tranquil and private place, far from the roadway noise and party people, this would be the perfect choice. This place is in the middle of nowhere, and feels like in savanna. And the view of GWK on the top of the restaurant is a cherry on top.
The access is like what everyone reviewed and really dark at night, but is nothing more than “jalan kampung” and not an issue to me. I think that is the price for the solitude they have to offer.
Some of the utensils are in very bad condition and needs to be replaced with the ones.
Overall, I really like this place. Will definitely come here again if I want to escape myself far far away.","This villa is recommended if you're looking for a place that is quiet & private. The road up to the villa can be quite challenging for either cars or bike. It'd be recommended holidayers have good scootering skills.

Located next to GWK, you'll literally passby the entrance to GWK before turning to a small access road to climb the hill up to the villa.

The condition of the villa is not spanking brand new, however you could tell maintenance effort have been put in.

Inside the villa, you will enjoy ultimate privacy, with high walls surrounding you, and a private mini pool with 2 submerged water jets removing any fallen petals or leaves, with nice tropical plants providing some shade.

We love how the place is cleverly designed and furnish. The unit we stayed in have very strong aircon, just what we needed.

They also provide a Harman Kardon portable Bluetooth-enabled speaker that we feel is very thoughtful.

There's also a nearby local up-scale supermarket (Pepito Market) for you to grab your groceries or supplies. This is roughly around 5-7mins ride from villa. You'll have to cut through GWK to get there.

There's even a cute one-eyed kitty(Mochi) that came to visit us in our villa which we loved it since we're cat lovers. Apprently it's a resident cat that the staffs are feeding.","The place is in the middle of nowhere and access is difficult, you can’t walk to any shops or restaurants so scooter hire is a must.
They offer scooters but at a very high price because you can’t go anywhere else. The restaurant for is “Ok” but limited and if you want seafood you have to order 24hrs in advance. After hiring a scooter for 2 full days we wanted to hire one for just 2hrs to go to dinner but they said we have to pay for the whole day.
The place is showing it’s age and needs a lot of repair and maintenance there are lots of broken things everywhere.
Also staff speak and understand very little English."

We had a hot chocolate and a pumpkin spice latte. The hot chocolate was really delicious and the guy who made it was very courteous and friendly. The pumpkin spice latte was also delicious but could have a little more spices but overall pretty good."

When we’re about to take a pict, those dancers deliberately left our son while shaking their butts to mock us.

They only did this (shaking their butts) everytime our three years old son yelling out “Mau foto sama Barong” or “I want to take a pict with Barong” 3 times in a row.

What a shame for a globally known tourist attraction.

Update:
After we left the place, we met the dancers outside the theatre (they already undressed the Barong costume, but we recognized them through their pants).

They pointed at us while taking laughs.

Been here before several times before, but this is the first time we got disappointed by the service here.

Very unethical.

Bonus:
1. Picture of my son sitting at the front row of the show. Showing all of his excitements towards Barong before getting destroyed by the dancers.
