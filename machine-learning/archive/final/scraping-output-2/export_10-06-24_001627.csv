Charming little wooden cottages decorated with taste. Each of them spread around a beautiful infinity pool and a luxurious garden. A little cozy restaurant available on the spot offering a good variety of local and international dishes. On our visit, we had the pleasure to meet the owner, a very friendly guy.","Amazing place in the ricefields away from the crowded center which I really appreciated. I felt really immersed in nature and loved all the details and care that's given to the place. Perfect if you want to walk around or run.Great atmosphere, super friendly staff and delicious food at the on-site restaurant, great massages...My favorite place in Bali so far!","Such a lovely place between the rice fields. If you expect Ubud‚Äôs hustle and bustle, you are in the wrong place. But if you are searching for peace, quiet, great food, the friendliest people, and a great starting point for your motorbike explorations of the nearby villages, ricefields, temples and more - you are in heaven! üòç","Nicely done place, possible to do some short walks from there...could they perhaps find a few walks that guests could do and inform? Staff were lovely and cooked good lunch and dinner. Had an issue with the booked extra mattress being wet...but these things happen and we made do with cushions. It seems good value...but breakfast is expensive and not included. 85k for a nasi goreng and a drink...then x3 means the cost goes up 50%. So that really brings the whole thing down unfortunately.","Absolute heaven , beautiful rooms, artisticly designed, each special. I stayed 7 nights here in the big blue cottage. Wayan, Susi and the group working there were so hospitable, it was admirable. I wish I could give this place 10 stars."

I have to say. We were lucky to be accommodated in the one with the biggest balcony. Keep in mind. One other villa has a smaller balcony and two others have none.

Our villa had an amazing view over the jungle on one side and a swimmingpool on the other side. Service was great. Breakfast was served on our balcony. Even the table was set.

Just keep in mind: it's quite far from Ubud Centre, the shuttle service is very limited (once a day), there are no restaurants around and the food in stock is limited,  because cock fighting is populair here, you hear many roosters during the night.","Great view and I love the morning tranquility of the place. This place is also good for yoga and meditation. Morning walks around the area are awesome! Newly renovated villas are nice, clean and comfortable. Definitely value for money!",We did the ATV ride it was fun but not for a beginner rider.,"Amazing place , the pool is great , the jungle around is just super nice",Amazing view and relax üòé
