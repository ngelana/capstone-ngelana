The authentic local vibe added a unique charm to the experience. From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the serene beauty of the surroundings.

The villa itself was a haven of tranquility. The spacious rooms were impeccably clean and tastefully decorated, blending modern comfort with traditional aesthetics. Waking up to the mesmerizing view of the rice fields from my window was truly a amazing.",Simply a Cozy Modern Classic Villa to feel living in a private rural place that close to the ricefield. Excellent place to stay to together with Family & Friends. Definitely come again to the Kubu Astina in the future,"Thank you for the special room decoration; we truly appreciated it. We highly recommend Kubu Astina for accommodation and relaxation because the ambiance is incredibly relaxing. The service is friendly, prompt, and immaculate.

Thanks Kubu Astina.","We loved staying at Kubu Astina in Sawan village and wouldn't think of this property as Bed & Breakfast.  This is a humble and lovely modern holiday home in Sawan village.  Kubu means a place to live or a house, and this place practically provided us with everything we need for our holiday, simply everything. And it is SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL.  Surrounded by green rice paddy fields, coconut and durian trees, this property is pretty much well managed by the owner and the staff who takes care of our needs during our holiday. Both bedrooms conveniently facilitated with aircon. The one bedroom has its own shower with hot water and toilet, facing rice paddies and soon, a pool, of which when we came was still ongoing construction, but the tradies were well managed and didn't bother us at all, greatly appreciated. The other bedroom that has 2 separate beds is generously spaced with a simple dining table. All beds are pretty much comfortable to sleep on.  The outside kitchen and big dining table are also thoughtfully provided but we never used it as the owner catered us with an option of an in-house chef who cooked for us with delicious Balinese meals made to order.  This is really thoughtful as staying in a holiday home in a location like this, all you want is to enjoy the view, scenery and surrounding tourism spots and so having your needs and meals taken care of really made your holiday worthy and enjoyable.  The highlight of tourism spot we loved during our stay is the famous Sekumpul Waterfall, which is only a 20 minutes drive away from Kubu Astina.  It is a magical place, not only 1 waterfall, there are 3 magnificent waterfalls.  Yes, it takes an effort to walk down and up to this waterfalls, but we loved every single part of the guided journey and so did our sister and brother in laws who is in their 60s :-).  Amazing.  We stayed at Kubu for 4 nights and had marvelous time of visiting Sekumpul Waterfall, Singaraja city and Banjar hotspring, Lovina beach (about less thn 1-hour-drive), Mimpi Menjangan, about 2 hrs drive and 1/2 hour boat ride for snorkelling at Menjangan island and the beautiful diving-snorkelling sites of Amed-Tulamben-Jemeluk (about 1.5 hrs drive).
This lovely holiday home we heard is the only one in Sawan village, and we believed with the pool completed months away, we must come back.  We simply loved it even without the pool, and with that add on, wow, a definite return.  We love the serenity and peaceful of this place, and every morning and night time we were always serenaded by Balinese traditional music of Grantang played by Pak Pasek, beautiful. Our 2 teenagers of 11 and 16 didn't feel boredom at all and enjoyed so much staying here as well learned so much that they shared the cultures and this experience with their school friends back in Sydney.  Thank you to the owner and the staff of Kubu Astina so much for this wonderful stay and unforgettable memory.  We would definitely return and highly recommend this holiday home to anyone who would like to have wonderful holiday like we had. One more time, let us say, SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL.","This is fantastic location for people that want to leave hectic life behind for a few days. The view of the green rice fields brings peace and happiness. Ideal for chilling out or hiking in the rice fields. Old temple and little village on walking distance. Ocean (black sand beach) on 20 min drive.
The B&B is very clean and good managed. Good breakfast and supplementary cooking possible. I will be back there again."
