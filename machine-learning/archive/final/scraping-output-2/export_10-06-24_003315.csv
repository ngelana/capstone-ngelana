An exceptionally warm family runs this small and charming caf√© on the way to the beach. If you want to experience authentic hospitality in Balian, you must visit here!

Also very nice spot to rent some good surfboards, Mate is painting some boards with his own design which makes it even more special.

Our 1-year-old son had a outstanding time with the family and their children.

Must-do in Balian!

Keep it up, Putu and Mate!
GECKO ;)","We can organise for party, cooking together at night. Having breakfast the next morning with smoothie and good coffee. Thank you Made, I enjoyed my time. I'll come again on my holiday.","My absolute favourite spot in Balian. The coffee & food was really amazing (best coffee in the area) but what really makes this place special is the relaxed, friendly atmosphere - Made & his beautiful family really make you feel at home here. And then there‚Äôs the late drinks & music (Bintangs all round) - A proper home from home. I will defo be coming back to see everyone next year üòä."

Not only noodles/rice but also pancakes and very good omelette (with cheese!). Fresh mango juice - the best I tried in this village. Good atmosphere - nothing special but better than a typical warung.","I‚Äôve been bartering nearby and this was my place of choice to have lunch every single day of the week, and sometimes dinner too.

We arrived very late and were greeted with the most welcoming smile by their trusted driver Mano.  Sending Mano a picture made it easier for him to spot us as there are a lot of people getting picked up at the airport.

Putu Nova is a wonderful host and her Husband Made is a great guy that also does airport transfers.

The food in the restaurant is good and well priced.  A bit further to the beach than some of the other accommodation but this is reflected in the lower price.","I stayed here with 3 mates for 4 days and we all absolutely loved this homestay. Made and putu are absolute legends very lovely family too ,very affordable place to stay . The food is very tasty and there's no shortage of bintang. Also you can hire scooters for a very good price to zip down to the beach or explore balian which is a beautiful part of the country. Very relaxing at bintang balian I will definitely be back one day .","Anywhere that has a monkey chained to a tree, with no water and bad hygiene deserves 1 star. Please give her to a rescue centre, she needs to be with other monkeys as they are social animals. Not stuck on her own!","Loved my stay, very hospitable & friendly, just like staying with family, clean, affordable & great food, close to beach, highly recommended.."
