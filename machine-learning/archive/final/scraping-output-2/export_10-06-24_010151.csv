20 minutes drive from the center and 40 minutes from Ngurah Rai Int'l airport.
During the school holiday me and my little fam decided to spend a couple of days on denpasar. My daughter visit this place every day even in the evening with her grandpa. The place consist of restaurant and nature view, even for country side this place very quiet.many locals go for walks, and buy some food closes to this place.
Beside of Uma palak rest area also available mini zoo and the owner allow to enter for free My daughter and son was so happy. Hope in another day this place is grew up. Thanks",Nice view,,

Rooms are nice and clean.
But no room service and staff do not speak English so it’s a problem for non Indonesian speakers.
Hotel is close to the main road so loud noise of the scooters keep coming for 24 hours and becomes too noisy too sleep at night.
They do not provide drinking water.","they wrote on bookingcom for 5$ or 77k rupiah. but once i touched down there, they said the owner increasing the price to 10$ or 150k which means 2x as written. still no breakfast, no shampoo, no toothpaste. luckily the room was clean enough but too noisy because on the main road","Okay, I just check-in today and the room condition is SHOCKING! There is a mold everywhere (wall, ceiling), no showerhead,  thick dust at table and headboard. I can understand they only provide 1 towel, no hot shower, and poor wifi for the budget, but this is too much. I complain to front office and his answer even more shocking: we prepare our last room especially for you. Especially!? What an irony....
Coz I keep complaining due to my sinusitis condition, he promise to change my room to a proper room is somebody check out tomorrow. Meanwhile I need to sleep with mask on",Economic price but very clean,ggsi

They got good spot next to fried chicken joint, good choice.

Typical of Indonesian, small parking area, specially for car. But I think this area was design to park your car at the side road. Anyway no problem with this thing.

Outlet appearances using modern mininalism with concrete exposed design. Like todays trend. They have a good window design that can change shape into table, innovations in this area. Cozy vibes and warm lighting make the rainy season feel good inside this coffee joint.

Super good customer services, humble owner, I can't say the staff is humble or not because I don't know which one they are. Coffee taste so so that day, the special thing doesn't come out yet, I'm waiting for their signature coffee drink and coffee blend, one day I will try it.

Not a good spot for working but you got a feelin to spend the rest of your day with your friends there. Separated smoking area, I do really love people who separated smoker and non smoker. Just in case you should sip your caffeine with tour kids, you don't need to worry to much.

Cause it's still new so need much more fix and match, but this place got a good thing to visit and enjoy",best affordable coffee place in BALI! 5 Star for the price! and the taste! you will served by the owner himself! i go everyday if i'm in Bali.. super comfy!,"One of best coffee in town!  Great technique manual brew by their baristas as they just won a manual brew competition recently!  Another thing to notice is gheir house blend of coffee,  so creamy and caramelized with a smooth fibish after taste! Definitely will come back here again!  Cheers","What an experience! A concept bar that allows you to have a convo over coffee and all! Amazing coffee and very cheerful staff. They have various single origins to try from local farm to international. Cheap price, cozy place! Its a must visit coffee shop in Denpasar!",One of recommended coffee shop in Peguyangan! Good taste of coffee and friendly barista👍🏼🙌🏻
