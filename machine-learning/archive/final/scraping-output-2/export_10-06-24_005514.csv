The staff were wonderful and very accommodating. I loved the seamless process, from booking via WhatsApp to room service, breakfast confirmation, and taxi bookings. The outdoor area is absolutely breathtaking, featuring a charming swimming pool with a great view. The food was decent as well. Overall, I was very impressed. The price and the accommodation were perfectly aligned.","Rumah Kayu Resort is an excellent choice for those seeking relaxation just a short distance from Ubud's busy center. Its location, outside the heart of Ubud, has its pros and cons - we absolutely loved it because it allowed us to truly disconnect from the city's kind of chaotic atmosphere and enjoy a peaceful, relaxing stay. The breakfast is also absolutely delicious - definitely one of the highlights of our stay. I hope I can come back one day.","The rooms and service were very good and clean. The place itself is beautiful and relaxing! It is not a high class place as I expected but still it‚Äôs highly recommended for hiking and relaxing. There are also some activities around and organized by the hotel. Even a free yoga class plus great massages!
It was a deception spotting a sad parrot kept in a cage all day long at the reception. I don‚Äôt see a point for that at all place that has a restaurant with a while vegan menu.","We loved our stay there! Beautiful garden that surrounds all villas in the resort, nice decor and amenities, service was faultless and friendly. The view from the restaurant and pool is enchanting in the early morning especially! Good free yoga session and convenient free shuttle to Ubud town centre.","The manager Kompiang Oka was friendly, welcoming and interesting to talk to. The living space is great too. Attached is the Brunch and Lunch menu for their restaurant"

My partner and I stayed in the deluxe room on the ground floor which we loved. Heaps of space and a nice amount of natural light into the room. The pool was great and always at a perfect temperature. We only had breakfast while here but it was super yummy and presented beautifully. All the staff were super friendly and accommodating with our requests, the shuttle that the villa also supplied was awesome and super handy for the times that it ran. 100% will come back again and will recommend to family and friends.","Lovely hotel far from Ubud city hustle. We booked private pool villa. Amazing view from Villa. Staff is very nice. The property is 30 minutes drive from Ubud Palace but they do provide free shuttle 3 times a day. Food is good but bit expensive, however if you want to relax then better order food in hotel. Floating breakfast in villa was an amazing experience.","AVOID! HORRIBLE HONEYMOON EXPERIENCE! This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúoh they are mad so they left a bad review‚Äù post; this is an honest review. We stayed in the luxury villa with a private pool which is beautiful, no complaints.

The first day we ordered breakfast, I cut into my omelette and there was a ROACH cooked into my omelette! They cook food outside and serve it; the presentation is beautiful but VERY UNSANITARY. They gave us a free massage to apologize, just terrible. We couldn‚Äôt even enjoy the candle lit dinner or floating breakfast that came with our honeymoon package because we DID NOT TRUST THE FOOD SERVICE. We got them anyway, took photos, then ordered food delivery instead.

Also, this hotel constantly loses electricity and the hot water stopped working multiple times throughout our 4 day stay (at least once per day). The staff will fix it but it‚Äôs very annoying having to constantly call the front desk. PLEASE STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE IF YOU HAVE THE OPTION.","We stayed at this villa in Ubud, bali. We enjoyed the service and the hospitality but the cleaning was bad‚Ä¶the exteriors were very dirty‚Ä¶they wouldn‚Äôt take care of the insects as other place ive been to in bali‚Ä¶also the beadsheets weren‚Äôt looking or feeling very clean or hygienec, the breakfast was also not good‚Ä¶less options to choose on‚Ä¶and the location was HORRIBLE!!! there wasn‚Äôt anything near by to do, or eat‚Ä¶wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying her.","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Villa Kayu Lama and I am excited to share my positive experience. From the moment we arrived, the staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. They were incredibly accommodating, taking care of all our requests with a smile and even providing recommendations for local attractions and restaurants.

The villa itself was  clean. The swimming pool was a standout feature, and it was evident that the staff took great care in maintaining it as it was regularly cleaned and inviting throughout our entire stay.The location behind is a place for those whom will love nature and not those whom with herpetophobia or entomophobia.

However, it's important to note that this place might not be ideal for those with herpetophobia, as occasional lizard sounds can be heard. Despite this, the staff was understanding and addressed our concerns promptly, ensuring our comfort was a priority.

All in all, Villa Kayu Lama exceeded my expectations, thanks in large part to the exceptional service provided by the staff. Their attentiveness and willingness to go the extra mile made our stay truly memorable. I highly recommend this villa to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable vacation experience."

you feel cared for here. the staff will help with any question and make your vacation unforgettable.

the owners Poul and Uma put their whole soul into this place. Manager Gede is a person who can do anything. understands and helps. I am happy to know this family and live here.

The beauty and special style of the villa cannot be expressed in words. I recommend this place to everyone who wants to experience living in a creative place among nature and enjoy peace and tranquility.
Convenient location near Ubud but in a very quiet place.
cleanliness and comfort. perfect service.
massage on request.
The staff cooks very tasty food. magical beautiful breakfasts and cappuccino. fresh coconuts. You can order delicious lunch and dinner.
thanks for this time here","Great little getaway with my
Mother and Sister. About 20mins away from the town which is perfect as it‚Äôs nice and quiet with a beautiful view of rice paddy‚Äôs and open space.","Me and some friends stayed in this STUNNING villa over new years and wow, from the moment we stepped in, we fell in love with this villa. Everything was super clean, beautifully designed and very very comfortable. The space felt very spacious and open but still cozy! The air cons in the rooms were a huge bonus and the large private pool overlooking the rice paddies and greenery surrounding us was truly magical. What made this villa even more special was the kindness and hospitality of the host Gede and the staff working there. They went above and beyond to make our stay super special. We even organised a home cooked dinner for new years eve and ate it at our villa - they set up the table for us and it was really pretty! One thing to note is that it takes about 30 minutes to get to ubud centre but we didn't mind because it definitely felt more peaceful being away from the busyness of ubud. The best way to make your way into town would be scooter rental or just use grab (very cheap taxi service). I highly recommend this villa and would definitely stay there again.","A perfect Villa for your calm Ubud holiday!
It‚Äòs a bit out of Ubud but still reachable, nice parking availability, if you drive a car, try to rent a small car, so you don‚Äòt have a problem to drive trough the small road to the Villa :D
Gede was a very nice and helpful guy!
The Villa is huge, the outdoor living room is stunning, you can jump from the sofa directly in to the poolüòÅ
The pool is just amazing, with a great view to the rice fields
The breakfast was great, you get everything you need
This place is insane!
We are coming back :)","The villa is very beautiful, neatly maintained and so picturesque. Although it is not located very close to ubud so traveling to and fro Ubud takes about 20-30 mins."
