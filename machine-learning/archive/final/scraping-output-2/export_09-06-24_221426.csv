Yum ‚ò∫Ô∏è,"The ambiente is impressive. I had the impression like entering a botanical garden. Flowers and green all over. Tables and benches on hidden places. Lovely.

The food was great looking, the taste was a bit disapointing. The very first time in Bali that I had to add spices. The same for the juices, not really tasty and small. But the dessert was great.

A shop for Bali souveniers in high quality for reasonable prices is also included.

It's a place made for foreign tourists, presenting them the paradise athmosphere of Bali.","The best! Organic, healthy, vegan High quality comfort food! I loved it so Much! Stone oven glutenfree pizza and delicious fried noodles! Fun to try the tropical pizza with fruits and cinnamon! So Good! Sweetest staff and delivery take away option. Thank you!

The spa services were incredible, and the restaurant dishes out some incredible food as well. The dishes varied from western to Indonesian menu items. I only ordered indonesian options and they were all quite nice and appropriately seasoned and spiced (I'm Indonesian fyi).

I would come by for a longer visit without a doubt.",We were honored to spend time here !!!!   So so beautiful.....   BEST spot.....   amazing people.....   so clean....so safe....   fantastic buffets !!!!,"Gaia is a gem. A piece of heaven on earth.
We stayed at Abasan (mountain) and Patai (ocean) and loved both experiences.

I can highly recommend this resort to stay or run a retreat.

The staff is super friendly.
The food delicious.

‚Ä¶ and they might not tell you but this resort supports many ngos, has a massive positive impact on Bali.

I cannot wait to be back as this place has stolen a piece of my heart","Staying here has truly been a breathtaking and transformative experience. I truly feel changed for the better and I am only half way thru my time here. The staff tends to you like divine family, the spirituality and prayers here are healing. I have never been taken care of like I have here. Any concerns are addressed immediately. Plus, the foundation does incredible work. Thank you for my time and transformation here. I will visit again and again. üôè‚ú®üåäüåÖ","The resort and staff is so kind, conscious, and tender. Hearts are full, open, strong, and clear. Body is nourished, mind is relaxed, soul is connected. Ms. Putu and Eta provided such a divine stay. The island of the gods as Yen would say. I felt so held and healed here. All of the departments had their specialty and did a spectacular job no matter what the need was. Any time there was a challenge it was cleared up quickly. I feel so grateful to have had the honor of staying here. I cannot wait to come back, home."

We recommend this hotel!","Such a lovely place and excellent value for money. We love Tejakula and Villa Aditya is right next to the beach in a gorgeous garden. Rooms are well equipped, staff are lovely and breakfasts are great.","Beautiful place run by local people, very friendly, available, attentive and smiling. Beautiful gardens and facilities, very close to the beach. The rooms are very spacious, bright and air-conditioned with a large terrace with dining area and lounge chair. Large kitchen equipped with the basics but with drinking water dispenser and fridge (important for ice cold beers). You also have a hot shower (who wants a hot shower in Indonesia?). The room is cleaned daily. You can have breakfast on your terrace or in the dining room overlooking the sea, I highly recommend this one because it is plentiful, made with local products and very good value for money compared to other places nearby. Spa and restaurants nearby for lunch and dinner. Supermarkets and ATM within 20 minutes walk.
You can also do yoga in a specially designed place as well as massages. They organized all our trips and departure from the place with driver with perfect English . There is also the important detail of providing you with repellent for the body and for the rooms because of the mosquitoes (it is in the middle of the jungle and it is Indonesian) and a big umbrella for your use in case of rain. For the service and value for money I absolutely recommend it.","Made and team are all very helpful. If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet getaway, here is perfect. You can rent a scooter straight from Made for a reasonable price, rooms cleaned everyday. The nearby restaurants Warung seni and Warung made are delicious and have enough options to go to multiple times. Everyone there is very friendly. The beach is literally 30 seconds walk from my room. You can hear the waves from your outside daybed.
Highly recommend","I enjoyed my stay here.
It is very quiet.
There isn‚Äôt much in the area so I would recommend to go to the next door warung: Warung Seni for your meals.
It is a perfect place to chill, hang by the pool and do some yoga (self-practice).
You can walk straight to the beach (peddles not sand)"

Mega keeps this lovely homely property immaculately clean and real credit to her, her father and family for creating this wonderful accommodation. The attention to detail is second to none. A more peaceful and relaxing time you will not find even in the best places in Bali. Did I mention the access to the beach? You step out of the gardens, through a wonderful gateway and you are on manicured lawns covered in palms right to the sea. Mega (father) is a creative artist who has worked hard to help make this property an idyllic sanctuary.

The owner Wayan is so nice and considerate. If you are a person who never want to leave this ridiculously luxurious villa (which we are not) you won't have to.
