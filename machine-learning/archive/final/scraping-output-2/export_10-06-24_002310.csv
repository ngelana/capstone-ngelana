I had tempeh manis and my wife chicken Ayam be tu tu.

Both amazing. We also had perfect pancakes with coconut and fried banana.

And those fruit fresh pressed juices! Just splendid!

Owner is really kind, especially to our kids, he even gave our daughter small kids.","This place looks simple and humble but the food and flavour is anything but! Came here because of the glowing reviews - all I will say is, believe the hype!

So good to find a Warung with a separate veggie/vegan friendly menu and the owners get it!

We asked for our food to be spicy and they were really surprised because a lot of tourists don‚Äôt like spicy food. The lady went across the field and picked a handful of  chilli‚Äôs straight from the plant!

Eyes rolling back and drooling‚Ä¶ best food I‚Äôve had. Thanks!!!! ü§§","Terrific tasting food, as good as any we have had in Bali. Very reasonably priced family Warung in Sideman with a nice outlook over the fields and friendly staff. Well worth the stop.","What an amazing place! Local food, quiet place with a awesome vieuw to the rice fields of Sidemen. Getting there by the most beautiful ways to ride with the scooter that i've ever did. Friendly waiter, and very good food. You can do a walk through the fields nearby without tourists (yes, you still can say that in Bali). We enjoyed a lot the lunch!","Wow! I came here twice during my stay in Sidemen and the food was incredible each time.
Beautiful views, really good prices, and genuine, lovely owners! They knew I was leaving the next morning so they packed me a little snack for the drive.ü•πüôèüèº
I had the tempeh manis (they can make it a bit spicy too‚Äì soooo good)

The food is really good and the staff very friendly. The fruits juices are really fresh. I really recommend to you to do a break there if you're around !
There is a nice pool too open for the customers.
I spent hours there and I think It will be one of my best memory in Bali.","Pretty much in line with what other reviewers reported. Great, clean little hideaway with million dollar views, a chill vibe and a super nice server. I had the pad Thai and it was quite good, but unfortunately it only had about 3 tiny shrimp it that were the size of half my pinky fingernail :( I mentioned it to Adi and he said it‚Äôs difficult to get shrimp here because they‚Äôre so far inland. I suggested they simply offer it with chicken instead, which is clearly in no short supply. Will go back, and with my swimsuit next time!","Best spot after the rice terraces trek on a hot day! I loved it here so much I came back again to enjoy the pool and the lovely food and drink. Highly recommend this beautiful pool with a view, you can use the pool if you‚Äôre a paying customer and the food is so affordable üòä very relaxing!",Amazing place to take a dip in the pool and have a meal.

The food at the property is very good if you do not want to get out. The staff is so kind and drive me to some places as I couldn‚Äôt drive scooter myself.
The room is fantastic, all in wood, I was just front of the pool. I didn‚Äôt want to leave!","what we liked
we preferred the wooden cottages, they are beautiful,
there are only 2
very comfy large beds, medium soft mattress,  cotton sheets
beautiful garden and pool
no mosquitos
the aircon worked well.

what we did not like so much
uncomfortable outdoor chairs to dream away with a book for a few hours
no view other then the garden (no rice fields)
no mini bar to keep our drinks cold
the food was rather bland
noise from scooters and farmer machinery during day time
i feel almost ashamed to write this as the people working here are very helpful and friendly.

conclusion: for us it was good for 2 nights and a rental scooter to explore the environment.","If you want a place that's quiet and nice then that's the place for you.
The room's are quite big and the garden & pool is nice.
We enjoyed the view from the pool very much.
The Staff is really nice and very helpful. You can ask for a activities like a private yoga class, massages or taxi service and they will arrange that for you.
You'll get breakfast there and have the option to get lunch and dinner as well.
You can pay with Tap (contactless), I used a visa card without any problems.

It was really nice staying there.",We loved this place; beautifully decorated with a large pond and pool. Stayed in one of the two hillside villas which had a nice view and was very comfortable. Staff was lovely and the lunch and dinner we had were some of the best food we had in Bali!

Such amazing service. They have an amazing deal where you can get a 1hr massage and lunch or dinner for 150k idr. The massage was easily the best Ive had my entire time in Bali.

The food is wonderful and amazing. I read many great reviews prior to coming to Bali and they are all true. My last night here in sidemen I opted to do the cooking class and it was such a memorable evening.

Please come in and support this wonderful family. ‚ù§Ô∏è",Just had a great massage and a wonderful Indonesian dinner . The staff is super friendly. They gave us a free ride back to our hotel because they said it was too far to walk. Great service. Definitely worth a visit when you‚Äôre in Sidemen.,"Massage and dinner deal for 150k is so sick. The view is amazing, the massage was great, as was the food. I had the vegetable soup and tuna. Would absolutely do it all again.","Great service, lovely staff (family run) and food was delicious. Very affordable compared to what‚Äôs around. Got a massage + lunch package for only 150K and the massage was really relaxing. Highly recommended!","We had a lovely and delicious meal, the curry and grilled tuna.
The day after we took their cooking class. We made 7 different recipes. Is was a really fun and authentic experience. We learned a lot and it was all very delicious and traditional food. Afterwards we gained all the recipes so we can make it at home.

A family of 6 from Australia. We had an absolutely lovely time staying in this nice villa. The rooms are comfortable and outdoor pool has a great view. The best thing is to spend time with the family running the villa. We enjoyed meeting Ayu and her kids and the grandparents. All the staff extremely friendly and helpful.

Very helpful, friendly and welcoming! Cleaned the room everyday too with complimentary tea and coffee. Thank you for a great stay üôèüèΩ","Enjoyed our stay here. First impressions are that it's a work in progress but there was no noise nuisance and it will be lovely when it's finished.

The room/bungalow was spacious and comfortable with a beautiful bathroom.  Unfortunately the fridge didn't work and wasn't fixed/replaced even though we mentioned it. As expected,  there is no air con. It was quite warm, and some people could be uncomfortable with just a fan.

Restaurants are a short scooter ride away (or an uphill walk). We were able to hire a scooter on site.

I did the ""cooking class"" but probably wouldn't recommend it.

A good stay and I'd return.","The rooms were nice. Only a fan available and the room for SUPER hot but the bed was nice with a great mosquito net. The only issue we really had was that the shower was like an open floor with 2 tiles and rocks around; usually this is no problem but the first shower I had (fortunately I was in slides) there was a leech slithering across my shoe. I would recommend being very prudent in these showers, fortunately we had our resident frog and gecko around to eat them but just be careful here. The owners are VERY nice and you can rent a motorcycle for just 100k a day (unfortunately the bike we were given had no fuel and we immediately had to get some).","We stayed at the loka amertha for 5 nights and absolutely loved it.

The homestay itself is surrounded by nature and the rooms are clean and beautiful.

Dodi, his cousin and his wife make sure that it's a really pleasant experience. They are all such happy and welcoming people.

We also took a silversmith class, which Dodi organized for us, and a cooking class with Dodi and Nga. Both of them were so much fun. The cooking class is in the traditional kitchen of the house and Dodi explained a lot about the balinese culture, religion and way of life.

We really loved the homestay and especially the great people leading it.

We definitely recommend it and would come back here anytime.

Thank you so much for the great stay","Very very nice experience! The room is simple as it should be expected. There were a couple of frogs entering but no big deal at all, Dodi took care of it :) this is especially because the bathroom is open in the back, but you have warm water and everything you need. The service was amazing. We wanted a rice field trekking and Dodi was not available, so he called a friend of his extremely kind with which we had amazing time. I think he is always the replacement guy when Dodi is busy. The biggest highlight was the cooking class with Dodi and his cousin (and his 2 little girls). They changed the menu cause we had a couple of special requests but I am sure also the original one would have been the same great. It was amazing!! They explained us what to do step by step and in the meantime we were talking about cultural topics that they explained us in detail. Then we had dinner separately and everything was very very delicious. It was the best typical, original Balinese dinner we have had in our whole trip."
