I really enjoyed his availability, his advice for cooking Indonesian food and him bringing us to places. The rest of the team is very nice and professional as well, and the massages are great. Loved it.","We completed the morning cooking class including a visit to the market to buy the produce, and what an amazing experience!
Santika, who is a skilled chef was also an amazing host from staff to finish, even catering to my dietary needs. We cooked about 5 or 6 authentic Indonesian dishes and they were all so incredibly tasty! This was one of the highlights of our recent stay in Bali! You will also leave with a recipe book to recreate when back home - thank you for the authentic and heartfelt experience!","Luxury rooms, a bit outside central Ubud, perfect if you want to have a couple of calm days!
The very best was the food at the restaurant, simply the best food I‚Äôve had during my 5 weeks ‚Äòstay in Bali!
I can highly recommend to take the cooking course together with the chef of the restaurant/hotelmanager. His enthusiasm for cooking and explaining local culture and cuisine is nothing short of amazing to experience! The pool was nice and clean and there was a possibility to rent a scooter.","MUST TRY IGA BABI (pork ribs) cooked by Chef Santika! Had the best food and accommodation here! Wrapped up my 10 days Indo trip with Pesantian and appreciate the hospitality of Chef Santika and his family.

Bonus: they have two adorable doggos (Mia and Tina) to keep you company hehe","BEST stay in Ubud! We highly recommend to sleep and eat here. Take the suite room, it has a private spacious balcony and the room is amazing. We were planning to stay only a few nights, but we enjoyed this place so much that we extended for days.

Santika (manager) and his team make you feel like home. They are super warm and friendly people and their service is excellent. Everything is very well arranged, the rooms are designed with charme, extremely comfortable and clean.

The accommodation includes a Warung with high quality food (they also offer cooking classes). The area is perfect: calm vibes, in between the rice fields and local lifestyle. A drive to the centre only takes 15 minutes.

Thank you Santika and team for taking care of us! We won‚Äôt forget :)"

You really can't beat this location, just far enough away from Ubud's bustle, with soothing river sounds - jungle leaf melodies and rice fields so close you could lick them, truly enchanting (and bit cooler temperature, which I loved.)  The staff are beyond helpful and extremely easy to work with for anything I have needed help with, cooking amazing meals, to transportation, to booking a great massage therapist to come to the villa, to handling my laundry, brining fresh flowers.. always a very smooth and enjoyable experience.  The surrounding villagers are so nice too, always exchanging big smiles as I walked along the little roads exploring the area.  The pool is EPIC.. with a proper deep end and long enough to swim laps.

I was able to have a deep detox during part of my stay, with a yoga instructor coming in the mornings, afternoon swims & fresh, clean food cooked every day, & sunset to rock your mind..it has been a serious life upgrade staying here!!! Highly recommended!

Thank you Villa Rossi.. You will always have a special place in my ‚ù§Ô∏è.","Peaceful oasis, stunning rice paddy views, tasteful and thoughtful design. Great spot if you are looking to get away from the tourism overload in central Ubud. Still plenty close for exploring northern Bali and Ubud. We loved our one week stay. Nearby Pesantian restaurant is a great resource for dinner with a thoughtful and welcoming chef.","Stayed in for 3 days and it was superrr beautiful and worth it! Peaceful surroundings, clean area, perfect living room to chill. Definitely will recommend this place to others‚ù§Ô∏è",OMG! What a find. This place was awesome,Wonderful place  üòç‚ù§
