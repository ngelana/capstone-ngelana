Loved it so much, although there were many litters.","Beautiful black sand beach. Walk a bit down south from the pin on google maps, for about 10-15 minutes, and the beach will be mostly empty! Be careful when swimming, the waves hit hard on this beach!

4 stars because there's a lot of trash scattered about.","One of the best long Black sand beach with strong wave (check Tide Table & weather apps before visit)

1. recommended for morning visit, easy to reach via Gojek, but to leave with Gojek, you need to avoid local taxi mafia by leaving till the main road junction, beyond the paddy field (not ideal for sunset / night travel)
2. beach is clean, if not overlap with weekends or festival crowd, so, no complain if you visit during non-peak season morning with no crowd.
3. not recommend for swim alone as no safe guard, you are dealing with Pacific Ocean waves and under current.","The ride here from Ubud was really nice, I rode a scooter here to catch the sunrise. It is a black sand beach and it was not crowded at all, I only saw a few scattered folk taking a walk.","So sad to see all the rubbish piles on this beautiful beach.
Nearly stepped on a needle while walking. Obviously, Indonesia has a rubbish problem, and I hope the government implements something to protect its waterways and beaches."

The fitness facilities are so great also with the best trainers. We had the most beautiful time relaxing by the pools and indulging in treatments - everything was 10/10.","Fabulous Resort with absolutely everything you need. We were here for a business retreat and had the whole resort booked out. Excellent services and the location was quiet, serene and right on the beach. It had everything we needed to disconnect from the World and re-connect with ourselves. Staff were excellent and so friendly.  We fell in love with this place.
Food was delicious and so wonderful.
Highly recommend.",beautiful hotel and very family-friendly. World class waves for surfing steps from your hotel room and a really good daily yoga and fitness classes for those of us who don’t surf. The kids club is epic - my 3 yo daughter spent hours there every day. Amazing staff and service. Loved the healthy food at the Health Hub.  We will definitely be back. The only two things I would change: 1) more water stations around the hotel to more easily access drinking water.  You can only get free filtered water at the two restaurants aside from the 2 small bottles they leave in your bathroom. 2) the beach club pool and ocean view room pools seem to be heated to upwards of 40C and are not refreshing to swim in. I wish they would not heat the pools.,"We spent a fantastic five days at Komune on a yoga retreat. The staff were super friendly and welcoming, and the facilities were amazing. The Health Hub had everything you would need for a wellness getaway - superb food from an extensive menu (lots of vegetarian and vegan options), a 25m adults only lap pool with cabanas, and a full fitted out gym room and shala space. Don’t miss out on the massages when you come here either. Bliss. I would highly recommend the tranquility of Komune to anyone looking to relax and unwind in beautiful surroundings for a few days.",Fantastic is an understatement. From the moment we entered the hotel the staff were so helpful and very polite. We got a poolside beach view room on the second floor which is well worth the money. Food was brilliant and well priced. Great to be welcomed every meal time by myself and my son’s name. I can’t recommend this hotel enough. Will definitely be back.

My friend's had the noodles and Sandwich + Watermelon  Juice Alcohol is also served here. Price was not that expensive

The ground floor is airy and you have the rice Field view.

Airplane is air conditioned but we sat down stairs as it was cooler temperature. Food was very average, and the cocktail wasn’t that good either. Kids enjoyed running around on the open lawn and the plane though.","Place :
I like the concept they have with the plane! And also their location is just perfect. Easy access, has huge green yard, has sea view and ricefield, lots of wind and so nice to eat there (not inside of plane -tbh it’s warm there - but outside of the plane). And you can take picture freely!

Staff :
They are friendly and helpful :)

Food & Drink :
They were amazing! They have western and asian food. Also they have kid snacks. You all must try!

Price :
Price is ok. Not expensive in my opinion. If I’m not mistaken, it starts from 65k for main course.

Hope this helps guys!","Nice place beautiful green grass meadow and rice fields view. Resto room under the real airplane B-737/400 monument.

Foods were good tastes, especially Bebek bakar or Bebek betutu.","Beautiful aircraft to sit in and dine, just abit hot and stuffy there if not u can choose to sit below in the restaurant over looking the nice rice field.

The immaculately clean surroundings and charming garden add to the allure. The staff, with their pleasant demeanor, further elevate the experience, ensuring every moment feels special.

What sets Sababay apart is its intimate atmosphere, creating a sense of exclusivity and privacy perfect for those seeking a quiet retreat. Despite its popularity, the winery maintains an air of exclusiveness, welcoming only small groups at a time. The wine tour proves to be both insightful and engaging, offering a deeper understanding of the winemaking process and the history behind the brand. Herdian was very knowledgable and Eka was so cheerful! The service here is top notch.

Of course, no visit is complete without indulging in the generous wine tasting session. Here, guests are treated to a selection of Sababay wines, each sip revealing the dedication and craftsmanship behind every bottle. Despite having explored Bali countless times, stumbling upon Sababay was a revelation. It's a hidden gem that deserves to be shared, and I can't wait to spread the word to all my friends.","My very first time in Bali and my first stop was this winery. The garden was beautiful. It was clear and sunny so my spot stayed shaded with fans blowing behind me. It was comfy and nice.

Herdian was very helpful, he recommended drinks according to my taste. He was very attentive and supported my photo-taking as well!",Did not do the wine tasting but wanted to get a bottle. They were able to give us a small sample taste before we decide. The Black Velvet Cabernet was good for the price. Able to order small appetizers (samosa and chicken wings - good) to go with our bottle which we drank half and took the rest to go. Good experience. Did not pay to do the tour so not seen where the vineyard or distillery.,"Sababay Winery is an absolute gem in Bali! Their wines are simply amazing, each sip transporting you to a world of rich flavors and exquisite craftsmanship. The staff here are not only knowledgeable but also incredibly welcoming and friendly, adding to the overall delightful experience. Whether you're a wine enthusiast or simply looking to enjoy a relaxing day in beautiful surroundings, Sababay Winery is a must-visit destination. Cheers to unforgettable moments and impeccable wines!","We visited and had a tour inside this famous winery in bali. A very good experience to know the making of wine and the history behind this winery. After the tour, we had wine tasting in their  sophisticated garden. The grapes were from local produce, collected by the local farmers for the wine making. The fried casava was eventually the best among all on the table."

We were in a 4-bedroom villa at the end of a street near the spa which we utilized practically every day. The staff is very friendly and would check up on us multiple times a day to ensure we had fresh linen, sheets, and a clean space.  Their selection of tours is great (private car and driver included) and the atmosphere is not bad. Rooms were always clean, beds made, and the white canopy is an excellent touch. The restaurant for lunch/dinner had a good selection and the complimentary breakfast buffet had many choices such as vegetarian, Balinese, & western - my favorite was the latte station! There were even some hot Aussie guys to look at while they surf since the dining room overlooks the beach and waves 😏 The location is outside the city so if you’re not looking for a quiet, relaxing, zen space then you’ll want to look elsewhere. There is no ATM or currency conversion on site but there are both at the hotel right next door. We asked them to fill up the pool with flowers for our friend’s birthday and they DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Overall would recommend Desa Swan Villas and their team, but did notice that in certain areas in the villas where small hives and few ants could be found, but it is a tropical island so it happens!","This was an amazing villa. The staff and service were exceptional, and my hat goes off to all the fabulous staff there. They did a great job. I must mention the breakfast as well. It was delicious with many varieties, and definitely worth the money. I will definitely go back.","I recently had the pleasure of staying at this Villa and I must say, it exceeded all of my expectations. The villa was spacious with 2 nice bed room, a spacious living room, clean private pool , and beautifully decorated with all the amenities I could ask for. The service was top-notch, with friendly staff always ready to assist with any request.

The location of Desa Swan Villas was great , just a short walk away from the beach with stunning views of the ocean. I loved being able to easily access the beach and enjoy the sun and surf whenever I wanted.

Overall, I highly recommend this Villa for anyone looking for a relaxing and luxurious beach getaway. I will definitely be returning in the future.","From the moment we arrived, we were blown away by the spacious villa, impeccable cleanliness, and attentive 24/7 customer service. The restaurant's traditional Balinese dishes were delicious, and the black sand beach was stunning. We felt secure and my family was well taken care of. The in-house SPA services were rejuvenating, and the tour packages were fantastic. The staff, facilities, food, and experiences were all phenomenal. We can't wait to return!","Stayed in this Villa for 5 nights and it exceeded all the expectations we had. Villa was huge with a long, clean private pool, surrounded by beatiful tropical trees. Staff was very friendly and answered to messages in a minute 24 hours a day and were able to fulfill all the wishes we had with extreme politeness. Restaurant was a short walking distance away from the villas but you could also get a complimentary driver to drive you there for broad breakfast buffet and delicious dinner with a beautiful scenery and an ocean view. Villas are in a very quiet area a bit far from everything, but you can easily get a driver for a day from the villas if you need one. Would visit this villa again and I highly recommend it to everyone!"

It was extremely quiet which is why I put the atmosphere a little lower, very large and lovely restaurant right on the water so we couldn't understand why it was so quiet, especially after the good food and service.

Prices: 103240 ink. taxes and service.
No worth it at all."

We met the owners too. They are lovely couple. Great location, excellent food, awesome black beach, nice countryside surroundings. Loved everything about this hotel. We stayed for 1 night initially and then came back to the same place after our nusa penida trip.",Amazing place and people. A beautiful scenery around a rice field. Right next to the beach with a surfing spot,"Good place to stay
Best option for surfer
200meters walk to the beach.
The room, resto, pool, yoga shala is build in the middle of rice field.
Good meal menu at the resto.
If you tired with their resto, there is few  others resto near by....
The location is cool as 45Mins drive to Ubud and 40 minuest to Sanur. 30 mins to the shopping mall.....
BEST is SUPER COOL people work here.
I LOVE this place.","The place is nice and comfortable for staycation or holiyay! The view of Keramas beach and the rice field are combined amazingly, especially the sunrise. This place is located by the beach, only 500 meters away so don't be surprised to listen to the loud waves whenever you're there!
Not only the amazing view, it also offers nature vibes which is really mesmerizing you.
The room was quite clean and furnished by a TV, AC, water heater, comfortable beds (for twin rooms). Personally said, they need to add some bathroom stuffs like toothpaste and its brushes for the guests. And the bed cover really needs to be changed into the better one (for me) and the lamps as well needs to be improved.
They have a small pool, too, and sauna (but I didn't know where it was), wifi with no information to get the password, yet the staffs were friendly enough, while the rest is ok.
The price was I personally think a bit expensive for the room (I stay in) it costed IDR 217k (tax included) but my staycation was well-spent.","Our room was very run down. Sheets didn’t fully cover the bed, the door was hard to open and close, bathroom was dirty, no hot water. No restaurant, spa, or wifi like the guest house claims it has. Location was good and price was cheap but the savings weren’t worth the stay so we left early."

Blue Coco is quiet, rooms with private bathroom, has swimming pool, good housekeeping service, local food, and so nice staff willing to help you no matter what you ask for.
As well as you'll find one of best surf spots in Bali, Keramas is on World Surf League Tour!
In addition, they provide surf lessons, has contacts to rent a motorbike, and many more!!
Such a great experience with them!
I'll be back that's for sure 😊","Blue Coco Guest House is a charming, budget-friendly option offering a mix of comfort and convenience. The rooms are clean, airy, and tastefully decorated. The communal areas are inviting, and the location is accessible to local attractions. Staff is attentive and helpful. Great for solo or family travelers.","Good location short walk to beach
Staff are very nice and rooms are great value for what you pay .I will return","The place is much smaller and simpler then we expected from the pictures. It's pretty basic really. Close to the beach with volcanic sand. The beach in unfortunately covered in rubbish. Locals clean it but every tide more comes in.
This place have a small pool. For the price it's good and we are warming up to the place.
Nice restaurant on the beach."

It was entertaining to see the preparation for the pizza, and we could taste the deliciousness in each bite, the grilled fish was also nice!
Could definitely use some music, but we did rock up later in the night so could be that!😂
They also have a nice little shop to buy snacks and other items which was great.","I have lived 7 years in Indonesia, and the time I recently spent at Surf Camp Bali is one of my favorite memories. Hearing the ocean waves and the birds in the trees while looking out at the rice fields was absolutely enchanting. If you are looking for a simple, beautiful location that is rich with nature and with culture, this is your place. The sunrise is beautiful to the east, the sunset is beautiful to the west, the rice fields are gorgeous and peaceful, and enjoying the breeze and waves while dining on the beach is wonderful. The sand on the beach sparkles, and everything about the place feels magical.","Very good food and such good prices!
Delicious. Lovely atmosphere too!","What a gem of a place! Surrounded by ""fancy"" restaurants charging an arm and a leg for what is substandard food, the Keramas surf camp restaurant produces amazing, tasty, affordable food with extremely friendly service (with an amazing view to look out over).","Cute little restaurant and store. Good meals at inexpensive prices, ate here three times.  Prices include tax and service charges. Overlooking rice paddy, Remember to put on mosquito spray, as there is the odd mosquito 🦟."

The location is great, right on the beach with surf breaks in both directions. The food is really good at a fraction of the price of other places. Only downside is that you may be limited by what foods are currently stocked in their kitchen so often the selection can be reduced. That said we kept returning.

The facility is superb, the cleanliness is outstanding, the food (both western and asian) are mouthwateringly tasty. Recommended!","The Keramas Moonlight Villa is gorgeous! You can tell the owners John and Ratna take pride in their property.
The details of the building, the food (get the included breakfast mmm), the staff…everything is wonderful.
You are very short walk to the beach and fun surf. If you are visiting for the World Surf League (WSL) competition, this spot is perfect to stay.
There is even a brewery right next door with delicious beer and food.
I would (and hopefully will) stay here again.","I would give 5 star to keramas moonlight vila , the place itself near keramas beach at gianyar , 2 minutes walk from villa to beach and the room there is spacious also clean and great service ,  humble owner and workers and they have a resto there called shining jewel , u guys should tried lunch menu sc burger and nasigoreng ,cordon bleu , the taste very delicious .
