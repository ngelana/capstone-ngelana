The Balinese cakes are great and the iced lemon tea was very fresh. Prices are reasonable and service was good. Only recommendation would be to tidy up a bit more as some guests had thrown rubbish on the ground and it was not cleaned up by staff.,"We absolutely love this place.
This place offers top-notch service with a smile. The staff were very friendly who made us feel welcomed from the moment we arrived.
The hospitality was exceptional and the food was sooooo good!
Our overall experience was just amazing. We highly recommend this place. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä","We go from Agung to Ubud and saw this warung, stop and glad. Because we get good local food, and pizza üçï
I take nasi goreng local food and margarita pizza üçïü•∞ wife take spaghetti üçù
Also very nice beautiful view to rice terrace ü§©","Hidden service fee and tax fee, those are additionaly added to the price but not visible anywhere on the menu price list. That is not the practice of other restaurants on Bali that we visited. Laklak (green balinase cake) had burnt taste (we could not eat it). Otherwise the place has potential since surrounding is very nice",Simply amazing traditional food. Priced right. We could not fault this place. Whether local or a tourist its a must. Great friendly service. Thank you to all and to Dewa the owner. Bangga tentu saja! Be proud for sure!
