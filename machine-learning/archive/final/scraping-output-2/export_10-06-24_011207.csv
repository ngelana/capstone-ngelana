üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª","We came here on our way back home in December and we were so pleased. The service was good, the staff here were very friendly and happy to look after us even when it's really busy. We noticed that they were also kind to any stray dogs / cats approaching the restaurant which made us feel impressed. What a beautiful soul ! The staff are the üíé in this restaurant.

We loved this place üíñ‚ú®Ô∏è
The food was outstanding with a perfect portion sizes. Everything we had were delicious and fresh. We are particularly recommend the crispy peking duck (nasi tempong bebek peking goreng) !!!  The flavours were spot - on. This is to date the best crispy peking duck of many I have tried both in Bali and outside. Excellent value for money in the heart of Kuta area.  It's easy for us to say that we will come back again.

Just a note - you cannot book to guarantee your table here. You have to join line up to place your order. It can be very busy period during lunch rush hour and summer school holidays but it is worth the line ü´∂","When i heard pink tempong , we are expect it will be nice tempong restaurant with the good service as another Tempong restaurant in Kuta. Do you know what?  Nobody will approach you, you should go direct to the cashier to order. Luckily the food not take too long. Sambal was great but the food was full of salt, yes totally salty! IDK how many kilo they use the salt üòπ no fan, no AC, feeling spicy and hot in the middle of Kuta ü´†","Last meal for our trip in Bali.
Delicious food, great Sambal because it's not so spicy compared to last year when I tried it."

I've always coming here when I am in Bali, always have same order as well (Squid porridge, roasted duck & cakwe) it's so amazing","Like other chinese food restaurant, dont you dare with the portion. It was massive. It would be better if you order 1 menu for two. Like, if you came with 4 person and want to eat porridge (its special menu), just order 2. What about other menu? Same! I once ordered egg with prawn, it came with big plate and enough for 3 people.

this restaurant seems to be 24hrs operation. Sometimes this place used as high table meeting. Many executives went there and did the negotiation, collaboration talk etc.

But overall, since i'm craving for their menus, those not too matter for me.
The price still affordable since hey.. it's in Bali ! ü§©","I used to frequently visit the branch of this restaurant located in Jimbaran. However, on my recent visit with my tourist friends, our experience was ruined by the poor service of some of the waiters and waitresses. Although the food was good, my Peking duck arrived without the sauce, and it took three attempts to get the attention of different waiters to rectify the situation. The staff didn't apologize for their mistake or even smile throughout the ordeal. Despite being crowded, the restaurant didn't feel chaotic, and it seemed that the staff were used to this situation.

Additionally, the restaurant didn't provide parking, and we were directed to a high-cost parking space. When we attempted to complain, our concerns were dismissed.

If you're looking for the best Laota experience, I recommend visiting their branch in Jimbaran/Nusa Dua. They have better space, a more friendly staff, better food, and a proper parking lot."

The villa truly has exceptional staff members who provide excellent service.","Hey, I wanted to share with you my recent experience at the hotel. Unfortunately, it was far from what I expected and left me quite disappointed.

The room they assigned me was a nightmare. It was infested with cockroaches and earthworms, making it extremely unhygienic and distressing. On top of that, there was a water leakage issue that made the living conditions unbearable.

The bathtub was unusable due to water blockage and algae infestation, which was frustrating. And the washbasin's broken taps caused an unintended shower every time I tried to use them, leaving my belongings and me completely soaked.

To add to the frustration, the receptionist was unresponsive. It took them a painful 3 hours to deliver my luggage to the room despite my constant requests, which was unacceptable.

The room lock kept malfunctioning throughout my stay, forcing me to call the engineer three times. It became a hassle every time I had to step out and wait for someone to let me in upon my return, disrupting my plans each time.

Overall, the experience was distressing. It completely fell short of the basic standards of cleanliness, comfort, and service that one would expect from a reputable hotel.

I've requested the hotel to take immediate action to rectify these issues and prevent other guests from facing similar problems. Also, I asked for a refund or compensation for the inconvenience and dissatisfaction caused during my stay.

I truly hope they take this complaint seriously and make necessary improvements to avoid such disappointing experiences for future guests.

I'm eagerly waiting for their response and actions taken to address these concerns.","with beautiful old style building and very large room. all exterior with 5 stars. unfortunately hotel Management and owner have to focus in interior, especially room.

On the downside, the taste of the dishes was, in my experience, rather ordinary. While the food was decent and well-prepared, it didn't leave a lasting impression in terms of flavor or uniqueness. It's a place where you can get a good meal at a low cost, but don't expect any culinary revelations.

The staff and owner were notably kind and attentive, enhancing the overall dining experience. Their friendly service and quick turnaround time ensure that you won't have to wait long to satisfy your hunger, even during peak hours.

One potential downside is that the popularity of Warung Nasi Pecel Bu Tinuk means it's often crowded. Finding a table might require some patience, and the noise level can be a bit high.

In conclusion, Warung Nasi Pecel Bu Tinuk is a budget-friendly option with a vast selection of dishes. While the taste may not be extraordinary, the variety, affordability, and quick service make it a convenient choice for a satisfying meal. Just be prepared for crowds and consider it more for a practical dining experience rather than a culinary adventure.","Food is good, quite tasty, it's a buffet style restaurant that has been here for a long time. The price gets up real quick, so I'm not fond of that. Parking is a lot easier with motorbikes. Oh the fruit juices is tasty as well.",Halal food. They provide fried chicken/duck mix with pecel. They have any kind of the other Indonesian foods. Difficult to get parking for car.,"Good place to have lunch for indonesian food. It has a many options food to picked up in the front of store. Food taste is average, and is not really hygienne because of is semi open food counter with curtain cover behind it. Prices is quite expensive for that kind indonesian food taste and quality they have. We are ordered Nasi Pecel and they don't know how to make a good bumbu pecel sauce."

Located in Kuta with a good parking place. You can fit a lot of scooters and 3-4 cars at their parking spot.
The hospitality from the staff were excellent, the menu is well written with a good visual.

You gotta try the fries with their cheese and level 1 spice. So good! Never forget to go for the spicy chicken. If you are not a good fan of spicy food then just go for level 0-1. If you are medium then go for level 3-4. An expert? Try the 5!

I ordered a lot at this place until my wife got mad at me!","My favorite menu is fire chicken, spacy and tasty. 2 stories. second floor can fit many customers. Parking area not too spacious. I didn't see parking area for cars","Surprisingly good. Not as spicy as people said.

- the atmosphere is just not vibing. They have some decor homework to do. Ice cubes too much on my drink.","Very slow service and place looking abit shabby and lack of maintenance.

I love ayam betutu goreng, for betutu kuah i think its just ok but i most prefer ayam goreng betutu.
For plencing i think the flavour is just ok, nothing special.
But if you like sambal mantah then you should try, the coconut and union, chily was taste balance in harmony..
Once again this is my personal opinion nothing to do with any endorsment just my opinion for my love to eat..
Hope this can help..","We chose fried ayam betutu that came with plecing kangkung, sambal matang & fried peanut. Don't forget to try the beef satay. They tasted very good, you can taste the spice into the bone of the chicken. Also the chilli sambal can't be resisted. The dressing broth also gave more spicy taste for the fried chicken.

The portion is just right for me, in fact i want a second one right away because it's so delicious. If you want to bring home the foods they sell the frozen betutu and sate lilit"
