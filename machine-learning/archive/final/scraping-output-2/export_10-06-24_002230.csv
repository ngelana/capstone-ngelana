The location is very good, 5min by car to Cretya. It's outside of the town just enough so you have a piece and also good distance to all the main attractions.  The restaurant has very good quality food and fair prices. Massages and spa are one of the best there is in Ubud. Rooms are big and clean, but we had a few ants , but for the place like that( jungle almost), what to expect. Staff is very friendly, we had a gecko come into our room and the staff helped us get it out. Just the breakfast wasn't the best , it was okay but nothing special . Would recommend great value.","We really enjoyed our stay here. The pool was lovely and the staff members were extremely friendly.

Our only complaint is, we were under the assumption there wouldn‚Äôt be lots of noisy children running around every day. We picked this spot for more peace and serenity. Many kids were loud around the pool early mornings. Every morning during our breakfast, one child brought this extremely loud toy to the dining area and played the music the entire time. Not just kind of loud- I had a hard time hearing my husband talk across the table. It completely destroyed the peace after we had such a nice yoga session before.

We just wish the staff stepped in to talk with the child‚Äôs parents and say this is not an appropriate place for loud toys.",Hands down the best hotel in Ubud for a peaceful and relaxing stay. Very polite and helpful staff. If you are a vegetarian like me you won't be disappointed by the variety of vegetarian food items they have compared to other hotels for  Breakfast and Afternoon snacks.It is a bit far from Ubud centre but they provide free shuttle service to Ubud market so you can explore Ubud palace and nearby attractions. They also have a inhouse Yoga Centre and Spa so you can enjoy the stay without getting out of the property. The pool overlooks the rice fields which is calm and relaxing. You can spend hours there till sunset which is worth it.,"Great hotel right in the middle of the rice fields. Very quite surrounding and has a wide range of food and drinks. Especially the non alcoholic drinks. Awesome for relaxation.

The rooms are comfortable, clean, and absolutely huge! I really felt like royalty staying here, and was treated as such! They even noticed (I'm guessing from my passport) that it was my birthday on the day I arrived and surprised me with cake and sang happy birthday to me which was so lovely. I visited the spa twice for a full body massage and a coconut cream hair bath and can highly recommend both! I should also mention that they spray the entire hotel for bugs so there are no mosquitos, despite being deep in the jungle and this was a HUGE plus for me - I really felt like I could relax. The weekend was a little slice of heaven and I'm just sorry I didn't get to stay longer. Simply superb! üëèüèº","Very very nice hotel a bit away from the busy city. the rooms are amazing, the food delicious and the staff extremely friendly.
one thing that needs to be improved: the pool are is fully occupied very quickly and we believe that every guest should have a sunbed at the pool if desired.",Absolutely amazing location and surroundings.

This place was so beautiful, and very difficult to maintain. But they did it so well. Keep up the good work team. Even the pool was clean.

They helped us in every possible way.

Food was also good.
And staff was very sweet.

Definitely going to stay again.","We stayed here for 2 nights. This is the best accomodation we ever had when touring Indonesia for 13 days (surabaya, malang, labuan bajo and bali).

What we like:
1. The place offers this feeling of exclusivity. There are only 3 villas here. Peaceful, quiet and away from the buzzing streets and crowds of Ubud.
2. The villa offers authentic Balinese experience where almost everything is made of wood.
3. The staffs are all smiles and always willing the help. They offer free transport to and from their restaurant (Nusandari Cafe) and 2nd madani property.
4. Wifi is good.
5. The villa is located along the road and accessible to grab cars and local motor bikes and taxis.
6. There are great cafes and restaurant nearby (walking diatance) that also offers great food and rice paddy views.
7. Madani is surrounded with rice paddies, local neigborhood that trully bring a balinese experience.
8. The outdoor shower and bath tub is perfect.
9. Pool is perfect for afternoon dip.
10. Their breakfast is delicious and big serving.

What can be improved:
1) The wooden floor and furnitures make creaking sound. Can sound so creepy at night üò±. Also loud enough that you can hear the other villa's creaking sound too.
2) Check-in time is 2pm but we were only able to get in the room almost 3pm. We were very tired from our long flight and car drive so we were really disppointed and too tired to argue. They gave us complimentary smoothies and drink of our choice for the inconvenience.
3. They light incense in the afternoon and place it in front of the villa's steps. It is kinda ok because it is their religion but the scent is sometimes too strong it gives me headache.
4. They can add hooks where we can easily hang our used clothes or provide more hangers on the closet.
5. I hope they can offer unli balinese coffee for their guests.

We will definitely recommend this place to our friends visiting Bali."

We enjoyed sunset there.,"Mesmerizing rice field view at this quiet spot with great drinks and food at a good price. Veggie options too. The staff are lovely. Wasn't busy either time we came.

The drive here is also pretty nice, off the main road and not far from Ubud. And easy parking out front.

We liked it so much we had to come back!","Throughout our visit to Bali this time, we came to this beautiful cafe like 10 times within 2 weeks.
It is super beautiful, cozy, not too busy with easy access to powerpoints with sizeable table, so it is a perfect for anyone who would want to seat relaxingly for a long time. Both the owner and staff are super friendly and patient.

We also wanted to ensure that we order proper amount of food and drink while we use cafe facilities. The price is super reasonable though.
The cheap price doesn't mean that the food quality is average. Believe me, their food quality is soooo good! I wonder how the owner can still make a profit with high quality but super reasonable price.

The only reason that I cannot give (really sadly) 5 stars is that sometimes the local people smoke a lot. Sometimes people vape, and no staff stops them. One day, there were couple of guys who were staying for like half days and continuously heavily smoking. It is a very breezy area, so the whole smoke smell came into the cafe. That ruins entire atmosphere and makes people indoor uncomfortable.
One careful suggestion is to make a smoking zone at the far corner of the outdoor area.

Nevertheless, it is one of my favorite cafes in Bali by farüòÅ thank you for everything and I will definitely come back and recommend your place to friends around.","Lovely view enjoying and cozy, have our meal before starting our day trip.

The rooms were fantastic‚Äîspacious with a minibar that was refilled daily (free of charge) with water, fruit, and Coke. The rooms were cleaned twice a day, both in the morning and evening.

Another highlight was the delicious breakfast. We enjoyed it immensely; you could order a dish from the breakfast menu, along with a coffee and juice of your choice. They also served a croissant and fruit. You could choose to have breakfast in the restaurant or your room, and it was available at any time of the day from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

As a convinced food lover, I really enjoyed the breakfast which was deliciouuus: it is a la carte, you can choose whatever you prefer and beside this, it is included a juice, coffee/tea, croissant with butter and jam and fruits. Simply amazing! In the last day we enjoyed the floating breakfast and it was very nice!
Another experience that we booked was the cooking class which, again, was an incredible and unique experience. We learned A LOT about their traditional food. We started it with a visit to the local market and then continued with the actual cooking class together with the chef which was very nice.
At the end of it, they served us the food in the restaurant and we loved everything!

But I‚Äôm so happy to say that these weren‚Äôt fake reviews!

The rooms are incredibly clean, and even the smallest rooms are extremely spacious. The balcony has a beautiful view of greenery, and the sounds of birds and crickets make you feel truly immersed into the Ubud environment.

What truly sets this resort apart is their customer service. Every single employee was extremely courteous and accommodating. And quite literally, everyone was SO nice, I sorta felt guilty about it! We especially wanted to thank Tira for her kindness and for truly making us feel welcome in her hometown of Ubud!

The only minor thing, is the location is not walkable to ubud center, but they do provide a complimentary shuttle every 2 hours.

If you‚Äôre not too picky about location, and are looking for a nice resort to relax at (and at a reasonable price!), I 100% recommended AnandaDara.","I recently had the pleasure of staying at this hotel, and I must say, the rooms exceeded my expectations. The accommodations were not only spacious and well-designed but also impeccably clean. The attention to detail in the room's decor and amenities truly enhanced my overall comfort during the stay.
However, was the hotel's beautiful pool. The serene ambiance and well-maintained surroundings made it a perfect retreat. Whether for a refreshing swim or simply lounging by the poolside, it added a touch of luxury to the overall experience.

The hotel's restaurant was another standout feature. The dining experience was exceptional, with a diverse menu showcasing culinary excellence.
In conclusion, this hotel goes above and beyond in providing a luxurious and enjoyable experience. From the well-appointed rooms to the stunning pool and delightful dining options, it truly sets a standard for hospitality.

The food is well worth the wait. Really nice family and the food is so fresh and for a great price. We‚Äôve been in Bali for a week and this is the best food we‚Äôve had. Sad that we are leaving the area tomorrow otherwise we would have come here for every remaining meal. 100% recommend eating here!,"So far we have visited several places around Ubud, besides the great food and beverages two things made this place outstanding for us. First the hospitality and  openness of Lena, the owner. We had a long conversation and we felt more than guests. Secondly the opening hours. Quite hard to find any place in Bali where you can eat after 10pm. The are open until guest are there. And the pancakes tastes like my mother‚Äôs!

Highly recommended!","We came for a coffee break and eventually finish with three pelmeni dishes - boiled, fried and pelmeni in a soup. The coffee and all dishes were nice and tasty. Thank you",We had a lovely lunch at Kubera! We immediately felt welcome and the food was delicious. Lena prepared everything fresh and there was a very calming view. We would recommend to come by if you are in the area!,Delicious fresh food for a great price - we had the gado gado and mie goreng. The people there were so friendly and the owner was kind enough to show us his rice fields!

The only problem is that the internet connection is not stable and it makes remote work really challenging.","BEST LODGE ON OUR TRIP AROUND  BALI

This Lodge ist absolutly magnifiscent! The bright rooms and the view in the authentic ricefields are priceless. In addition to that we met the most friendly and polite hosts and staff members, ever.

The whole complex is really clean and you will always be provided with a clean room and fresh water, everyday you return from exploring the close Ubud or one of the beautiful villages and ricefields nearby. Furthermore we experienced that the accommodation is a really good base for exploring the north of Bali as well. Due to the fact that you are a little outside of the overcrowded Ubud you could directly hop on your scooter and drive the less traffic roads to the north (e.g. we went to Gunung Batur and Nung Nung waterfall, going to Pura Ulan Danu Bratan would have been easily manageable as well).

This is the perfect place if you want to relax for a few days (or weeks), enjoy the day or evening at the pool next to the quiet ricefield watching the fireflies, but still be able to go to Ubud for dinner or attending a Yoga Class. Combined with awesome Hosts and staff member this will be a place you will miss once you‚Äòve finished your holiday.

Before I forget, breakfast is included and always made fresh, whether you prefer a balinese or more western ‚Äûegg breakfast‚Äú.  The tea or coffee is offered in a little french press, which is just cute and looks nice on your breakfast table.

As you may expect, we extended our stay for one more night and easily could have stayed longer...

I know this sounds like an advertisement, but we really really loved our stay at ADB. Thanks again for hosting us and hopefully see you again one day...

It was incredibly beautiful, modern, and felt like home. We stayed for over a week and had no complaints. The property manager was always quick to help whenever we had questions. The location was perfect too - with great restaurants nearby and just a short drive from Ubud. Thanks a lot and all the best to you!üôè","Beautiful hotel apartment villa, cozy clean room with spectacular view in front ! I think you‚Äôll enjoy more if you plan a long stay at Ubud, as they have all the cooking facilities along with coffee machines,even play station available !","This self-contained apartment is equipped with a kitchen featuring a blender, toaster, microwave, coffee maker, refrigerator, and a cooking stove. Additionally, there is a water dispenser in the room.

On-site workers are available, and the manager can be contacted via WhatsApp for any requests or issues, responding promptly to resolve them.

While a scooter can be arranged at the apartment, it comes at three times the cost compared to rates outside.

Numerous shelving units are provided for organizing clothes or items during your stay, although hangers would be a helpful addition.

The space appears slightly worn out, with sofa covers stained in the room and common area, differing from the photos shown on the platform.

Proper cleaning seems lacking, with visible stains on shower amenities and fingerprints on the refrigerator. Laundry services are not offered on-site, but nearby facilities within walking distance are available.

The compound features a small rice field, creating a breezy and cool atmosphere during the day.",,

House is old but the worst is the road. You will feel like you are sleeping on the highway. Only in the newer studio the sound of the street is doable. The aircon downstairs make a horrible loud sound and the garden is very small.,"I stayed at the villa for 7 days. My group spent our time between the villa and tours around Bali, but our time at the Villa was amazing. Pictures do not do this place justice.  Aswan, the house attendant was very attentive and provided delicious breakfast in the mornings. I recommend the in house massages and any decorations you need to be set up through him.  (Room floral decorations and balloon set up)

The villa is in the countryside of Bali, but we enjoyed the distance away from all the hustle of the city. Please keep in mind,  you are in the tropics, so there will be critters around (mainly in the nighttime),  but if you aren't afraid like me, you'd be fine.

We had a great stay and we'd definitely come back again.","It's a beautiful villa to share with friends or family. There are 3 separate rooms with each their own bathroom. The common area is beautifully decorated, the kitchen quite big. There is a separate kitchen table for breakfast and dinners. The pool was nice, not very big. I didn't particularly loved it, in one of the rooms there is mold on the ceiling and a weird smell. The service is great, breakfast was served tasty. The other room is very big, the bathroom bit small and there is no proper light. The other room was smaller, but the bathroom insane big with sofa and bathtub. It's bit of a hassle because who takes which room when it's so unequal. Laundry service was there and also scooter rental. It was a good stay, I liked it.","After a week there, we have mixed feelings.

Despite nice and helpful service, comfortable beds, pretty  good location and tasty breakfast there's margin  for  improvement.

- that's not the clearest  place, towels  were not fresh, as some of the outdoor  facilities as well.
- pool has not been cleaned.
- it was extremely  noisy during the  night  since  it's  located  beside  pretty  busy road.
-  the villa was unconvinced and unpleasant  while neighbours were smoking  some trashes just beside.","Beautiful, quiet location right next to a rice paddy field. The hosts were very helpful and accommodating to our needs and the breakfast was amazing! The rooms were very clean and the beds comfortable. The house itself is a beautiful Balinese style and has a good ambiance to it."

The room was very spacious and clean. Petri was an amazing host who made sure we had everything we needed and she organised a delicious breakfast for us every morning which we enjoyed on our balcony that overlooked some rice terraces. Renting a scooter was easily done through her as well. I recommend this place to anyone that wants to relax in the surroundings of Ubud.,"Our best accomodation during our trips in Asia, very clean, absolutely comfortable. A perfect place, very quiet with wonderful view.  Very nice family runs the business, they are extremely kind and hospitable. A bit out of the city but only 10 minutes with motor bike. It worth to rent one. The breakfast is very delecious. We will definitely come back.","Friendly and helpful staff, big clean rooms and bathroom cleaned everyday. Quite new hotel with view on small rice terrace,  they encourage clients to have a walk there. Next door to the hotel is little street food kitchen. The hotel helped with taxis, local drivers, speedboat booking etc. A few km from Ubud city center.","I like it especially the honeymoon package ... my wife picked the place because of it and its near many green and hills areas ... the room is so big and there is even a view of terrain and hills in the back.
Free breakfast pancake bread noodle and rice ... vegetarian option only though...
The place is deep in the villige ... make sure you have transportation on your hand","Really love this place. I've got here very late but they really assist me. Great and friendly service.

It has everything you need if you work remotely, with a very fast internet connection and in an ideal location for quick access to central Ubud . Only ten minutes to a local food market (much cheaper than in town)

Kadek and his family were the perfect hosts, always responding to our queries very quickly and always happy to help. Our privacy was always maintained thanks to the private entrance and garden and we were always greeted well by his friendly family. They also have a playful dog called Bobo :)

This villa is set 15 minutes north in the more tranquil area of Tegalallang. A lovely, charming place set in the iconic fields that Bali is so famous for. A private garden and views across rice paddies, with a beautiful, grand bespoke wooden table that's perfect for working or enjoying a big meal. Immaculately decorated with a fully equipped kitchen and a full size bath with an open shower.
