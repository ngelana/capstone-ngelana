You might think it's unfortunate that the power went out in the whole area right after we ordered, but I have to say we had some of the best and unique memories here.  The power outage didn't affect their service and food, and the staff brought us candles, which instantly turned the environment into a candlelight dinner!  Instead of being depressed by the accident, everyone was optimistic and sang happy birthday to the candles~

Roby keeps feeling sorry for the outage, but it's totally unnecessary.  He gave us extra dumplings and herbal tea, and offered to treat us to the meal.  But we know it's not his fault and he doesn't need to feel sorry for us.  In the end, we paid and he gave an extra 30% off. It is unimaginable that each person is 70k, or even less than 6 euros, which is unimaginable in Europe.

About the food, my favorite is the spicy fried beef and seafood soft tofu soup.  The beef is wrapped in lettuce and will not make people feel greasy at all.  Friends enjoyed the dumplings and herbal tea, which surprised us all.

Finally, Roby is also a K-pop lover, we shared our favorite songs and singers.  Compared with the relationship between the boss and the guests, we are more like friends who have not seen each other for a long time.  This is one of the happiest shops I feel in Bali, thank you~ I will definitely come back again!","Short story:
Great food, fair prices, best service.

Long story:
One of the best experiences of our whole trip.

Donut bites with Dulce de leche caramel sauce were little puff cinnamon croutons of delight. Definitely an admirable side to any brunch at the cute rustic comfy cafe. Had to wait out the rain so I got to try a couple varietals of coffee. Another good shout are their chocolate chip cookies, had to bag a salted Dulce to go.

We had cancelled some of our plans and activities just to stay in the house because of how beautiful and relaxing it was. The staff (especially Putu) were fabulous and so kind.

The only thing we noticed was that we could not shower at the same time as the hot water would get affected - one shower would get hit with cold water suddenly when the other shower was using the hot water. This didn‚Äôt impact us much as there was just 2 of us so we could shower at different times, however, might affect others who may be coming in a larger group.

The Service:

The staff seemed unaware of how to send live tracking for the missing items. I had to manually contact Gojek and follow up for almost 50 minutes.

Plus: the rooms are really nice in a typical Bali Villa set up with outdoor bathroom (yes, some don't like it, I do)
first disappointment: right after the booking some US machine is sending me 'not-a-welcome-message' - booking confirmation didn't even come in - but a series of options what I could spend my money on while there. ok... no biggie...
it was not possible to change the booking made via Expedia (I worked with Expedia for many years and know it's a matter of seconds to modify a booking on a client's request), but ok... another not so biggie
the staff was super helpful to arrange early-check so I could arrive and refresh.
biggie: there are 3 bungalows (and not villas as they are described) - only 2 of them are nice with garden. the 3rd one is squeezed with a wall right in front of it and the path everyone else is using to pass by. I did not plan to spend my money sitting on a stage for my trespassers...
after I asked the staff to please stop chatting in front of my room (favourite local hobby) and please move away from my bungalow as I would like to rest along with raising my concern about the unlockable main door, I was suggested: to lock my bungalow door and close the curtains. and while I know that this was not well thought of, I found it pretty sobering to spend my time sitting in a cubicle with closed curtains where every day some action was happening... mozzie fogging, cleaning, fellow visitors not able to enter without staff responding to it, etc.

highlight were the early morning calls with the US - by what I assume is the owner right behind the wall, that I involuntarily had to listen to - unless I closed my doors and curtains again.

the property appears smaller than on the photos as there are other properties around. but nothing to be bothered by.

the staff was making amusing comments about me when I was leaving, not realising that I speak Indo. such a put off...

altogether it would have been a beautiful stay, if I had another bungalow and an in house team that had the ability to grasp that travellers want to spend a decent and relaxed time while travelling. I felt sorry for having spent more than average here.

my Expedia review went off without the chance to add these details, but I hope that the remarks are taken note of.",I rented a villa by help of the booking.they write the private poor in the booking but when we came here we see that it is not a privale pool it is normal shared pool. I rented the villa because of the private pool. So it is totally scam.,"No roof in the bathroom. Full of mosquitos and other insects. Never got a refund for a full week, even though we didn‚Äôt spend one night",What a great place!!  We stayed in a Beautiful designed contemporary tropical bungalow. Nice out door showers. The place was really clean and the staff is the best. Really recommend,"Ohana is located in beautiful and peaceful Pererenan.
Away from the hustle and many great places to have breakfast and dinner.
Would recommend it. Great staff!"

The classic nachos were perfect, with the ground beef, sour cream etc. Also the pork carnitas burrito, very yummy.

I love Mexican food and I know when it‚Äôs not that good, well here it was very nice. The whole restaurant has a good mood and the waitress was very kind and smily. Thanks !","We ordered Chicken Enchiladas and Shredded beef Chimicangas, the starter we had chips salsa and cheese dip. The service was great, the food was great. And we got complimentary cheesecake for my birthday. We would highly recommend.","The burrito was nice and I like their hot sauces. Unfortunately when we visit the place it was under some sort of renovation so we can see some power tools and smell some chemicals in the air, but we were hungry and don‚Äôt want to look for other place so we stayed.

The staffs was friendly and I might give five stars later when they finished with renovations and clean up the toilet a bit more.","Satisfied all my Mexican cravings! Chips and guac with a cold, spicy michelada are my happy place. Everything was spot on and they have excellent homemade hot sauce on the table. Probably ate too many tacos as well, but they were sooo good!","Great tasting food that cured my craving for Mexican food. The shredded beef enchiladas were delicious, all washed down with a cold Bintang beer. Friendly service and laid back vibes."

It‚Äôs definitely a standout must visit if you‚Äôre in the area. Coffee is not expensive and tastes great. We had the Flat White with oat-milk. Plus the juices are fantastic. I had the watermelon basil lemonade and my wife had pineapple mango and we blown away. Bonus, is the ambiance. Great music playing really brings the whole vibe together . Plus the gratuitous use of the their branding alone is worth the visit.","I had the most delightful experience at this cafe! From the moment I walked in, the hilarious atmosphere had me chuckling non-stop. The staff were incredibly friendly and made us feel so welcomed! The menu boasted an array of dishes that were both delicious and innovative. Every bite was a flavor explosion that left me craving more. We ordered the hashbrown omelette, chicken parmigiana, mango smoothie bowl, a cappuccino and mocha.

I couldn't resist snagging some of their charming merchandise to remember the experience.
