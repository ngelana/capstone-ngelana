The rainbow pork rice bowl is quite nice and yummy, the mixture works well with sambal matah. The pork satay is pretty good as well.",Balinese style pork rice at next level! Try with their  Balinese Sambal Mata you can have the crispy pork belly as well as pork ribs. Better come in the late afternoon or dinner for cooler weather.,"Coming from a Malaysian (who is used to robust flavours), take what I say with a pinch of salt.

Satay is just pork belly skewers rather than true satay where it is processed further (texture wise).

Green chilli soup was good. The rest of the dishes were pretty underwhelming, was expecting more flavors - dishes were rather monotonous.

The biggest let down was the service however - it seemed that the staff members were very unhappy at the time, this may be a reflection of their working environment, however I digress.

Had to walk over to the counter to get table service - otherwise we would've been sitting down on the table waiting for pigs to fly.

Overall, with the combination of lacklustre flavors and poor service, unless you're in the area desperate for food, I wouldn't recommend this place - save your money.

I believe if the service could be improved a bit more, it would've made the experience more bearable.","First visit to Souphoria.

Ordered Green Chili Pork Soup. The soup was very spicy and rich in flavor, quite like it.

Too bad the SOP or the waitress is not encouraging service excellence for their clients, here is the story:

As it was served very hot, I accidentally spoiled the soup liquid on the table.

So I was asking for some more soup to enjoy the dish, but the waitress said they cannot give more soup.","Good food, service was okay, place is so hot but it was worth it since the food is delicious! I recommend their crispy pork with sambal matah and their soup! Just gofood/grabfood if you can‚Äôt stand the heat.."

Overall scale and style of the Architecture only makes sense in a big city center but not next to villas and rice fields.

In 2023, I spent a full month in the super cozy female dorm, and I was thrilled cz surprisingly it was so clean. The entire staff was friendly and cool, making it easy to chat with many guests there because the lounge was comfy for work and socializing. In 2024, I tried staying in their private room for over two weeks. It was really compact and perfect for solo living, with a smart TV and wifi, though the internet could be slow at times, it wasn't a big deal.

Overall, it was a 5/5 best experience, and I highly recommend staying here for a long time. I always recommend it to people to stay in here. AND ALSO, THE LOCATION IS EXTREMELY STRATEGIC, 7 minutes to Seminyak area, 5 minutes to Berawa and Canggu area.

As a bonus, there are two loyal dogs, Blacky and Upin, who accompany my daily life, they're super cute and friendly

Thank you so much Kultur, much much much loveeee.","Stay in their standard private room with a cozy and well designed interior. However, it seems that regular maintenance is needed. On the positive side, amenities like a water heater in bathroom and access to Netflix contribute to a pleasant experience. Thank you!","Positive:
- Clean rooms
- Fast internet
- Free breakfast
- Affordable
- There's a praying room

Negative:
- The location is too hidden
- The resepsionist respon's sometimes too slow
- Unfriendly staffs","This place feels very different from the photos. Most of the facilities have aged poorly, less clean than expected. I requested for a bottom bunk bed which was agreed to, but was given an upper bunk. I didn‚Äôt mind at first but at bedtime, I saw a hanging string of dirt from the ceiling and wanted to move immediately, but kind Ari helped me change bed eventually to a bottom bunk. The ceiling structure is less solid and does not cover from the roof entirely, so I‚Äôd suggest to sleep only on the bottom.

Other cons are, the working space is limited and people smoke around there which is unpleasant. Breakfast is super basic, toast is fine but at least provide better jams. The paddy field view that was shown in the pictures, is now blocked by a building next door. Toilet has no place to hang clothes and towel. It‚Äôs quite noisy from the Main Street, zero soundproof.

The pros are daily cleaning of the communal space and beds. Curtains, charging point and lights in the bunk are good, they even have a ventilator. Bed is comfy. Great service by staff and Ayu. Loved the refill station idea and water filter/purifier provided, the refill is the reason I chose this place. Fair for its price but next time I‚Äôd try somewhere newer.

[Update: Added 1 star due to kind and positive response by management]","This place is not good speacialy for bali. Bali has so many great accommodation and this capsule style hostel is just not it. Maybe if the photos and the recommendations of this place weren't good I would have been better prepared.

The rooms are not clean and the toilets/showers are grim. I found hair in my bed and the pillows are really small. Mattress is comfortable and the lighting is good. there is were the good things end.

the rooms are not sound proof and I could here people talking in the other room. I got an upper bed and everytime the person beneath me moved slightly my whole bed shook.

they say the offer breakfast but it's just a loaf of cheap bread and cheap jam. One can barely say this is a breakfast.

Do not recommend staying here."

However, there were some issues:
1. Calcium build up on the shower head.
2. Pool wasn't the cleanest. Green mold was growing on the tiles.
3. One of the fossets in the sink was not working at all.
4. The kitchen cutlery had this calcium build up all over them.","This is the first place we stayed at upon our arrival to Bali and can say it is a pretty decent place.
The staff - everyone is very friendly and we really appreciate them accommodating our late evening arrival and effectively getting us settled in. They even messaged us the following morning to check in. When my partner finished the coffee provided they were happy to give more.
The location - it's pretty far from main things but a 15 min walk down the street leads you to local √Ä la cart food options and there's a mini mart there to purchase snacks/drinks.
The Villa - very spacious. I love the space and his & her set of wardrobe + sinks. However there was a few things that made me give it a 3 star review.
1. One sink didn't work, making the his and her sinks pointless as everytime I had to brush my teeth or anything I had to go to the opposite from my set up.
2. The shower had major calcium build up that looks like it hasn't been cleaned properly in ages. My first instincts on arrival was to get some vinegar and scrub the shower head down along with the glass door as it was also dirty. The inside of the toilet was pretty dirty too.
3. The tub in the washroom was a beautiful length but again the lack of clean make it undesirable to use. Also it didn't help that there were ants all over the washroom and when doing my makeup or sitting on the toilet they just crawl onto you.
4. The pool was an amazing enjoyment and a place we spent a lot of our time however it had a hole in the bottom middle that we kept stepping into. A small detail that can be easily corrected with a cheap cover. Also one of the lights didn't work in the pool.
5. The door to the entrance of the villa isn't the most secure...
6. There's supposed to be a restaurant there making it easier to get food but it wasn't in operation.
I will say some things that I loved about the place was that the sheets smelt amazing and were super comfy. Plus the staff provide an adapter in the room incase you forget yours.
If your traveling on a budget it is definitely a great place to stay and I would highly suggest investing into scooter lessons and renting one out as it's safer then walking along the street.
It does feel like that Villa Victoria was the place to go in the prime of its days however it feels as over the years along with lack of proper care it seems to be more of a ancient place.","One luxury stay with a reasonable pricing. The stay is about 20 mins approx from the airport.
First of all thankyou to the staffs and you were so helpful and service was really good.
The location is nearby a prime spot with a good locality. Easily accessible.
The rooms are so spacious with all the amenities (Tv, refrigerator which is a common one for the other villa ,a/c, swimming pool which is again a common for the other room) so in a property of villa Victoria,there are 2 separate rooms, but when we checked in the other room was vacant, so the kitchen, swimming pool could be used only by us.
The staffs do a proper room service whenever needed.
The only point to be noted is breakfast to be added separately.
They do provide cab facilities, however grab app is a recommended one for cab.

Had a pleasant stay","Beautiful spacious rooms. Private pool and awesome dinning space. Just few improvements needed:
1. Need shades near private swimming pool so that sunbath rest wouldnt be wet after rains
2. Need to have some sort of activities. The villa is beautiful. But there is nothing else to do. Or maybe there is and reception people never told us
3. Restaurant needs more dishes. Specially vegetarian!

All said, we had a pleasure stay and wouldn't  mind staying again here.","I stayed in the one-bedroom villa with my husband for our honeymoon. The room was very comfortable with clean bathroom and bathtub. But the toilet smelled kinda bad. The private pool was very nice too. The staffs were friendly.

Big pool in the center, with all the rooms around. Each room is very well decorated in a Bali style. All lot of placed to chill. Well maintained garden.
The location is great: close to the beach (15mins by scooter, 30mins by walk) and its beach clubs (Finn's, Atlas, Patato Head) but also shops and clubs like Lafavela (15mins taxi). Yet around the villa the traffic is good.
Very quiet place.

I booked Sol Lila Bali villa through Airbnb but I run into troubles with Airbnb website and they canceled the booking due to issues on their side. But through all the process, the owner of Sol Lila Bali, JO. helped and supported me a lot!
The staff at the villa is also very nice and very helpful.

I recommend this place at 100%, you will have a great time their for sure!

Loic","I was looking for a Villa for my family and friends for my 40th Birthday Celebration and Vow Renewal. I saw a handful that met my criteria, however Sol Lila stood out amongst all the villas I was able to search. As you all know most of the villas in Bali is just one building with rooms and the pool in front. What I wanted was to have the feel of being in Bali and not just another hotel-styled villa. Luckily, I came across Sol Lila in AirBNB. Individual villas with a beautiful pool in the middle (everyone enjoyed it as we can just jump in it anytime of the day!). The Villa‚Äôs proximity to the airport, shopping and sightseeing is perfect (Between 30-45 minutes from the airport depending on traffic). Sol Lila has different, vibrant, personalised decors per Villa, the outdoor shower is phenomenal. The Villa is already BEAUTIFUL and once the event started (with all the decors) we felt that we were transferred to another charming place. We also requested for a massage, and their masseuse contact was very good (everybody fell asleep during the therapy). The owner Joe has been very accommodating since day one, he assisted me with the transfers and answered all my questions regarding my event. Once we got to the villa, Titin, the manager has been very hospitable, assisting the suppliers where to put the decors, even offering us a complimentary coconut! She was always available whenever I have questions where to shop, even giving us the proper directions to tell to the Grab Driver. Shout out to Rika and Gudai for the lovely breakfast everyday. The coffee, fruits, eggs & croissant is amazinggggg!!!! To Bimo who has been assisting us in the Villa, thank you! They always have a friendly smile the moment they see us.  Ambiance of the villa is important, but the warmth of the staff makes it more memorable. Hands down to Sol Lila, I highly recommend the place. Well done and more power to each and everyone!",Comfortable stay. Well designed airbnb. I think a lot of your experience depends on who else is there - which isn't to do with the villa itself. My stay was dampened by the other guests being fairly unfriendly but at least the room was nice. The pool was great to dip in and the staff I encountered were friendly. Quite hard to walk anywhere so I got taxis to get around. The outdoor bathroom was cute,"The place is very well kept by friendly staff, great service, cleanliness and location. Light breakfast is served everyday between 8-11am and they even serve you some welcome drinks upon checking in, which is nice. The pool is quite nice as well. You can rent scooters from here for around 60k indr/day. Overall, amazing service and great location for exploring Bali.","Sol Lila is a stunning property to visit. Beautifully thought out, each Villa and room is unique and individual. With collectable antiques and a designer setting. The staff and owners very polite and helpful. Very central to great restaurants, shopping and not far from the beach. I would highly recommend this accommodation."

Pros:
Rooms are very spacious. The property itself is super lush and there‚Äôs lots of lovely birds chirping‚Ä¶ a rare oasis in Canggu.

Cons:
They sprayed the room with a strong perfume right before we checked in and it took several hours for it to go away. It was hard to breathe. In the morning, it gave space for a moldy musty smell. We also stopped them from spraying the room with Bygone (mosquito chemical) right before we walked into the room. We woke up to termite residue covering our luggage that fell from the roof. The bed was really uncomfortable and had a massive dip. The pillows were also massive and smelled of the perfume spray.","The other Mathis properties (Ubud, Amed) are good and great. This one is just ok. Used to be bigger and better.

The room size is still great, and the location is still what it is, but quality of the place has faded. For 500K a room, would be a decent deal. I paid more and was less than happy.",Very spacious villas with an outdoor and pool area. Beds are very comfortable and air-conditioning works well. It's also very quiet despite the area can be busy (villas are next to the main road in Umalas). Service was good but unfortunately the bar and restaurant are still not open and might be for July,"I had a wonderful experience at Villa Mathis. Every staff member I encountered, from the reception to the cleaning staff were delightful and eager to help! Thank you!
The rooms and villas were very clean, very comfortable and very big.
Due to the quality of the service in Villa Mathis and the fast reactions of the staff, we were able to get our plane in time, as our taxi which was organised from another company hasn't shown up.
I will definitly come back to the properties of the Mathis Collection.","The rooms are nice, clean, there is a very large terrace. . The bathroom is open air, the swimming pool is big,

And it's open for ""swapping house""

The location is very good.  Close to canggu . Close to Seminyak ..so many good restaurant nearby ."

Thank you very much! We would always come back! ‚ò∫Ô∏è","This is for Villa Moyo number 2.Villa.Balezia.You can find it on airbnb.
Keep this listing,save it when you need it.

We were on a family trip, with 5 adults and 1 child.it fits perfectly for us,accomodates us all,nicely decorated and with great layout.

The location,well,it's Umalas,has small roads,less lighting at night,so it's best to rent a car or bike rather than walk your way.The villa has quite big entrance that can fit minibus.

For the villa,it's spacious,has a lot of sunlights,we really like it. Our daughter sleeps and actives really well at the villa,that's a big score for us.
Pak Eko helps a lot on our daily needs,thank you also for that. There are some minor issues, but if you look at the overall villa,you will be happy.","Villa Moyo #4 is definitely not worth it at all to be stayed-in. The condition of the villa is really disgusting! For two weeks rent, my husband and i must deal with so many things. Not recommended at all!","Found this villa thru AirBnb and it's very much better compared to our last villa. This one has a huge pool, long enough to do laps, but too deep for us short Asians, meh. Rooms are cozy, got speedy internet, cable TV and fully functioned kitchen.

A bit far from the airport and better to reach it with a bike or a car. Definitely not a public transport kinda place.

But best thing about it, a pullup bar!!","A lot of NOICE! Crazy people from rise fields shout from yearly morning 6:00 ü§¨also construction sounds, Not Relax Place ‚úã (Two months experience )"

We even had to take some desserts home because we were too full to eat anything else but needed to try more. It‚Äôs with the drive and time.

Quite pricey, but worth treating yourself to every once in a while.

The instrumental jazz music capped off the general vibe of the cafe. Very classy.",I love everything in this place. croissant was perfectly chewy and flaky with a bit of sweet taste. ham and cheese croissant was sooo good. mango danish was made with sweet real mango fruit and the custard was balance too. I think all the pastries here is really good. the vibe was very very nice and the owner also very friendly too. service also nice. a bit pricy for me personally but it's worth the price for the experience and quality of ingredients. I will recommend this place and will be back for sure.,"It is absolutely happy to find one of the Best Bakery Shop in Bali. Newly opened, sensuous interior design(even toilet!), cozy environment, most impressive was great taste of Bread. I took set menu it contains coffee & juice(both! And juice was so fresh!!) & bread. Then I choose another bread, ham croissant  was OMG.. so I did take away, which usually I don't. Also the staffs were really kind and courteous.
Only one thing I feel sad was it takes 1hour to go there, however I don't mind distance,definitely I will be back again & again.. No doubt to recommend.","Had dinner at The Basket last night.
Stunning food presentation with an eye for detail and delicious too!

The freshness of their offerings really  good. I enjoyed the onion quiche; it was not greasy, and the crust was wonderfully thin. Their ham and cheese croissant was also excellent.

The coffee was of high quality and not too acidic, which is a big plus for me.

The staff are super helpful and clean your villa whilst you‚Äôre out and can do laundry and organise taxis if required.

The main negatives are the lighting in the rooms, the blinds need replacing to keep the rooms darker in the early morning. Additionally the deck by the pool is old and breaking, it needs replacing but we avoided using it where we could.

The villa itself is spacious with a pool, living hall, dining place with kitchen. It was clean and well maintained. The breakfast provided was also good.
