We visited on a weekday sunny afternoon with a party of 5 people. We were given the hut above the pond, where we could see fishes right under our feet. The whole property was beautiful, full of greenery.

The food did not disappoint either. We had their signature BBQ prawn and fried fish. English menu available as well.

We didn't encounter any mosquitoes, but I imagine if you were to visit in the evening there would most likely be mosquitoes.","Highly recommended for tourists. Found the restaurant on other social media. Surprisingly, the staffs can speak English fluently. We were shown to the table and the waiter introduced the menu well. The dishes were served fast and the presentation was great. We ordered a set menu, it comes with seafood dishes, rice, chili sauces, water and fruits for dessert. The restaurant is well decorated, there are areas for kids and private groups. The seafood ingredients are kept in glass tanks with price labelled. It was quite crowded in the late evening. The parking spaces are packed too. We had a good time at the restaurant. Highly recommended for tourists that enjoy spicy Asian taste.","Calm and relaxing atmosphere, great and super delicious food. Cant even say which food is the best because everything was so delicious.
Walking distance to Trans Studio.
Kids had their time to feed the fish in the pond and indoor playground.
Warmth services and friendly staff.
Overall we had an exceptional time there.","My only regret is not finding out about this place sooner! Honey grilled prawns were absolutely delicious and addictive, along with the salted egg squid. I don’t think there was any dish we weren’t impressed with. The place was also very aesthetic and had such a relaxing atmosphere (thought it could get a little warm in the afternoon but that’s just the weather). Funnily enough the toilets have AC so if you’re feeling warm feel free to make a quick trip to the loo. They have an extensive menu so you’ll never run out of dishes to order. The meal was also affordable. Service was great too, servers were very attentive and friendly. Highly recommend! Definitely put this place in your list when you’re in Bali","Bali has some great local food that I personally enjoy is here. If you want to call the staff, you just need to hit the bamboo that hanging and they will come. It’s quite interesting!"

The food was tasty, as expected. The portion was also quite generous. The service from the staff was also impeccable, despite it being crowded at the time I was there.
One advice is to better book a table & choose the menu a day before, since it gets full quite fast.","Very good food ,relaxing restauran and nice atmosphere, I love it and my friends also enjoy it .you guys in bali should visit this place really recommended.",The interior design is top notch that fits the middle eastern ambience but the food was nothing special. We ordered The rice (biryani & mandi with chicken) & kebab chicken is so so. I think those reviews here were overrated. Not to mention that the chicken that I ate already smell a bit rotten. My opinion is that  biryani rice with chicken at Ijab Qabul Resto ways more delicious and much cheaper and also their sambal is unbeatable. Sambal here is not good at all.,"The staff was very friendly, helpful, and very informative. They had deep knowledge about the menus from the taste, texture, ingredients, etc. They also informed us about the free henna session, and the henna turned out really nice too.
Food was great, tasty and rich of flavor. The lamb didn't smell at all. Kebab was very juicy. They also gave out arabic coffee & korma for welcome drink & testers."

---","Cool theme park and amazing experience.

Boomerang is absolutely a must ride rollercoaster for adrenaline junkie and one of the main reason i go to this theme park. My favorite all the time.

Bat Glider and Go-Kart are also very fun to ride.

Flying Over Indonesia, I like this simulator ride. Very relaxing, fun, & good with high technology.","Its so fun to visit TS theme park. My favorite one is flying over indonesia. Should try it, whenever you come to Bali.","I had really low expectations and it actually delivered on a really fun day out.
Pros:  good for young kids, the rides were cute and at times a bit kitsch with go karting, fly over Indonesia and rapid river being hits with our little brood. They also have an iFly if you like indoor skydiving.
Cons: the food options were beyond terrible and there are no pass outs. Top tip, eat before you get in there!
If you have younger kids and want to entertain them out of the heat for a few hours, give it a go as they'll get a kick out of it...oh, and keep a look out for the zombie apocalypse!","It's ok for a theme park. The best ride was the fly over Indonesia. Well worth it.
Unfortunately the roller-coaster wasn't working.

Bad receptionist lady, dirty room, unwashed sheets smells of drool, dirty fridge, AC on & off, water pipe has animals like black worm very soft sign of they don't clean the water tank and green water pool! believe me I just stay 3 hours then quickly move to other better guest house. What a nice picture they show to us.","For all of you who want to stay here, please think again, check the reviews before staying here.

My first & last experience staying at this hotel.

Don't be tempted by cheap prices, because where there is a price there must be quality.

The AC is not cold, the bathroom smells, there are no toiletries and dirty towels.

The receptionist is not there, so it is very difficult when you want to complain.

I stayed here during New Year 2024

VERY NOT WORTH IT.","The worst experience ever!
I sent multiple messages for info but only one automatic message responded without obviously resolving my doubts. At check in a lady quickly handed me the keys without showing me where to go and disappeared. I found the room...I have to say that all the negative reviews are absolutely deserved. Balcony lights not working, power sockets almost disconnected, fridge turned off and dirty, bed perhaps washed but with badly smelling and stained sheets, unspeakable walls, mold from ceiling to floor, glass and mirrors with clearly visible white streaks therefore cleaned with dirty rags , dirty or stained, badly smelling towels and carpets, dirty bathroom in need of renovation, without toilet paper or soap. Let's say that the structure has potential if it were taken care of! It looks like an abandoned building and nothing like what you see in the photo! Honestly, for that price, despite being cheap, you can find better. To make sure I didn't miss anything, I asked a guy at the reception if he had a socket for my phone, he came to the room because he didn't understand what I needed, he bothered me by trying to kiss me. He apologized several times and I let it go but obviously I didn't have a good night. I don't recommend a stay here to anyone, much less a solo girl. I don't think the other rooms are better but I haven't seen them. I'm sorry, I never leave negative reviews but this place really blew me away. The area is also poor in services, only a mini mini market front and an open corner Korean BBQ in the evening.","Sadly the Room was not as clean as in the Pictures... Paint is coming off the Wall everywhere, the toilet was smelling really really bad, no hot water for the shower. Sadly I cannot recommend and would not come again. Location was pretty good as the Mall is 2 mins by foot.","the picture of the room given does not match what is advertised, the room is smelly and humid, and the bathroom smells even hot water is not available, the walls are not maintained and there are many leaking spots from the roof, the bed linen is dirty and smells bad like it hasn't been washed, even the door lock is very difficult to open (I was locked for 2 hours because the door could not be opened and there was no reception number that could be contacted), I don't recommend you to stay here, but for the location I think it's strategic. it's a pity that a hotel with a strategic location is very poorly maintained."

Will be a regular next time I go on holiday to Bali.

:)","Just a heads up if need a night or two on arrival before you start your amazing adventure here in Bali or when departing somewhere close to the airport for that last nights sleep & no doubt you will be pondering of course how when you arrived how much these unique people made you feel to be a special friend & now you are also feeling they are very special friends as well.

Bali Unique In Every Way. This Is Why We Live Here.

Anyhow back to your hotel needs. Mansu Hotel near Transmart in Legian is clean, tidy & comfortable. Air con, Hot Water, Good beds & Pool and Warung onsite.

The managers Kadek and Cica and their team will help you where they can. The tariff only 300,000 idr a night including breakfast. At that rate you might use them as a base for your whole trip. What a good idea.

Mansu when only the best will do and not break your bank or blow the budget for your very special holiday.","I stayed for 4 nights, very friendly staff, great food in the restaurant, good size rooms with hot shower. Excellent value for your money.  I'll stay with them again next time I come to Bali, thx.","Kamar sesuai dengan foto di Agoda, ada pool yang bersih, ada area tempat duduk jdinya ga melulu di kamar, front office yg ramah, strategis to go anywhere, dan sesuai dgn harga, but there are some things should be improved like toilet cleanliness, the blanket should be changed bcs there are some spots, and i’ve been stay for 2 days, the housekeeper necessarily cleaned the room but there is any service. And the last one, the TV quality should be improved too .. thanks","This place is trap! Its not well maintained, looks like built 10 years ago and no maintained at all. I checked 3 rooms, stayed for 2 nights, the worst nights in my life. All the rooms are smelly, stinky, bed sheet and towels are dirty, with stains, yellowish, you really hesistate even touch it, AC not freezing. Look like nobody take care of the place properly. For its price not worth at all, 1 star out of 5 and only for stuff, they are resposible and friendly guys, and breakfast, they have selection of omelete, fried rice or noodle and even chicken veggie soup. The rest is just terrible. Dont understand good reviews and rating at agoda and google, not true at all. Dont buy it and never come here cause you will be super dissapointed."

We came here 4 years ago just before Covid. Overall quality and offering seems to be going downhill.","Best crab in town, great price! Overall better than good! Can’t afford to miss this joint if you’re a seafood lover!","Recommendation from a local friend and there were a few hits and misses dining at this local warung.

Hits : Soft shell crab with garlic and chili, black pepper crab and steamed fish with garlic and ginger.

Soft shell crabs crunchy, tasty and just salty enough to make this a great appetizer or snacking kind of dish. Black pepper crab amazing ! Crab was really fresh and the black pepper sauce went so well with the crab meat it had me licking the sauce of my fingers. Steamed fish was a real highlight as well, the broth was super tasty and fish was very tender.

Misses : sweet n sour prawns, grilled clams with peanut sauce.

Prawns were very average, pretty small and while the sweet and sour sauce was ok it wasnt really special. I felt that the spice level way overpowered everything else. The clams as well, while it wasnt bad, just wasnt a standout in anyway. Would recommend to check it out if you are in the area.","I got the super hot amount of spice for yummy Kepiting Saus Padang

AC, hot water, fairly new rooms and a pool. However The pool is fairly cold as it receives very little sunlight. This side street is fairly quiet and the staff are friendly without being intrusive. Grab taxi is very easy to get all hours from this location.","Perfect bang for your buck. Only $22/night when I went in Jan 2017. It is about a 30 minute cab ride from the airport and for the price, well worth it. The rooms are simple but very clean and functional. It has Double Bed, Shower (that is hot), toilet that flushes, TV (with random alarms set around lunch time).","Great place, nice and comfy, the room also clean and the staff here are very friendly and helpful....
