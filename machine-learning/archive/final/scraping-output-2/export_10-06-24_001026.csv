We had amazing experience there!
Meals in the room, great food, all cheerful staff.
Was simply great to rest and explore ubud, the rice plantations and the waterfalls around

Thank you all","Mario was the best host we could expect. The whole staff is amazing and the place in itself is insanely beautiful and surrounded by cool activities and more genuine and local spots to visit.

Super recommend for who is looking  for a quiet stay and out of the confusion.","The rooms are great and the swimming pool has a nice high view of the rice fields. The service is meh, the staff can barely speak English and the breakfast is poor. The place has great potential and they can do a lot better.","We arrived at night time and how I felt at first was regret.
However, in the morning, the view through the terrace was stunning.
The accommodation was surrounded with rice field and it was beautiful.
The swimming pool which I would rather call it a  small but deep public bath was a kick.
If someone who really wants to take a break from busy life should definitely go there.
However, it was a bit humid and the bed was damp.

Some advice to the owner : if you also have bike rental business from the hotel, it will help your business grow up. Also it would be nicer if you have a dehumidifier in each room.

For someone who is considering to book here : please arrange taxi & motorbike beforehand(pick/drop included).
It will make your stay easier and relax."

It is comfy, cozy and clean all the time. Bed is comfortable, bathroom looks very new. Beautiful garden is full of flowers and trees, all very well-kept. Large pool is the common area of two villas but we happened to use it alone all the time, even if we would be 4 people in the pool, there would be no problem as it is big enough. I woke up early to catch the sunrise and it was such a nice view, sunrise was just in front of our villa. If you need, you can ask them to give a ride with additional charge, we used it for tirta empul and the last day to Kuta. It is a family-run place and they are so hospitable, friendly, helpful all the time.","I rented a villa, I got a masarda above the garage where the owner keeps his car.  The private pool is the pool of the location, it is not really private. I came for peace and found noises of chainsaws and digging machines working the land. of
The furniture is very old and the cleanliness is very poor, there is dust everywhere, dead insects.  The TV remote does not work, the refrigerator does not cool,  the internet is a joke. Breakfast is very limited and prepared in a rudimentary kitchen of questionable cleanliness.
it is very difficult to order food through local applications, almost all of them are refused because the location is too far.
he didn't let us see the rooms. and the first thing we did when we arrived was to pay for the accommodation.
I paid for 3 nights, I left after the first night.  The owner did not want to help us with any request, he said that the money has been paid and that we only have to givea  review,  that he hase many positive ones.  I don't know why anyone would give a positive review under such conditions.","Even more beautiful than at photos!
Very friendly people, family business. 50m from Rice terrace Pegallalang, very close (with motor bikes the best option) to Waterfalls, Temple from 11 century ...
Recommend for stay! 5 stars from us!
Zoran, Serbia","Amazing place, literally just five meters from Tegallalang Rice Terrace entrance. Rooms are big, the garden and the pool are amazing. Owners are very nice and friendly. I would only upgrade the bathroom, because it's very basic.",It was amazing villa. You can eat floating breakfast for free. And people here are so sweet. I'm surely recommend this is the one you are looking for.
