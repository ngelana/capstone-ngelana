The staff is really nice and helpful, especially reception. There are daily shuttles to Ubud, they took around 30-45 min depending on traffic.

The restaurant accommodates for vegans, adapting the dish where possible.

The only downside was the shower where the temperature was hard to set, for the most time it was either too hot or cold.","Beautiful hotel and lovely restaurant staff.

Although reception staff are very rude and unhelpful. I stayed for 5 nights and had no room cleaning, no clean towels. The food needs improving, the breakfasts were awful and not as described on the menu. The wifi doesn't work in the rooms.

The massage was great but the room next door to the treatment room was having work done so there was a drill and hammer going for the whole 1 hour massage.

The complex is beautiful and has so much potential but I wouldn't recommend staying here. Much better places near by.","Absolutely stunning Jungle Villa. My wife and I loved our stay and the fantastic hospitality the Senetan team provided. They were always quick to assist and make us feel as comfortable as possible.

The location, though far from Denpasar, is neatly located in a small village in the Jungle. There is no hustle and bustle of vehicles with most of the villas facing into the nearby valley allowing for some beautiful privacy for those that choose to stay here. The free daily transfers to Ubud makes it easy to get around if you just plan staying in the area.

The food and drinks were absolutely delicious, and whilst they might've not nailed the taste in traditional Western dishes that others might complain about, we were loving the local dishes tastes and textures. My wife still raves on about the Banana smoothies here and we loved the daily fruit juices as they were the best we had on the island for our entire stay.

Rooms are fanatic and spacious, the beds are incredibly comfortable. Downside many have complained about is the maintenance, which is understandable in some cases because
1. It is a humid jungle, things don't last long
2. The Villas were built just before COVID and would've taken a huge hit financially.
So Maintenance might not always be the quickest to be done, but it does get done and the items that are broken don't affect the comfort of guests.

Again, I can't stress how amazing this stay was, as it's a true jungle experience and wonderful waking up to the sounds every morning to the jungle or taking a relaxing swim in the pool. Location is also great if you want to explore more of the island but have a central point. Takes about 2 hours to get to most parts of the island from here which makes it great for sightseeing.",Despite long distance to the villas but worth it! Perfect for person or couple that want staycation and enjoy me time. The meal above average. The service and hospitality were outstanding. The room and facility were excellent. The only challenge was the bugs at night. Definetely someday we will back again.,A very good start from check in to welcome drinks and a foot massage before enjoying the villa. Really the best service here compared to hotels in Australia. It can even beat 5 star luxury hotel in Australia.

Tried to contact the property - no response from all the numbers.

After we came not very late, around 10:30 pm, thanks to the barking dogs we managed to wake up a lady, who clearly was not understanding what is happening and who we are, not speaking english at all (it is not big deal) and not knowing is the room ready or not.
She showed us a room, which turned out to be all dirty after previous tenants, the shower was all in mud and leafes, no bathtub, some garbage in the room, old dirty bedsheets and mold curtains. We said that room is not ready (having to go back and forth between her and the room a few times) and she started to clean rigth in front of us..
We asked for another room or booking cancellation. She showed us different room with at least clean bedsheets. We decided to stay just for sleep because the booking was non-refundable and we were tired.
No hot water at all, AC barely worked. The property looked abandoned, all in dog's pee and the dogs itself barking non-stop right before our room. And the place itself quite close to the road, so loud bikes coulb be heard clearly.
Having quite bad sleep we run away as soon as possible.

Very bad experience..","The title is hideway, and it is real hideway in Ubud. It's just like a hidden gem, i book just 1 day before arrival, the price is crazy cheap! Less than 100K IDR per night, an air-con room including breakfast, BUT I think they upgraded my booking because i supposedly booked female dorm with share bathroom, instead of that, they gave me a nice room with big bed and private Hot shower inside room.

THE SERVICE WAS AMAZING, staff are very friendly, breakfast was SUPER, towel and bedsheets are clean. Bathroom clean but a little improvement would not be bad.

The place is not hard to find, you just googlemap and they have a sigh on the entrance gate so you wont get lost.

Definitely will be back!!!","If you like to be in the middle of nowhere it's perfect, far from the main touristique place but with a motorcycle you can go easily everywhere.
Room ok, bathroom with not really hot water.
Breakfast really good üëåüèº","This resort was absolutely fantastic! The rooms are VERY clean and updated, the AC is cold, the pool was relaxing, and the WiFi is fast. The staff was so welcoming and helpful, they really  went out of their way to make us feel at home! In addition, we were treated with a huge Balinese breakfast each morning by the pool! The resort was so relaxing and quiet, it made for a perfect couples getaway. It is somewhat far from town, so plan transportation accordingly! Thank you Ubud Hideaway for a wonderful experience!","This place is far away and isolated from ubud. And inform the staff well in advance if you are arriving late.
Best experience, is the stay and the place itself.
Staffs were very friendly and helpful. I had met with an accident during my stay and they took real good care of me.
When I met with accident, I called the hotel and informed them, as I was traveling alone. A staff came and took me back to the hotel. They cleaned all my wound and treated with medicines.
The way I was treated is nothing less to a service given by a 5 stay hotel."

And the last one, this is the most incredible trip we did so far, friendly guide and they had a magic hand to taking a great video and pictures for us, for absolutely we have a lot of fun on this tripüôåüèª","We had a fantastic time quad biking with our guide, Putu Deo!

She exudes kindness, patience and love in her service.  I will admit the place is off the beaten path but it is a good place for reflection, meditation, relaxing and reading. It hosts a tropical paradise with a beautiful pool.  If you are looking for a more central place this is not it.  I guess it is really up to you what you desire in a vacation.
My personal experience has been very delightful.
This photo I have posted is a traditional Hindu - Japanese rice birthday meal in which Mini prepared for me.
Thanks Mini....","Nice ambience, good for getaway, but need to improve their service and maintenance. Recomended if you looking for budget accomodation or backpacker.",,,
