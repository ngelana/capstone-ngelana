There was not a large amount of choices in the breakfast menu (fried Noodle or fried rice) but it was really yummy!
During the night we could ear the wild animals, and the sanitary were a bit far from my room but its okay.","We didn‘t have that much luck with our stay here. We booked the standard double room. The first room we had unfortunately had some animals (maybe mice or rats) between the roof and the ceiling. They were so loud running around. First we tried to stay in the room. But we just couldn‘t after a few hours. The bedding was also not very clean there was some little poopy things on it. Had to be recent because we brushed it off and then went out to dinner. Afterwards there was some new one on the bed again. Also there was a huge spider in the doorway (just in case anyone wants to know) but that didn’t really bother us because it‘s a tree house. Luckily the owners were still there at night so we asked to switch rooms. They were understanding and gave us a new room.
The sunrise from the tree house in the morning was beautiful to watch.
The owner makes breakfast for you. The choices were nasi goreng and mie goreng.","Great hideout and relaxing place! It is not a fancy hotel but the experience was quite delightful. We even stayed one extra night. The TreeRoom was clean and with an amazing view directly to Mount Agung. The family is extremely nice and the food was limited (only Nasi/Mie Goreng) yet pretty good.

Even though therere shared bathrooms, they are super clean with hot water...and enough closed bathrooms for every guest. It has a Summer Camp kinda feel.  And since there isnt many people (one extra couple in our case), the bathrooms were just perfect.

If you are thinking in visiting Lake Bratan and the Waterfalls around, this is a great place to stay.","Unique place to stay in cabins perched high from the ground and made of bamboo and other materials. Situated in a lush, farming area with very nice on site landscaping. Staff was very friendly and manager helped me with out an early breakfast so I could go to the Bratan Temple to take sunrise photos. Food was good and the woman who cooked it was so kind. Very easy to get to local places with a scooter (I recommend renting one and touring with it)

Bathrooms are shared which I wasn't expecting. Had issues with the WiFi working sporadically and there isn't a proper lock on the door. It's a bit costly compared to other nearby places if it's just one person. Highly recommended for couples. These things are why I took a star off of the rating.","Nestled in the middle of bedugul farming villages, the tree house provide calm, cold and relaxing atmosphere.
The forest is just bordering with the house.

The family is very accommodating to our needs, thumbs up.

We went to the Banyumala twin waterfall 30 minutes motorbike ride from here, hike down to the base, have a great swim.
And back to rest at the house while enjoying the sunset over the mount batur horizon."
