I wish all villas in Bali to be like Home Villa! I love you, Home Villa,  and promise to come back!","This is the best place in Lavina, it‚Äôs super comfortable, clean, very tasty breakfasts and an incredibly kind, attentive and hospitable owner. Special thanks for the information about walking with dolphins!",Very nice stay! Will come again next time in Lovina. Owner super friendly!,"Had a great stay. Simon and wife super friendly, will be back on the next event","Staff was super friendly and helpfull. We had a little accident with our motorbike and they helped us without any question. Again, very friendly and helpful! Rooms were very clean. Pool was super super super clean and prices are good for Lovina. You‚Äôll live in an open kitchen/living area so sometimes the privacy is limited, but we only met nice and engaging people. 100% go back!"
ChIJgQZWODWb0S0RQM_iM8C5Wyw,Villa lilly,-8.178065799999999,115.02451730000001,"R2CF+QRC, Kaliasem, Banjar, Buleleng Regency, Bali 81152, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=3196352595704860480,OPERATIONAL,,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.4,19,,"PROS: Staff members are nice and helpful, the AC is the best I've experienced in a Bali villa thus far, the cat that hangs around is wonderful and the villa is gorgeous.

CONS: The listing on airbnb is not at all accurate (says it has a powerful sound system in the pool but apparently that broke a while ago, says it has a washing machine which also apparently broke a while ago, the door handle is nearly falling off and we were made to check out at 11 even though the listing says checkout is noon","We booked the villa for roughly four weeks just for two people and we are very happy with our choice.
It looks exactly like the pictures and is even bigger in reality.
Budi (the housekeeper) and her team are the heart and soul of the entire villa and keep everything running smoothly. Every day we got a fresh breakfast cooked for us by Budi. However, she is not only a gifted chef, but a multi-talented one, too. No matter what request we had, she always helped us in a friendly and helpful manner and handled absolutely everything.

You can easily spend several days at a time in the villa without missing the outside world. If you do want to go out and meet people, it only takes a maximum of 7 minutes on a scooter. But be aware that the roads are a bit challenging, but manageable, even if you are a novice scooter-driver.

There is a big point deduction for the organization in advance with the management and the lack of management support during our long-term stay. Since our flights were canceled two times in a row, we canceled the villa, however, with the communication that we are looking for a new flight for the same period. After a short time we found and booked a new flight for virtually the same time period, we also re-committed to the villa. For the renewed booking, they have once again charged us nearly the full amount, although we did not get any money back after the initial cancellation.  The lack of cooperation we find very pity, because we have discussed our problems and the procedure way in advance. During our stay, the management did not even ask about our well-being or if we are missing anything. In the whole month of our stay we only talked to the managment, including Alessandro, for about 10 minutes in total. We would have appreciated a little more care from their side. Without Budi and her fantastic service we would not too happy with our stay at the villa. But the way she taken care of her guests and let the villa feel alive, she realy enabled us a wonderful stay at Lovina.

Other than this exceptional situation, the villa is recommendable. Just be insured, that your stay will be pleasant due to Budi and her team and not the management behind the villa.","Nice villa, huge space, big pool. The kitchen is amazingly complete and the staff can cook for you. Not easy to reach, you need a car or a motorbike, but once inside it worth. There're small things need to be maintained but the overall experience is positive","Cozy place to stay, very quiet, got your privacy here. Very nice",Excellent villa at North Bali

The garden is quite huge and in a perfect condition, as well as the house. Wanda and the other guys from housekeeping doing a great job and are so friendly! üôè highlights are the big pool and the rooftop terrace with a wonderful view over the jungle. I can recommend you 100% that place for staying and have a great time.","Having the most amazing experience here. Very helpful host, was very responsive before, during and after our arrival. Arranged us transport from the airport at a extremely reasonable price, even after our flight got delayed meaning our driver was waiting over two hours for us! Same guy also does the Dolphin tours and other activities just ask staff member Mr Wanda, he‚Äôs awesome. Greeted us on arrival, carried our bags inside and gave us a tour of the outstanding villa. Each morning he‚Äôd cook the most delicious pancakes and cut us fresh fruit. He was always around or close by if we had any questions or needed any recommendations, was very approachable and friendly. A gardener pottered around each day which really shows as the garden is beautiful with various fruits growing. The villa itself is incredible and spacious with 3 big bedrooms, 2 en-suite and last with a bathroom in next room. The upstairs room we stayed in has a balcony we‚Äôd spend the mornings relaxing on and the top floor has a roof terrace where you can watch the sunrise, sunset and the stars! This is where we spent most of our evenings. Villa stayed pretty cool but has aircon throughout incase it gets too hot. The infinity pool is massive with a smaller pool attached both were cleaned daily and well lit for evening swims. Pretty water features. Location was ideal for us as we planned on renting a moped anyway, which the host kindly offered to help with. It‚Äôs just 5 minutes ride into town and easy to get around. It is walkable but quite hilly much better with vehicle. Neighbours very friendly which made us feel welcomed and the Villa is very secured with high walls and lockable gates so we felt very safe. We will most definitely be coming back in the future and recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Lovina. This is the place! Unforgettable experience.","Terrific gated villa up in the hills of Lovina. Large infinity pool, has 3 bedrooms, two which are ensuite. Roof deck with view. Very good Wifi. Tremendous onsite staff who are very helpful. You'll need a car or driver if you stay here though, but the villa can provide. Lots of local color, including frequent gamelan performances outside the walls.",Nice view,Good view

Our room was beautiful and the guest house stunning.  Wonderful breakfasts followed by amazing days.  Maxine and Yanto are amazing hosts and shared and showed us the beautiful North Bali. Thank you ‚Ä¶ hope to be back soon.,"My husband and I stayed there when we had only been dating for a few short months. We stayed in Bali for several weeks but the first week was with Maxine and Yanto. As wild as this may seem, we fell deeply in love with each other that week and continues to grow. Kubu Kusuma will always have a special place in my heart along with Maxine and Yanto. They are two incredible humans who are full of loving-kindness, and compassion. The home is beautifully maintained and landscaped. Very clean and comfortable. Plenty of privacy when we wanted it and intelligent conversation when we felt social. They are excellent hosts and tour guides. I have and will continue to recommend this home to all of my friends thinking about taking a trip to Bali!","Maxine and Suyanto‚Äôs home is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen! This was the first time I have stayed in someone‚Äôs home while they were staying there too, and it was a lovely experience for me and my two girl friends. Our hosts were incredibly open and kind to us. Anything we wanted to do, adventure-wise, they scheduled for us which made things so easy. We rented motor scooters, went on a dolphin excursion, waterfall hike, sunrise volcano hike... and at the end of a long day, their home was perfect to come back to relax! We had a delicious breakfast with the freshest local fruits which was included in our stay, and we even took advantage of having Suyanto, a local from Java, cook for us a few times as well and teach one private cooking class for us. Best food I have ever had! The property is private and we felt incredibly safe. The swimming pool was a nice touch so we could cool off from the Bali heat. I can‚Äôt say enough about how much I enjoyed Maxine, Suyanto, their home, food, and just Bali in general. Thanks again and I hope to return again!",We‚Äôve stayed here twice now. Once in 2019 and once in 2022. This place is very special. Maxine and Suyanto are incredible hosts. Maxine also makes beautiful sea glass jewelry that is very reasonably priced.,"If you are looking for a peaceful paradise in Bali, then you are certainly heading to the right place. Maxine and Yanto make you feel welcomed from the first time you make contact with them.
During our stay in their beautiful home we were made to feel like friends visiting rather than strangers passing through. Our room was large, airy and beautifully presented; the large bathroom spotless and the garden filled with colourful flowers and an amazing pool; perfect for relaxing and recharging. Maxine and Yanto will organise as much or as little as you would like while you are with them. If you or your partner enjoy fishing, the fishing excursion is a must ( I spent the afternoon creating a special piece of jewellery with the talented Maxine while my partner went fishing with Yanto).  If the conditions are right and  you are fortunate enough to catch dinner - a trip to a local warung were your fish is cooked for you is amazing. I can also highly recommend the cooking class.  Yanto openly shares his knowledge, love and passion for all of the amazingly fresh ingredients available from the local market - a trip made even more enjoyable because it is with a local who understands what all the amazing produce is. The finished meal is absolutely delicious and you go away with the knowledge to cook you own tastes of Bali when you return home.
The surrounding area of Lovina is stunning and easily enjoyed either by walking, a scooter ride or in a guided tour with Maxine and Yanto.
I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending a stay with this amazing couple in a beautiful part of Bali."
