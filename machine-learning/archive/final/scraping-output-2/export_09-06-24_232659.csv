Order sate gurita (octopus satay) with tipat (rice cake) served with raon gurita (spicy octopus soup). Savory and spicy satay and hot soup are the best choices for lunch after dives. I will definitely go back!,"Found this nice local eatery when we were heading to Amed from Manggis (with a little detour).

They sold satay with octopus, tuna, barracuda, etc. and soup.

I treid the octopus satay and soup.
The octopus satay is pretty tender with some little bit of chewiness and hints of spices. They gave thick sauce on top and tasted a bit tangy.
The octopus soup was great. The broth is peppery, spicy, and full of spices. The octopus was cooked until tender, and the soup was a perfect match with plain rice or rice cake.

There were ample parking spots across the street.

Recommend to try this local delicacy.",Located on the side of the main street of karangasem-tianyar. Easy to find since this place is the only one who sold octopus skewer and soup. This place is pretty well known by locals and byfar the best octopus skewer in the karangasem region. For some people especially foreigner will find the food is spicy and it is spicy but also delicious and the main reason people always return to eat here. Dont forget to order Es Campur. One of the best.,"Best octopus skewer and soup in town. Have to try when you visit east side of Bali. Perfect grill and not too hard to chew. They also provide fish skewer, but the best is still the octopus. They only accept cash, and stop serving after stock empty. Visit asap because this place way too famous.","The mix soup tuna and gurita was delicious. The sate was subpar and wasnt warm. There was plenty of seatings, but do keep in mine the place is semi outdoor so there‚Äôs quite an amount of flies/ants that will be on your food. but if you are ever in Amed or Tulamben, this is worth a try"
