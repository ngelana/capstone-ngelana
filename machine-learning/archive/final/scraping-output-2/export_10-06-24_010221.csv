The only thing I wish it was better, I stayed when they were upgrading to have more rooms. So there's that. But the rest, It was amazing!! The Staff was amazing and friendly. The room is clean. I booked the one with the private pool and I could bring my dog. And of course, I recommend this place for my friend from USA and she loves it as well","My recent stay at Canggu Green Gate Paradise was far from enjoyable. The hotel was more of a nightmare than a paradise, with constant construction noise starting as early as 7 am each day. The photos online painted a much more appealing picture than the reality I experienced. The cleanliness and upkeep of the facilities left much to be desired, and the dated amenities made for an uncomfortable stay. The inconsistent water pressure and temperature only added to the discomfort. Given the price paid, the value for money was severely lacking. The breakfast was also a letdown. The beds were incredibly uncomfortable, the hair dryer lacked power, and the room lacked basic amenities. To make matters worse, the toilet flooded whenever it rained, and the mosquito nets and soft furnishings were visibly dated and unclean. Overall, I would strongly advise against staying at this hotel.","Lovely place to stay. Very courteous, professional staff. Rooms were clean and well looked after. Pool was clean and pleasant. Right next to a rice field, so sunset is beautiful. Around a 15-20 minute bike to Canggu beach.

The only thing I would say is currently noisy, due to construction next door, but won‚Äôt effect my review","Great place. Value for money! Huge open garden space. Nice dimensions swimming pool. Super clean, very friendly people and quiet. Will definitely come back!","Delighted with that villa, the room was beautiful, clean and very cozy, the people were very kind and friendly. I will return without a doubt. A special thanks to the manager who let us to left our luggage there for some days üòç"

I don‚Äôt know what exactly affected it, but the music really became quieter and so far it hasn‚Äôt bothered me anymore. I want to express my gratitude for this. I hope it will be so. I wish you success.

I appeal to the owners of this establishment. You have absolutely no respect for the place you are in. This place has an incredible atmosphere of silence,  comfort. I don't mind parties as long as they last until 12 midnight. But yours music is loud until 2-3 am. In response to our request to make it at least a little quieter, we received a strict refusal and referred to police permission. But let's use common sense. Your music is not just loud, it's deafening. You're preventing construction workers from resting after a hard day's work, scaring animals, and preventing everyone in the area from sleeping. If you have even a little self-respect, you can find an opportunity to turn down the volume a little. I ask for little, just to make it quieter. Your guests will also be grateful, since this level of noise makes it difficult to communicate and damages the eardrums. I hope for your prudence and understanding üôèüèº","The service was super super nice, the server were all friendly, the waiting time was long because it was freshly made, and you can adjust your spicy level too. I was having fufu (cassava) with egusi (beef) next time I‚Äôd try it with fish. At first the egusi tasted unusual because it was my first time tasting it, took me time to like it, but now I love itüíó cant wait to come back. The price was totally worth it!"

Cosy wooden bungalows in the middle of rice fields. Small pool to cool off, very nicely planted between the bungalows. super comfortable mattress and a fantastic soundscape at night from the rice fields.

Came here for dinner to taste their Thali sets, along with a side of Butter Chicken (and a cheeky Singaraja). Was not disappointed at all, and ended up being a most filling and delicious meal to close the evening.

Pak Made who served me was so kind and attentive, and their pet dogs there were lovely to have for company.

Reasonably priced, plenty of parking for both cars and motorcycles, awesome service, great vibes.","Wow what a feed..... The value for money here is off the chain. And also a nice view to boot. There was no one here when we got here just to arrive at a steep staircase to go upstairs, was greeted by beautiful views of the rice fields. Ordered up, food was quick and wow, butter chicken, saffron rice and naan bread always my favourite combo and a serving of the chicken taquitos. Was delicious!! Just wanted to eat more. Girlfriend wasn't too hungry so just got the juicy chicken tacos and I tried and were delightful. And the best thing about this I the price big portions you will not walk out hungry.

Hosts, Ivan and Katja, are caring, sweet and helpful.
Rooms and pool are clean and guesthouses are true to the balinese style. Coming from the streets noice to this oasis, is like heaven.
You will need some transportation to get around, but even that, Katja og Ivan are helpful with. The place have scooters to rent.

Tanah Lot 15 min. Canggu 20 min.
I can highly recommend this beautiful place.

Wonderful beds and a nice refreshing swimming pool in a beautiful garden. Host Ivan took us twice to take surfing lessons which was really awesome! we have rented motorbikes through them and have been able to explore the beautiful island. We really had a blast, partly due to the good care of the host and hostess. We received many tips and were looked after as if we were friends.

Dubious contact with a little bit lazy owner (Michele, french) who lives at the small property (maybe that is too close?). No introduction or orientation when we arrived. Before bringing us (and luggage) to the room we had to pay cash in Euro. Receipt we got only after double request. If you have any requests (for example we had an problem with the air con) there are only idignant answers or there comes nothing. For example we did ask for surf lessons and they promised to inform us. We never received an answer.

The rice paddies in the area are beautiful but !attention! the farmers work in december is really loud and really disturbs until sunset the whole day. If you stay at the small property (breakfast, pool) and if you need to recover from your stressful job you will get crazy.

The windows are not closable so you need at night eartips due to the unexpected loud nature sounds of rice fields (frogs aso.)

In monsun season some water gets into the bungalow. The bathroom was like a bio hazard after night rain. Bed was also moisty from rain at night.

The beach (dirty & black sand) is at least 15min walk from the bungalows. You can't swim there.

But: nice landscape, nice balinese staff.

Altogether we have to say it is overpriced and the service (not the balinese staff) is bad. We payd 95US$ a night incl. breakfast. You will get a lot more for same money in other places.",This is no longer an accomodation and is privately owned.,Very good villa near by seseh beach,Luxury,Great placeüôèüèª

The in house spice and sauce is out if this world, totally eat here again luckily it‚Äôs near my home and open till late hours","‚ÄúBurger House Bali‚Äù is a recently developed establishment but their food making skills seem to have been honed a over century. A beam of light in this star is the dessert, the ‚ÄúHomemade Snickers,‚Äù as they have a nutty,  chocolatey flavour that explodes in your mouth. Yet another stand out is the ‚ÄúHouse Cheese Burger‚Äù as it‚Äôs juicy patty would put any others to shame. The wait staff were fabulous and the food was cooked quickly and properly leading a great dining experience.","Tried the single truffle mayo burger, and while the taste is good, the patty is very thin and way too small for the bun (or maybe bun is too big?). The burger did come with a side of fries, so for the price can‚Äôt complain too much.. The cauliflower popcorn however was drenched in sauce and not as crispy as one would expect. That said staff was super friendly and preparation time super fast!","My perpetual enjoyment of this fine establishment is enforced through its delicious food, extravagant staff and wide variety, which can be suited to any array of western tastes. The spectrum of food goes from the delicious popcorn cauliflower, all the way to the spicy chicken burger, and further to the range of vegan options.

She looked at us and I will never forget her expression. She spit on the ground in front of us and screamed: ,,NO! BULE!''. Which means ,,No! Foreigners!''
