The atmosphere of the hotel is simply amazing from the moment you step in. And the views of the mountain is stunning.

The ambience of Sun Suko is wonderfully calm and quite. The rooms is very unique and common areas are impeccably clean.

One of the highlights of my stay was the friendly and accommodating staff. They went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of my visit was perfect, always ready with a warm smile and helpful advice.

Overall, Sun Suko is a perfect retreat for those seeking peace. Highly recommended!!

Can't wait to go back there.

Ciao","We booked this place for two nights after arriving onto Bali from Java, mainly to break up our journey and do a nearby scuba dive, but ended up extending our stay twice.

It‚Äôs a cute place, with some great design (our room was dragon themed, and had lots of well thought out details - we especially loved the doors, and the semi-outside bathroom!), a brilliant pool area, lovely in-house massages (250k), and a great restaurant serving smoothies, salads, and tasty Asian food. There are two yoga studios that are free to use (played a YouTube class on my laptop), one is air conditioned, and I think you could book an instructor. There is unlimited free mineral water in reusable bottles, a nice touch. The staff are incredibly lovely and friendly, and welcomed us with a delicious cocktail.

The location is good. Quiet and rural, meaning it is tranquil, but just a short walk to the main drag down a lane with local houses. It‚Äôs a stones throw from Warung De‚ÄôLekong, a fabulous local place for dinner.

Overall, this was a superb place to have a relaxing retreat, at half the price of somewhere of equivalent luxury further south, and we were really very sad to leave!","Returning to Sun Suko boutique hotel in Pemuteran, Bali feels like coming home. This is my second stay here, and I already can't wait to plan my next visit. The attentive staff, led by the gracious hostess Anja, creates a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere that instantly puts you at ease. The cuisine is not only delicious but also diverse and nourishing, catering to various tastes and dietary needs.

Each room is a masterpiece of artistry, providing a serene and comfortable retreat after a day of exploration. The massages offered here are truly exceptional, melting away any tension and leaving you feeling rejuvenated. With the beautiful sea nearby and bicycles available for leisurely rides, there's no shortage of ways to immerse yourself in the natural beauty of Bali.

For diving enthusiasts, there are fantastic dive spots nearby waiting to be explored. Whether you're seeking adventure or tranquility, Sun Suko offers the perfect sanctuary. It's truly the ultimate retreat destination, where every moment feels like a dream come true.","What a great place to stay! Very authentic, familiar and sustainable. You feel very comfortable and you will find everything you need for a relaxing vacation in the north of Bali.
Thanks to the teamüåû","Heaven! If you are looking to get away from the hustle of life and be surrounded by peace and nature then this is the place. The rooms are all so unique and well looked after. The wonderful staff are truly what makes this place so special, and this is saying a lot as there are insanely beautiful mountains outside your window and then the beach at the other end of the street. A true relaxing, real, authentic, loving, Bali experience. I can't wait to come back!!"

Thanks Kadek, Putu and Ilou for everything ! üôèüèº I will come back again and again !","Absolutely wonderful guesthouse to stay. The room and bathroom were clean and spacious. The breakfast and other meals were excellent and good portions and the service from the staff was top tier. The pool was also excellent, deep at one end and shallow at the other. The hospitality of the staff and the other locals was the best we experienced in the 3 weeks we'd been in Bali. I would stay here again in the future.",We had a great time at Mango Moon. The staff is very kind in accommodating earlier breakfast as we were going snorkeling and needed to leave early. The hotel has a nice indoor garden and a nice pool. The beach is 10 mins away,"I had a great experience staying in Mango Moon. The hostess, Pudu, is a lovely sweet woman that prepares amazingly delicious fluffly pancakes for breakfast. The garden of the property is lush and the pool works very well. Beds are comfortable! I highly recommend.","We stayed 2 weeks in this wonderful place! The room was spacious, clean and cozy. I loved the territory of the guest house: the swimming pool and arbors. The breakfast was tasty, people around were kind and helpful."

So clean villa, amazing garden, perfect service, delicious breakfast, a lot of spot for relax and chill, big and nice swimming pool, friendly staff! A lot of attention to details, so nice and stylish interior , beautiful decor. Thank you so much for our perfect time in Pemuteran! üôèüèª","Great location. Staff were very accommodating and the villa itself was clean and spacious. The air con was leaking and they staff tried to rectify it while we were there but they informed us it would take a few days to sort the problem out which we were fine with. These things happen and they tried their best to solve it. We complained about the flies and they immediately bought a new fan in and set it up at the dining table. From driving us around to ordering and delivering food for us, they were fantastic right from the get go.","The perfect holiday for a couple.
The house and its garden could easily accommodate up to 10 guests.
Our villa had 2 bedrooms and would be perfect for two couples.
The staff is as discreet as efficient. They come daily to clean the house, take your laundry and maintain the garden and swimming pool. On demand the cooking ladies will come to prepare and serve breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The villa - already a place you won't want to ever leave - is surrounded by colorful trees. In the back of the villa, stunning view of the mountains.
Should you need anything, from a shuttle to or from town, a bag of ice for your drinks, the Site Manager, Selamat, will have left you a phone the day of your arrival. One call and he will promptly accommodate any demand.

I have nothing bad to say about Jeda Villa. Already planning our next visit to this paradise where everything can be taken care of for you.

The perfect location if you are looking for a secluded villa in a town without too many tourists or noise. Perfect staff. Perfect service.","My husband and I stayed there when we attended a retreat which included yoga and self-improvement techniques.  One of the main reasons for choosing the retreat was the location.  Jeda Villa is beautiful, it's everything it promises to be, relaxing, breathtaking views and wonderful food and service.  Jenny the manager arranged everything we wanted, massages, trips to the beach (not that we ever left the property - it was just too nice) and if there were any issues they were taken care of promptly.  If anyone wants to get away from it all, this is the play to go.","Pure bliss. The photos don't even do this place justice. You won't ever want to leave.  It is a piece of heaven, with every comfort you could want. Comfortable beds,  no mosquitos, delicious food,  massages,  sublime pool,  daybeds galore,  yoga studio, warm breeze,  and sounds of roosters and chanting... It is a truly magical experience."

On a chilled back lane away from all the traffic, Warung De'Lekong serves absolutely delicious food. The best we've had in Indonesia! The prices are very reasonable and the portions large. Great cocktails too! The service is amazing and the food so beautifully presented. The family who run the place are lovely and we enjoyed chatting with them. There are lots of Warungs with 4.8 or 4.9 stars in Pemuteran but this one is so much better than any of the others we tried. We ate there many times and also did their cooking course which was great fun! Thank you üôè","Best place in Bali that we found in 2 weeks of our travel around the island. The food quality is great, the portions are bigger than in other places and the cocktails are perfectly mixed. Juices are really fresh and tasty. Presentation is so unique and esthetic. The service is like in a 5 star hotel. Really  impressive after traveling for 2 weeks and trying to find a decent place to eat which is really hard to find in the other parts of the island.","We have eaten in lots of Warungs on Bali so far and most of them served very tasty food, but this Warung is just extraordinary! You can taste the freshness of the products, the care for the customer and the love for cooking in every single bite (and sip when it comes to the fresh juices).
Also the presentation deserves a comment - it's basically art on the plate.
The Warung is situated inbetween fields, far from the noise and the car emissions of the main road - you can just sit back, take in the atmosphere and enjoy the marvelous food and drinks.","If I could give 6 stars, I would!!
While browsing google maps, in search of restaurants to visit during my stay, I came across this gem. Tucked away in a side street, pretty far back from the main road.
This small Warung is run by some of the kindest people in the world. So welcoming, interested in your story and wanting to provide you the best food and service possible.
I had homemade spring rolls to start. They were covered in a homemade sweet and sour sauce with pineapple and onions and oh my gosh was this delicious. A great start.
Then I had the daily special of fresh Mahi Mahi with butter and garlic sauce and a side of vegetables and potatoes. I have been traveling for 3 months and this is the BEST meal I have had during this time!!
To finish it off the lovely waitress recommended I try their homemade Dadar Gulung and that was a perfect finish to a fantastic dinner.

Be sure to go out of your way and give these great people a visit. There is no way you will be disappointed! Thank you so much for the fantastic evening.","Wow. As an Indonesian, I can tell good Indonesian food vs mediocre ones.

Warung De'Lekong is one of the best Balinese restaurants out here!

Pepes Ikan - the fish was super fresh, the vegetables were tasty, and the sambal matah was balanced (although not spicy at all)

Dadar Gulung - They have hit the mark! Not too much coconut, yet not too much sugar.

Absolutely one of the best places to eat in Bali. Not too mention the service was attentive and friendly.

I'll come back again for the remainder of my trip here.

Thank you!"
