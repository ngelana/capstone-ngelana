Best family, so welcoming and caring. Conveniently located near national park and near the main road. Must visit the nearby Pura Sakti temple, hot springs and white sand beaches. Rooms are very clean and very nicely decorated, with beautiful sit out space and amazing garden. Thank you 🙏🏽","We booked 1 night but stayed for 2.  The room was very cozy and atmospheric, bright and clean.  very beautiful bathroom with live plants.  the room had air conditioning, hot water and Wi-Fi, there was also drinking water.  the host family was very nice, they prepared a delicious breakfast for us and offered various excursions.  on the territory there is a small garden where you can do yoga among different plants and in general the territory is very beautiful, well-groomed and atmospheric.  thank you very much to these wonderful people for the days spent with them 🙏🏻👏😊","Eventhough it”s a room and lil bit noisy from the main road but i could not Find better place Like this. My FAVO homey homestay in this area. Super Clean room, safe and good quality of matras. The semi outdoor shower room also Clean, No odor n fresh water & air. I got more than i paid here. The hospitality is top notch. Ketut and His family so genuine and treat the guests Like His own family. As they lived at the next door, they creates the real Balinese culture, oftenly they offered free food and eating with their family. Have a look the back yard as he own vineyard and small farm (pigs, cows and roasters) HE also provides scooter rent and transport service (pick up from AirPort  with His car) what a wonderful Experiences tO stay here, highly recomended ❤️❤️❤️❤️","Ketut Sarka is an amazing host, in the corner of his lovely house, he has these two beautiful rooms. You get the chance to see the real Bali, to eat with his family, and to see the traditional Balinese culture.","Very clean and spacious room and an idyllic outside bathroom. The owner is very friendly and helpful with arranging trips and transport. The AC works great. The homemade nasi goreng is wonderful. The only downside is that there was some noise from the road, some dogs and the lovely chickens in the yard.

It’s the first review we write because we highly recommend this place when visiting the area for snorkelling or hiking."
