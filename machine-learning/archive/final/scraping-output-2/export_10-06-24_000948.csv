The place is very not crowded and hard to see from the street. For hot spring number 5 and 6 the place is very very much open space and people can see you from outside ( concerning , but the outside pathway , pretty much no one went there )

Access to go here is hard and far from city area. You need to navigate to spaghetti road , go around and around, and eventually arrived. It took around 1.40 hours from north kuta.

Seriously, i feels like entering a pee pool with this heat , it's not hot enough. The water smells like well water (expected, but tolerable). A little bit green. Overall, mildly disappointed.","Rustic, private and quiet. Just perfect for couples if you get there early. Pools 1-4 are hottest. Cost 70k per tourist. We loved it",One of the closer hot spring places to Canggu. They quoted me 50k for private and 25k for open pool which is outside of the property in the jungle creek. The water is pumped to private suites via giant pool. Locals don't come here as it's indeed overpriced.,"5 stars. First it's not dirty, it's sulfur, darlin. The place,it's really amazing. Surrounded by nice garde. The price is ok. 50k/person/hours.dont complain too much.for evything you got, and also, the maintenance, the workers, they also need to be well paid","The forest is amazing and hot water is nice but it's dirty. Cant see the bottom. 1 star because my wife paid 20k and I had to pay 50k even if Im local. The skin color determines the price and that is racist! Its racist to have prices that are based on skin color. So no, would not reccomend to any of ny friends."

But the price is to expensive for local, as most of the customer is local so it would be nice if they can change the price at their restaurant","bad service, not friendly, it is forbidden to bring food from outside, the price of the food sold there is too expensive,",Very bad welcoming !! Very bad people . First time I met Indonesian people like that and I live here part of the year . We went in another place and understand why it is empty !!!,"Over price definitely 50k for 1h no chance, I will not be back",Great place for soaking. Stay calm in nice river and pick one of tge many pools if you want the heat. Infinity pool is definitely nice for pictures. Lots of birds around!

It‚Äôs a perfect place to slow down, reflect, meditate and just be.

The private hot spring under the stars ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®It felt unreal. Fireflies flying around while bathing. Felt like something out of avatar movie.

It‚Äôs a bit out there but I wanted to stay away from tourist spots. There is s local night food market nearby after 5 pm and the cheapest tastiesr durians in May.","Stayed at the Green Guru Hot Spring and had a great time. It is a very calm, relaxing and undisturbed environment. The hot spring was a perfect 42 degrees‚ÄôC and left me feeling re-energized. I would highly recommend a visit!",This place is exoticüòç.

We loved our stay with Wisnu and his family. We stayed with him after booking his other property Balepanjang and deciding it was best to stay here. Went to the Bali Silent Retreat for two day passes and it was perfect!!!! 100% recommended :),"We booked in here to be close to the bali silent retreat.The room was $25 a night for  2 people and was  very small room with a double bed.Bathroom was next door. As we needed twin beds Wisnu  who was a lovely kind person,gave us an additional room for the same price.It would be nice if the bed had a sheet on it instead of a blanket.There was a small fan, a kitchen to make a coffee and a fridge to use.We were there for one hour and went and visited the hotsprings .After seeing the yeh panas hotspring resort room for $50 we changed our minds and left and Wisnu accepted the full $25 for our one hour stay.I think it will be the easiest $25 he has ever made!",Nice experience I like it I Preferred the private.,Top,
