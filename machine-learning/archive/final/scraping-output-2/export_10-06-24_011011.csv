The view from the window was stunning, overlooking the beautiful city skyline.

One of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's dining options. The breakfast buffet was extensive, with a wide variety of fresh and delicious choices. I also dined at the hotel restaurant for dinner, and the food was exceptional. The service in the restaurant was top-notch, with the staff being both knowledgeable and friendly.","Hotel Prama offers an excellent stay with luxurious rooms, outstanding service, and top-notch amenities. The spacious, clean rooms feature comfortable beds, modern amenities, and high-quality toiletries. The staff is professional and friendly, ensuring a smooth check-in process. Dining options are diverse and delicious, with a wide breakfast buffet and exquisite restaurant meals. The hotel’s prime location makes it convenient for exploring the city. Overall, Hotel Prama provides a memorable and superior hotel experience. Highly recommended!","I had an amazing stay at this hotel! The staff were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. The rooms were spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. The amenities were top-notch, especially the pool and fitness center. The location was perfect, close to major attractions and public transportation. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great experience.","Wonderful accommodation for a great price, the resort grounds were beautiful and extremely well maintained,  the room was immaculately clean and the views of Sanur Beach were spectacular from our balcony. There are multiple lifts to choose from for easy accessibility to all amenities, the pool was huge and well maintained and the buffet breakfast was delicious with a huge selection to choose from. The location was great with plenty of shops and cafes/restaurants within walking distance and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  I will be back again and highly recommend The Prama to everyone.","I went with my family to Prama Sanur and it had everything we needed! Rooms were spacious and staff were attentive to our requests. We appreciated the variety of restaurants they had on-site (the Italian one of the beachfront was a favorite) so it didn’t get tiring. The live band on the beach near to Bamboo Bar was also a plus to the ambiance. Best of all, it’s located on the beachfront of a more quiet and calm part of Sanur. Lots of things to see and do within walking distance. Highly recommend them also for events!"

Checking in was great and we were thankful to get into our room early.
We had booked our accommodation through Scoopon (Luxury Escapes). We had booked 2 rooms due to the size of our family, unfortunately these were not able to be interconnected, which would have been nice to have been notified of this prior to booking. We made do!
What I was disappointed with was the attitude and friendliness of some of the hospitality staff. We were meant to have 2x dinners included in our package. We decided to use one of the included dinners on our first night. We arrived at the restaurant at 6pm, there was no one around except the hostess. She seemed annoyed at us for coming there for dinner! We were shown a very small limited menu that we were able to choose from, which was just okay… I asked to look at a drinks menu, this seemed like another inconvenience! I then asked to order drinks and she said, no, I take your meal order first. To be honest she was quite rude and I was really taken aback.
We also had cocktails included, instead of a normal/popular cocktail list, they were very basic, unimaginative cocktails! I was quite disappointed.
Staff in general seemed quite unhappy and I really wonder about the management and the way they are treated.
Our housekeeping staff were great, very happy with their service and friendliness.
Rooms are very tired and worn and I do understand it is not a 5 star hotel. Unfortunately the water pressure was very poor to our upstairs room and on some instances we had no hot water.
I loved the location on the beach and the overall appearance of the grounds is lovely. Kids also had a great time in the big pool.
I think there are better options in Sanur and we will stay somewhere else next time.","The gardens throughout the resort are so beautiful and there's a real tranquil feel. Everyone is always so friendly. The pools are nice and plenty of chairs and lounges. Cocktails and other drinks are delicious, although slightly pricey (but expected in a resort).
We had to ask a couple of times to get an extra sheet, towel and bin for our 2 year old but other than that, service is good.","The service from the front office/receptionist to room service is friendly and satisfying. The facilities are complete and good, especially the swimming pool.
The location is very strategic, in the afternoon you can play on the beach and the sunset is also very eye-catching with a really good view that spoils the eyes. The food at breakfast is all delicious and varied.","We didn’t stay at the resort but came in for the seafood banquet. This was advertised as being available from 6:00 to 9:00pm, however when we arrived at 7:00pm we only got remnants of the food. Balinese dancing was very good but just a bit disappointed about the food. I would advise to get there early!","A breathtaking experience in Mercure. The location is absolutely top notch. They have a private beach area. Although the beach is not good for swimming, but you can relax and soak the sun in plenty.

The resort is so big that we couldn't see all it's parts. There are two pools which are well maintained. Although we couldn't find the showers in Sahadewa pool so couldn't dip.

The food options need improvements with more vegetarian options.

I dint have breakfast so can't comment on that

The staff is absolutely lovely. They greet you with genuine smile everytime. They epitomize Bali people in general. Will surely visit again when I need a hotel in South Bali."

I enjoyed 2 1/2 hour worth of treatments. I was in a giddy state of bliss afterward.","Great location, standard rooms are a bit dated but still nice. Newer exec premium rooms are nice and spacious with good bathrooms and a great communal pool.
Food is ok/good, buffet breakfast is 5/10 and dinner has improved from years gone by (been staying at this hotel for many years now).
Great pools and beach access for kids and close proximity to shops and cafes.","The location is perfect, the hotel looks amazing. The bathroom could do with a good clean to get rid of the mould in areas.
Pools and gardens are beautiful and well maintained.
Service was very good if not a bit slow at times but always with a smile.
Big let down was the beach, you can't stop nature bringing in seaweed but it came with so much rubbish and not cleaned up at all in time we were there.
Not just this hotel but all businesses along the beach front should maintain the beaches and keep them clean.","The scenery at the hotel is really stunning, with mature indigenous trees, serious attention to the grounds, and plentiful Hindu Statues to accent Balinese culture. The hotel attracts mature Europeans and Aussies, perhaps groups. I traveled alone and I do think your vibe and the vibe of the guests that  a hotel attracts does matter. The staff overall attended to any concerns I had with care and consideration. The rooms are truly lovely, and I recommend the premier deluxe, second or third floor. Lots of closet and drawer space! The coffee is excellent too. One staff member that stands out was Sonia.  She provided advice prior to my stay, and continued to guide me from arrival to departure. Sanur has gotten very busy especially at night, so having a nice room was very appreciated.","Puri Santrian is a fantastic resort.
We had a couple of teething issues on the first day and the resort staff solved them as quickly and painlessly as they could. Highly commend them for how they handled themselves and us!
Great breakfast buffet, excellent meals
from the restaurant and great coffee. Really great coffee.
Thankyou"

They have really nice vibes, casual and relaxed setup and offer a wide range of traditional western breakfast, lunch and dinner items. Prices similar to what you find at other eateries along the promenade that runs the length of the Sanur beachfront area.

We had lunch here during our recent stay in Sanur. Pepperoni pizza was decent. Crust a bit softer than we like, probably could have used another couple minutes in the oven. Cheese, tomato sauce and pepperoni toppings were alright. Buddha bowl was a nice green dish with fresh veg and tempeh. We also liked the chocolate brownie dessert.","Our fav spot to dine in Sanur! Fresh, tasty, good quality food and friendly service. We love that they cater to all requirements and have many vegetarian and vegan options. Beautiful location and very chilled out.","Part of Mercury, I believe… but at sunset time is a bit undersatffed and yup you have to wait to be seated or waited for food. Quite surprised it had a high rating. Food is okay. Happy hour for beer is just Bali Hai, nothing special at all.","I like being here and working on the computer all day.

In the evening you can sit outside on the beach and enjoy the dusk.

They have normal and fast WiFi. For the faster one you have to ask.",Chilled beach cafe with amazing quality food. Away from the crowds and big hotels further up Sanur beach. Loved the cool sea breeze and live music in the evening. Falafel bowl amazing.

Only 1 water drinking station and a weird signing out and in of pool towels from reception to your room?Gives a really stingy feel to the hotel, no one wants to steal a second hand pool towel. Just make a pile for people to use. I think there is a lot better to use in the surrounding area. It is in a nice location though",Hotel and staff great except for motorbike 🛵 in morning and lat at night. Breakfast was actually good for a hotel but dinner was not.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at this hotel, and I must say it exceeded my expectations in every way. The ambiance was delightful, and my room was not only comfortable but also tastefully decorated.

From the moment I checked in, the employees were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to ensure I had a pleasant stay. Their attentiveness and willingness to assist with any request made me feel truly valued as a guest.

The hotel's amenities were top-notch, and the attention to detail in maintaining cleanliness was evident throughout. The complimentary breakfast was a delightful start to each day, featuring a variety of options to suit every taste.

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a memorable and enjoyable stay. Kudos to the staff for their exceptional hospitality—I will definitely be returning on my next visit to the area!","Rooms are big, with nice working area, big bed, nice ensuite bathroom, with strong shower, all kept clean, with plenty of hanging space plus a laptop size safe.

The flip side is the smell of kitchens nearby which sometimes can be smelt inside the room - just ensure your room at the front or left side. The front door locking system is very annoying",Nice hotel with pleasant helpful staff. Loved their breakfast. Rooms are spacious. Hugh double bed!

Great hotel, I’d stay again here if I’m in Sanur.",What a wonderful experience. We stayed at this resort in Sanur for five days and couldn’t fault it. The staff were so obliging and polite. We had a cookery class which was good fun and the meal was delicious. We also had a Bali massage which was simply wonderful. The hotel is beautifully furnished and very clean. The grounds and swimming pool lovely. We highly recommend this resort and would love to stay again.,Absolutely exceeds all expectations. Room was amazing! The staff is so nice and goes over the top to do whatever they can to help. We love all the special touches they do throughout the stay. It was very nice to be pampered for a few days. The pool is very nice. The yoga studio in the spa is very cute. The on-site restaurant is also so amazing. All the food we had here was very good. They have good things for everything from snacks to dessert!,"Perfect place for those looking for a peaceful place with traditional Balinese vibe and a hint of colonial touch. The service is great, they were even very accommodative to my elderly family members.
Its also a great value, for what you get I think the price is on the lower side.",We did not like the hotel. The rooms were not clean. The bathroom was super dirty and smelled bad. The bedsheets were dirty and had blood on them. The room we stayed in has a hide headboard attached to the bed and when walking to the bathroom I hurt my toe very badly because it’s dangerously placed. Not safe for children especially.

More items on menu to try next visit before I go home,"Quiet descent Vietnamese food. Noodles, broken rice, rolls. They have 3 diff size bowls for noodles. Prep time is standard. Walking distance from Hyatt Regency Hotel Sanur. Place is clean, quiet (not noisy) and easy to find.",One of my favorite restaurant in Sanur! My favorite menu is BM Pork n springroll! But all the foods taste good.,"Sadly the quality of this place has gone down in Sanur. The last time I was there the staff forgot my drink after 2 reminders and still tried to charge me . Most recently the pho was way off from the photo. The broth was good but the meat was nothing as advertised. We complained and we weren't charged which is appreciated. This was a day after Nyepi which is more or less understandable if supplies are low but if you dont have the proper inventory dont tried to sell a halfbaked version of the menu. Also the same bowl of pho had a large thick strand of hair. To the owner, stay on top of your staff because they are impacting your businesses negatively for customers who live in Bali and come often."

Please clean the room properly and help with  mosquitoes","Location is really good, room is clean but bathroom had a smell so wher couldn't turn the lights off or the fan in the bathroom would stop working and the smell would get worse.

We had a room facing over other roof tops so not the best view but didn't spoil the stay. It is an older very balinese hotel and the breakfast is simple but different options and tasty.

The pool was nice and relaxing area.
The prices for drinks were very good and i like that tax is included in the menu. Food was average but good for the price. Nice musician in the evenings.
Hot water fir showers was good but took time to heat up.

HOWEVER: the bed was quiet springy and old.
Absolutely no hairdryer available the whole 3 night stay which is unacceptable.
No free refillable filtered water (hostel even provides this), you are given two tiny bottles on cleaning in the morning though.
There is no kettle in the room either.
Breakfast was average with not very nice coffee.

All in all, I expected more but it was okay","Overall okay. Nice area with good food and live music, short walk to the beach (about 10 min). The center of Sanur is a bit far.
The place feels old and lacks of charm. The towels are of not very good quality. The staff is nice but a bit disorganised and struggling to pass information about each other. Housekeeping was great though."

But the taste isn't so good, thr chicken has too many nuts instead the meat and the pork quite good but too much mala spice and sweet.

Particularly the zhong dumplings, but even moreso their dumpling sauces! I have always asked for extra sauces because of how good it is (and that type of sauce specific to Chengdu dumplings is rather difficult to find anywhere else).

I recommend their wontons as well, the soup is really good! Upon arriving you are given simple refreshments consisting of tea and a small bowl of peanut. A bit of a downside is that they don't serve the mooncakes onsite (3 days preorder required) but still puts it on the menu. Would love some indication that it is a ""preorder"" on the system so it's crystal clear for us before we place an order. Hence for dessert, I recommend peach gums! Peach gums portion is small but it's always good as I've gotten it a few times.

The place itself is very comfortable with tasteful decor. I've been here a few times throughout the year and have also ordered from Grab many times. At the moment for some reason their Grab is often marked closed despite the restaurant itself being open - would appreciate it if there is more clarity on this, as I often ordered through the online app. Prices are also reasonable for this quality and authenticity of food and teas they serve. Definitely worth it making the trip to Sanur. Please keep up the good work and the quality, loved coming here! :)","Been eyeening this resto for sometimes, finally try it today. I don't expect much, yet I was surprised with the service and food. I ordered pork and shimpr wonton and seaweed salad. Both are great taste. But for local, I might suggest adding soy sauce for the wonton soup. Yet overall its a must try resto should you around sanur. Its 10000/10! ! ! !!

Ohh ya, they also gave out free nuts, Chinese veggie pickelled and free chinesse tea.",Finally found an authentic Chinese restaurant in bali. The food taste exactly like how it is in china.

Staff & pool is great. If U can't climb stairs you'll need a 2b/r which is on the ground floor but there's only 4 of them. There's a few warungs in the area you can walk to. Otherwise get the shuttle into town & a taxi back. Food is OK but not memorable.
Shoes as a 2* on the map.","Hospitality industry is often defined by the people managing the facility rather than the physical entities making up the place of stay.  This seems to be have been very well understood by the people taking care of the KARMA ROYAL SANUR resort. Frankly speaking, this is a very modest resort with limited nunber of rooms, which too are just fine for the stay of two people. But what makes the stay in this resort special is the way you are taken care by the staff in a very discrete elegant way. The place is kept very neat and tidy and a lot of attention is given to preserve the environment. Morning breakfast is just like the way you would have it in your home and you are not intimidated by myriad choices.
We used the resort taxi with guide for local travelling and again full marks to the quality of service, that too without burdening your pocket.
I would love to visit this place sometime again.","Great hotel. Had all the amenities. Food variety was average, but what they had was always served perfectly.
Being right on the highway, it was a bit loud with bikes and trucks all the time, but not a deal breaker.
The staff were amazing! I cannot say enough nice things about the staff!","This is par of a time share commitment that I made ten years ago and have continued to be disappointed at the value I have received.
Having said that, although most Karma time shares are 3 star trying to be 5 star The staff at Karma Sanur are the 5 star component. If you are looking for a quiet get away in a boutique atmosphere then this is it. If you want the beach and all that comes with it, this is NOT it. Fortunately, we were looking for the quiet get away.   The location is probably not the best but there are good restaurants nearby. You will have to cross the road of death to get to some of them.  Food in the Karma resort was good, although the provided breakfast had the occasional disappointment you can choose, as we did, to pay a little more and have the breakfast of your choice. The chef is good and will cook up your desired meal. The bar/restaurant staff are also very good and will provide a good selection of drinks. Again they will do everything to mix up the concoction of your choice. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable and when you go for breakfast the magic room fairy comes in and leaves it ""as new"". All the staff are just wonderful and exceptional. They definitely make the place. Would I go back to stay....? Probably not BUT I will drop in to visit and say hello to a wonderful bunch of people and have a meal.","Good clean decent rooms with small pool but elegantly designed. Direct access to main highway, no elevators so that's a bummer. Overall good. Standard breakfast with toast and fruit."

The room is big, clean, and very good shower. Bar noise was LOUD inside my room until 2 a.m., all 5 nights I stayed. No other rooms available they said. You definitely need earplugs!!
Breakfast was extremely disappointing for the room price. 80% of what was served at the buffet was Indonesian options and remained mostly untouched by other guests I noticed. Their "" bacon"" sits in 1 1/2"" of grease!  I asked to have some heated up and was told "" this is how we serve it "". Cold. The female servers at breakfast are friendly and helpful. The male server is grumpy to me,probablyy because I asked him to heat up the ""bacon"".
There are no heated serving containers at all for any of the breakfast dishes served. Everything is served cold. (Except eggs made to order and toast you make yourself.) . Even baby pancakes used to refill the main container were completely cold coming out of the kitchen. Very surprised by that.
I used their bicycles to go to the beach daily. They had 7 available. Ivride a bike at home frequently. Of their 5 bikes I tried, only 2 had baskets or racks to carry your belongings. All were in extremely rough shape and brakes were lacking completely on 3 of the 5. Two had wobbly handlebars. They are not maintained at all. None of the 5 felt safe and I would not go uptown with them where there would be more traffic. The lane to the beach has no cars and few motorbikes.
Overall, knowing what other options are available in Sanur, for the room fee they charge here, I definitely expected a higher standard than they provided.
Pool has no shade, not even an umbrella. I would not pay this price again for this quality while so many other great hotels provide better for much cheaper.","The rooms were affordable. The bathroom is spacious, but has no counter space. There are two pools, a smaller one and bigger one. Breakfast is outside by the larger pool. Buffet breakfast included local and western foods and you can have eggs made to your liking. The staff was nice.",Excessively loud music outside playing until 0200 am (must have finally fallen asleep) in the morning. Had ear plugs and headphones on and it still didn’t drown out the sound. Night mare. Same again tonight 2100 still playing. Omg!!!!!! I just want peace. Do not bother stating here.,"Good location, nice pool, and green garden but the rest is very mediocre. We stayed one night and at the morning of check-out the rooms had no running water.. very inconvenient","Great location for an easy level (10 mins) walk to the beach & many restaurants. First room they gave me was awful, very mouldy, smelly & dark. I said I wouldn’t stay & was then moved to a lovely bright clean room but had to pay more for it & it was noisy during the time the live music in nearby restaurants played til around 10.30 pm.
Staff were lovely. Breakfast was a standard buffet & nothing special but adequate. If I was to stay there again I’d definitely ask for one of the newer rooms around the back side. Pool & gardens were lovely."

Food is good, hv variety of dishes. Staff are friendly and attentive. Love the atmosphere.","The service was excellent, the staff very attentive to your needs. The quality of the food was very poor. For the same price, just north from there is Pier 8 which is much better quality. The entertainment was very amusing with the singer not knowing all the words. His substitution of some lyrics had us in stitches. I'd love to watch a singer actually do this on purpose to create a superb comedy experiance","Can’t knock the location - lovely, comfortable seating looking right at the beach. Drinks were quickly served but in plastic glasses - yuck! Attentive staff but not especially friendly. It was okay but given the prices there are better, less glamorous places to drink. Sorry!","Had pizza and coconut here🥳
They had wooden pizza although not that kind of pizza that I expected but it’s still good tho .
Lovely place and friendly staffs",This bar and cafe is located inside Prama Hotel in Sanur. We ordered pizza margherita and spaghetti aglio olio. The serving time of the menu is ok. The pizza is good but their aglio olio is need improvement. The taste of it was very bland but the spaghetti is well cooked.

This is something special. My husband had the scallops as an entree and I had the arochini. The presentation and taste was amazing. For our main course my husband had the local fish which had a lovely delicate taste. I had ribs which was also tasty. Apart from the food being outstanding the staff both on the floor and in the kitchen were very professional, polite and loved the uniform and styling of the whole place. Thank you for an enjoyable evening we will be back.","Perfect spot for a romantic seaside dinner! The attention to detail at this beachside restaurant is truly impressive. The food was beyond phenomenal, with both the pizza and mains leaving us nothing but impressed. We're already planning a return visit to explore more of the menu; there are so many enticing options that caught our eye. A definite go-to for anyone looking for a delightful dining experience by the beach.","This place is nicely set on the beach with bean bags and tables low enough for your cocktails and wine. This makes for a beautiful sundowner setting.

Our tapas platter was delicious and over all we had an amazing time.","Lovely dinner here.
Live music was a plus.
Staff are great!
We had fish & prawn dishes and enjoyed them both.
Nice cocktail menu.
Would return.
Gorgeous at sunset.","It was the best breakfast! The best avo toast not even in Sanur, but in whole Bali, I swear! At the most of the places avocado is bitter(not good quality type of avo, the cheapest one), but this one is just perfect - creamy and walnut taste! Coffee is definitely one of the best I tried in my life. Service is better than most 5 star restos in Bali. It’s very high level place! And very clean and beautiful as well."

Great coffee aswell If you love Italian food this is a MUST!,"If you want to know if an Italian restaurant is genuine, you order a Spagetti Carbonara. If that is good with no cream, you can trust the rest is wonderful. Just order a steak you find nowhere else in Sanur. This restaurant is great 👍 ! I just hope they survive all ""Cheep Charlies""","This was our absolute favourite place to have breakfast in Bali. The coffee was the best I've had in my life. The breakfast options generous...everything so fresh and delicious. We came back several times and our favourites were the Fungi Farm Fresh Eggs and the Gladitore breakfast. As well as the delicious fruitplate and cheesecake for dessert. Next trip to Sanur, we'll base our choice of accommodation on it's proximity to this restaurant. Located in a nice quiet part of Sanur but also an easy walk to the beach :)","The burrata pizza and salad at this restaurant left a lasting impression on me! The burrata pizza was perfectly cooked with that creamy center and topped with some fresh ingredients, while the salad was refreshing and light. The service was also excellent and the ambiance was relaxing. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a delicious meal! The burrata pizza and salad are a must-try at this restaurant!","One of our favourites on a recent Sanur trip.
It’s set back from the road a bit so easily missed.
Very pretty setting with a fish pond. Friendly service.
The food is delicious and fresh. Burrata pizza algio e olio pasta and caprese all 5 stars.
The coffee/pastry area is air con.
They make a mean espresso martini too!
Bottleshop right next door if you want wine (100k corkage) however they also have a full beverage list.
This one is on our must return list."

They have a large outdoor seating area and offer a fairly wide menu of Indonesian and seafood dishes.

We had two dinners here, very much enjoying their grilled fish on both occasions. Service was friendly and as timely as is reasonable for popular and busy restaurants. Environs on the beach really nice.

During our meals, we had grilled Mahi Mahi X 2, Dory and the Barramundi. All orders were fresh, grilled very nicely, served with a parmesan cream sauce as well as potato and veg. Just great grilled fish, prompting a second meal here. Lumpia served during second meal was just fine.

Will specifically target returning to Retro Beach Restaurant for more grilled fish the next time we are in Sanur.","Excellent location, right on the beach. Awesome breeze in the heat. Really good satay and Indo dishes. Very reasonable prices. Beers/drinks always at decent prices even outside of happy hour. Cocktail menu covering a lot of ground. Easily becoming my fave arvo spot in Sanur.","laid back no frills beach restaurant. popular with surfers. very cheap, big portions. good breakfast menu. sit inside or on the beach. toilets don’t have sprayers tho!","On the beach, quiet and peaceful — food very good and well priced. Service punctual and polite — will certainly go back for more","I had dinner here and the food was great. Spaghetti marinara with seafood, plenty of seafood on the plate. Very tasty and the pasta cooked perfectly. Nice ambience for dinner on the beach. Although I have some issue with the coffee, but it’s still okay. Tried the Sanur sunrise on cocktails menu and it was okay."

Also, very noisy inside, so not the most pleasant atmosphere.","I am so happy to have stumbled across this cute Sushi spot during my Bali visit. Their sushi is fresh and delicious with other options to choose from as well. The green tea I ended my meal with with brewed to perfection, not sugar needed. The establishment is clean and picture perfect. Great service and sushi find with optional outdoor seating!","I recently dined at Sushitou in Sanur, and it was an absolute delight. The ambiance was serene, and the staff were cheerful and attentive. Top faves ate the crispy tuna, and beef yakinikudon.","Here's the details;

- 15 mins waiting for 1 mineral water, sun squash, lychee tea
- 20 mins waiting grilled salmon
- 35 mins waiting for crispy teriyaki, crispy salmon roll, 1 set nigiri
- and... ANOTHER 37 mins just for 2 Ramen as extra order, then we decided to take it away, BECAUSE it's too hot and very humid inside. How is it possible 6x18 meter² only have 2 aircon? Very uncomfortable with 15 people inside.

There were only 4 tables with customers, how was it possible to be overwhelmed? Well, we found out that so funny when all the drinks out together with the food ahaha, I wonder if all the staff were trained before?

Overall it's not worth spending both time and money at Sushitou. I would prefer go to mall and proper sushi restaurants with better service and quality food.

In the end, we realized that we really look like a local, maybe that's one of the reason we didn't get the VVIP service like bule got lol. Oh yeah, yet, we tipped them just like bule 🙏

I don't usually make a review, this is for future customers and reminders if you wanna get full service, you gotta dress up properly."
