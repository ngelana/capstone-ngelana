So good,"The best place to watch the sunset in Bali. It is UNREAL. Even on a cloudy day, it is magical! The food was delicious, atmosphere was booming and staff were as friendly as can be. The saxophone player was super talented and made the whole vibe! What an absolute incredible experience","We are back to El Kabron for the 3rd time! The views, the atmosphere, the vibes and the food are incredible. There‚Äôs no cliff beach club that compares to anywhere in Bali. Ms. Sura was looking after us all times and she was very kind and professional. The customer service is exceptional and the food is very tasty. The team at this place will be very helpful and happy! We enjoyed our time so much, especially with sheesha, drinks and views overlooking the sea. Highly recommend for a day time or if you prefer sunset time. They have always entertainment and DJ which gives a whole new vibe to the place. Thank you all for the wonderful and amazing fun we had!","Wow, staff are fantastic, vibe is great! Note to self bring some sunscreen as it‚Äôs red hot until sunset. Sunset is epic and definitely worth experiencing.

We can only describe the hotel as pure luxury! It is such a peaceful quiet hotel and a stunning setting. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming. During our stay we booked to eat dinner at Akasa restaurant - stunning views at sunset, amazing food but expensive as to be expected. Well worth booking a table there in advance as it gets booked up quite quickly. The breakfast was also outstanding - so many options every day and the coffee was great.
We also used the gym while we were here - it was well equipped and maintained.
We would return in a heartbeat!","My experience at Jumeirah Hotel was quite disappointing, particularly due to the treatment we received from the front service staff. Upon arrival with my partner, we were stopped at the gate by security. They asked if we had restaurant reservations, to which I replied that we did not. Unfortunately, instead of being welcoming, the security guard completely ignored me and focused all attention on my foreign partner, which made me feel ‚Äúprofiled‚Äù.

The same pattern continued when we entered the lobby. I expected a warm reception at a five-star hotel, but I was once again overlooked while my partner received all the attention from the other security and reception. It was disheartening to feel like a second-class guest in such a prestigious establishment.

When I approached a staff member (the security at the lobby) to express my disappointment politely, I was met with indifference. he didn't offer an apology and instead excused his and their behavior by saying they might have been nervous, which was not an acceptable response.

On a positive note, I must commend the restaurant service and food quality, which were exceptional. The restaurant staff were attentive and provided a delightful dining experience, deserving of 5 stars üéâ","Stayed recently for a family holiday to celebrate a special occasion. The villas are tastefully furnished, luxurious and the grounds are beautiful. The kids club is very well run and Tami is an absolute delight, a natural with children. Kids over 4 can be left with the staff to play, under 4 will require you to arrange a nanny (they can organise this in-house if you don't have a private one). We had the pleasure of meeting GM Ram Hiralal on a number of occasions and she is personable and extremely hospitable. Staff are excellent, breakfast is of very good quality. The spa is a must - book in advance and many of the activities are very well run. Highly recommend if looking to be in Uluwatu!","Jumeriah is one of the most beautiful and luxury hotel. I have stayed in many beautiful hotels in Bali but this one was a winner. The hotel is so luxury and elegant and feels like your in a grand hotel in Dubai. What makes it stand out if the beautiful staff who work there and are always so attentive and anything is possible. They attend your needs without even asking and your always looked after in every way from the breakfast, pool and the buggy staff. The food in the hotel is so delicious and everything is just perfect.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a luxury treatment and amazing service and top quality hotel. Me and my husband were amazed by everything , just wow. It is situated on the quieter side of Ulawatu but only a 15 min cab ride to the main area so its good to get some down side.","Absolutely fantastic stay at the Jumeirah, Bali. The service is another level compared to other resorts - Ema, who looked after us, really did go above and beyond for us and our one year old daughter. A huge shout out to Ema and all the team, they really understand brilliant service and nothing is too much to ask. Kids club is fantastic (like a full blown nursery), food amazing, pool great and the villas are incredibly spacious - beds ridiculously comfy! Rarely write reviews but our experience was so good, that we felt compelled to write one. Highly recommend, particularly to anyone with kids. Best hotel in Uluwatu."

The staff were super friendly and welcoming. We required some medication late one night and the night manager drove us without accepting payment to the pharmacy and back. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The breakfast was delicious with a huge selection and when we checked in we were informed we also receive buffet dinner which was a great surprise. The rooftop area has an incredible view over dreamland beach and is only a short walk down to the beach. All the facilities you could need are included and the staff go above and beyond with even the simplest of requests. We will certainly be back.,"Room was dusty and run down. Strong moth repellent smell in the bathroom. Towels given were not too clean.
Service was really good as everyone was very friendly.
Direct access to beach however is not that direct. You will need to go down a bunch of steep stairs and onto the small beach.
Location of the hotel is also inconvenient and far from shops and restaurants.
Food was also mediocre and lack variety. The dinner buffet was either bland or too salty.
All-in-all, not the 5-star hotel experience I was expecting.","Really nice resort. I found the room cheaper on another site. The staff are all really friendly and never had any issues. Breakfast and dinner were included, and like others stated, it wasn't amazing, but for the price to have that included, I'm not going to complain. Perhaps consider an add-on option for an optional menu pick of nicer food at a higher price? The only negative thing i can really say is that the spa is a bit expensive. They are good, but its a lot more than the normal rate in the area.","The General Manager likes to take long lunches‚Ä¶

This was one of the most frustrating experiences. Long story short, our booking needed to be moved due to a flight cancellation. The hotel refused to change the dates (after 24 hours of no response from their end), we lost the full payment for two nights but they offered us a special rate (pretty much two nights for the price of one) for our next stay. We took them up on it but when we arrived, the room rate changed. We were charged for two nights at full price.

Not the most frustrating part in this, what was really awful was that during the 1 week process we were unable to get a hold of the General Manager. When we did eventually arrive and ran into another problem we were asked to stay in a hot lobby for 90 mins while the manager texted the front desk telling us to wait until he was finished lunch.

The staff didn‚Äôt know what to do as only the manager could solve the issue. We ended up leaving and going to another hotel rather than continue to wait for someone that obviously wasn‚Äôt bothered.

Really poor service, very disappointing.","This is far from 5-stars. It‚Äôs simple, the people are friendly but nothing beyond a regular hotel. The inlet to the beach is disgusting but others reviews don‚Äôt show that reality. And it‚Äôs tiny. Rooms are average but big, so space was nice. The balcony‚Äôs need cleaning. Food is very mediocre. We ordered nachos and they were a tiny portion and looked like fake beef. I‚Äôm fact, apart from the breakfast, most food was mediocre. More like 3 stars so set expectations accordingly. The beach close by is disgusting as well. I wouldn‚Äôt stay more than 5 mins. The Internet in the room wasn‚Äôt working either and the water gets warm. Glad we got a deal because this was an average not memorable experience. View from the golf room was nice when it was sunny. Staff did the best they could to improve things but really it‚Äôs management and cooking staff that needs improvement!"

The beach itself doesn‚Äôt have a huge amount of facilities, I would recommend going straight past the first group of beds, past the rocks and on to the main larger part of the beach. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll likely be asked to pay c. 100k IDR per person for a bed which is a little cheeky.

Other than that, a better beach than Padang Padang but still nothing special.","Really neat beach. Not many tourists come here which makes it even better. Beware of ILLEGAL parking fees here. You‚Äôll find people with handwritten boards claiming IDR 5,000 for parking and they won‚Äôt give you any receipt. YOU CAN DENY to pay. It‚Äôs illegal anyway. Note that scooters can reach near the beach but for cars, it might be difficult. The last 100 meters are a bit steep.","Dreamland Beach is truly one of the best and serene beaches in Bali. It attracts a lot of foreigners seeking a peaceful getaway. The beach is a bit secluded, requiring a walk of around 200 meters to reach it, contributing to its tranquil ambiance. It's a must-visit if you have about an hour and a half to spare, offering a serene escape from the bustling atmosphere of other beaches.","Nice beach, not many people during our stay. You can rent a sun bed, restaurant near by. Small disadvantage you have to walk (goCar parking) cca 200m downhill. Small entry fee needed.","Great beach, went twice in 1 week, you have to make a small donation to get onto the beach. Ordered food there too which was very tasty

It‚Äôs an odd place that looks like it has potential but it just seemed flung together. Great sunset and no issues parking as there is a huge parking lot.","Not so crowded beach club, happy hour with Arak cocktails, beautiful sunset view. Totally recommended if you are in Uluwatu.","Hidden gem overlooking dreamland beach. Minimum spend is 100 per person which can be used for food or drink. The place is so big that it‚Äôs a waste of space at this point but perfect for what we wanted. Music, infinity pools, lawn chairs and cabanas for a nice relaxing setting at the pool. Food was a large portion which was actually unexpected for usual pool bars. Best bang for your buck in Bali we have found so far hands down. Good service, giant establishment, has anything you need. Minimum is 100‚Äô000 RP","Amazing beach club perched on top of Dreamland beach.
Sunsets are amazing and this beach club it‚Äôs not as pricey as other ones that we have been to. Food is so so and other areas of beach clubs are like abandoned, but if you are into clean pools and magical sunset views then you need to check this place up!
Only thing it opens at midday and ordes of noisy tourists get dropped off to the beach club just before sunset, so I suggest to arrive around 2/3 to get a good sunset spot"

There are several big rocks along the coast. The beach is quite nice for a beach stroll walk and you can swim when the ocean is quite calm. Highly recommended to visit!,"Cemongkak Beach is my favorite place to see the sunset. Not many people know this beach, the entrance ticket is free, access to the beach is actually easy because it is paved, but the road is complicated, there are lots of turns. Here, no one sells food, so I have to bring my own food and drink. The location itself is actually on the left side of Dreamland Beach. Besides being able to enjoy the view of the beach, usually here there are also cows from local residents. The meadow which is quite wide is also the main attraction of this beach area.

We were greeted warmly by all staff from the start to end of the night.
When sat at our table, we were given complimentary coconut, berry & lime drinks as well as freshly steamed bao buns with herbed butter and prawn crunch.
We were then given a selection of menus and plenty of time to look them over. We had the head chef (Joan) come to our table to welcome us and help make our selections.
We decided to order-

Entree:
Chicken Kaarage- the chicken was juicy and crispy, the sauce had some spice but wasn‚Äôt over powering and accompanied the chicken perfectly
Beef Wagyu Salad- Very tasty, fragrant and light

Main:
Truffle tenderloin- so well balanced! The beef was perfectly cooked and the sweetness of the pear just made the dish amazing!
Grilled tiger prawn- the sauce was light, fluffy and aerated, the prawns were soft, cooked to perfection and full of flavour

Desert:
Chocolate sphere- this was a decedent and delicious desert, the acidity from the berries made it delicious
Surprise wedding gift: Mango cream tart- unsure if this tart is even on the menu, but it 100% should be, it was the best desert we have ever had! Everything about the tart was to die for.

Drinks:
The first king- so well balanced, we could definitely have had a few too many, the papaya and cinnamon was an amazing touch.
Maluku sour- perfect egg white and awesome flavour

Last notes:
We couldn‚Äôt be happier with our experience from the staff specifically- Mardika and Christian they were both more than accomodating and so helpful, polite and well spoken. The chefs Joan and Devo are second to none, their food is world class and are so glad they made our night so special. Thank you to the entire team at Akasa, we will definitely be back!

The moment I walked in, I was captivated by the serene and inviting atmosphere. The restaurant is nestled in a lush, tropical setting that instantly transports you to a tranquil oasis.

The open-air seating area allowed me to enjoy the gentle breeze and the soothing sound of nature while savoring a delicious meal. The restaurant's design seamlessly blends modern elegance with traditional Balinese charm, creating a warm and inviting ambiance.

The staff, especially Dipa, were incredibly attentive and hospitable, ensuring that every aspect of my dining experience was perfect. The menu offered a delightful selection of both local and international dishes, all prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients.

I was particularly impressed by the attention to detail in the presentation of each dish, which only added to the overall experience. Whether you're looking for a romantic dinner or a relaxing lunch surrounded by nature, Akasa Restaurant in Jumeirah is the perfect choice.

For those seeking a budget-friendly hotel, it's important to remember that compromises are common, as with any destination. As a city dweller myself, I've learned to appreciate the beauty in the imperfections. Embrace the stunning nature, breathtaking sunsets, delicious local cuisine, the warm hospitality of the Balinese, and the serene tranquility of the island. Bali is a hub of investment, so construction is a norm here, but it contributes to the growth of local businesses therefore I don‚Äôt mind some inconvenience it may cause. Minor inconveniences shouldn't overshadow the experience. Dreamland View is ideally located near some of the most picturesque beaches and fantastic restaurants.

Wishing everyone a fantastic vacation, and I hope to see you here, as I'm a loyal guest myself.","DO NOT BOOK!!! Photos are a lie. The property is under major construction. Builders working throughout the day on the room balcony, no privacy and loud noise! The pool was out of order due to the construction, and there is no view now a building it being built directly in front of the property.

A shame as the staff were very pleasant, but the ‚Äòmarketing‚Äô support on the other end of the phone when asking for a refund was very unhelpful. We had to move hotels and only received a 50% refund‚Ä¶still fighting this as we are now out of pocket.","AVOID! DO NOT BOOK! I booked 3 nights here having travelled all over Bali for a few weeks, expecting a few days of relaxation in a nice hotel. I arrived to find the accommodation in an appalling state. Nothing at all like the pictures advertised. The room was grimey, and lacked basics such as bedside lamps, phone, hand towels, fridge. The shower drain was a hole in the floor, there were gouges and holes in the walls, the bedroom door didn‚Äôt lock properly and the staff didn‚Äôt know the wifi password (eventually connected). Major building works within the building with exposed concrete, rubbish, ladders. Within an hour I went downstairs to explain my concerns and was passed the housekeepers mobile phone to speak to the ‚Äòmanager‚Äô. There was a screaming baby in the background, she was extremely rude, told me this room (a sea view room) ‚Äòdoes not come with lamps‚Äô because there was a ‚Äòsea view‚Äô. This obviously made no sense. She refused to allow me to move rooms, refused refund as ‚ÄòI had changed my mind and it‚Äôs not her problem‚Äô and moaned about the commission and tax she has to pay. She refused to give me details of her superior, and hung up on me leaving me in tears, alone at night, having to find alternative accommodation and taxi to somewhere else. I‚Äôve travelled a lot, I have never experienced such a disgusting case of false advertising or customer service from a hotel / accommodation. I am awaiting Expedia to look into a refund request.","The location is king due to the fact that it‚Äôs nearby at the dreamland beach. That beach is the most amazing beach in Bali. The highlight is as well the few on the rooftop. A shared kitchen and a place to hang out as well on the roof. It‚Äôs mostly a clean title kitchen however it‚Äôs shared so sometimes you might have a different experience. The rooms are small, tidy and clean, but the bathrooms are wooden made, which is not the best idea due to cleaning. However, it‚Äôs a nice hotel, where you get what you pay for. It‚Äôs definitely worth it but it‚Äôs also all right to go ahead with your trip. The pool is small but it will do for what it‚Äôs there.

The place is very cute with seating next to the pool or in covered space. You can find different kind of breakfasts, from fruit plates to pancakes, burgers and croissant. We tried all the above and it was very tasty for a very considerate price. The staff is very friendly and you can pay by card.","The place is amazing but has some improvements to do on the menu / understanding of the staff. My partner ordered a beef burger and got a vegetarian instead, cold and tasteless. I got the watermelon salad and the portion is so small we can‚Äôt call it salad, more of an appetizer. If they can make small changes it will be a very good place in Bingin. The pool is beautiful and I will come back to try the pizza :)",Came for happy hour (60k for signature cocktails).

Tony was an amazing host and invited us to use the pool while we waited for our food. Stunning location, delicious food and lots of vegetarian options! Will definitely be coming back to rogue house!","I had the pleasure of visiting Rogue House recently and I must say, their coffee is absolutely amazing. The blend of Arabica and Robusta creates a delightful flavor with a low acidity level. Additionally, the place itself has a very nice design.

If I may offer a suggestion, in my humble opinion, it would be wonderful if the usage of the pool could be included in the current pricing. The pool is not just a typical swimming pool, but rather a refreshing water feature that perfectly complements the overall ambiance. Charging separately for its usage feels a bit like charging for the a view.

All in all, I highly recommend a visit to  Rogue House for their exceptional coffee, remarkable atmosphere, and a pleasant design."

Seafood plate is a real deal, good value. All dishes were presented very well.

I ordered the Vietnamese summer rolls (delicious and fresh, although I would‚Äôve liked if the dipping sauce was a bit lighter so I could dip without the filling falling out), the vegan sweet potato gnocchi (yummy and moist), and a side salad (very standard but did the trick). The kaffir lime cocktails I got were outstanding! By the end I was stuffed. I enjoyed looking out at the view, a few of the guests wading in the water at times. Very relaxing. Very friendly. I‚Äôll be back!","We stayed at The Elementum for over a week and the highlight was to work through the entire Mensa menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner with the magnificent views of the ocean. The all day breakfast option was great for lighter meals later in the day. The vegan and vegetarian options available are amazing and most dishes can be modified to make them either. The juices and desserts are not to be missed. Don't be shy to ask the staff about their culture and food as they are very friendly and knowledgeable. The kind of genuine hospitality that becomes the most memorable and meaningful part of exploring a new culture.","I highly recommend this place. The food is high quality, very tasty, and colorful, all at an excellent price. The service is also incredible, always with a smile and excellent communication. We ordered the seafood platter, pork belly, and on another day, we had the steak. Everything was amazing.

I think there are better options around and cheaper","I recently had the pleasure of staying at this charming family-owned guesthouse, and it exceeded my expectations in every way. The short distance to the beach made it incredibly convenient to enjoy the sun and surf. What truly stood out was the expansive garden and inviting pool, providing a serene backdrop for relaxation. Whether I wanted to take a dip in the pool or simply lounge amidst the greenery, this guesthouse offered the perfect retreat.

Beyond the lovely amenities, it was the friendly staff that truly made my stay memorable. Their warm and accommodating nature made me feel right at home.

The staff's warm and welcoming demeanor made me feel like a cherished guest. Their local insights enhanced my stay, and their attentiveness was impeccable.

What sets this guesthouse apart is the remarkable balance between quality and affordability. I found it to be a fantastic value for the experience offered. If you seek a tranquil beachside getaway with a personal touch, I highly recommend this charming guesthouse.","Such a beautiful hotel close by the beach. I had the pleasure to stay 5 days in this hotel and I enjoyed every day so much. The room was super comfortable, clean and big. I could relax inside the room, at the lodge or in the beautiful garden with the swimming pool. Daily room service was amazing.

The location is not the most centric one but that makes it more peaceful. There‚Äôs one caf√© walking-distance and besides that you‚Äôll need a motorcycle to move around or you can simply order a taxi. You can rent a scooter directly in the hotel.

The internet wasn‚Äôt extremely good in the room but in the garden it worked perfectly.
It is a great staying to relax and been in a quite space while working or vacationing.

No breakfast or kitchen service, but with the nearby caf√© that‚Äôs not an issue at all.

There‚Äôs indeed a barking dog (as you might read in another review) but you‚Äôll just need to win her heart by petting her and she‚Äôll stop barking at you :)

Came here after every surf. Normally, the service is great with the waitresses and the juice bar guys. The cashiers are a different story. The big lady with hot pink lipstick was taking forever with the guy before me because he wanted a copy of his receipt and she just looked at him blankly. He had to call a local guy in line to translate although she spoke good English. My turn came in, I ordered and when I opened my wallet, the 100000 notes I remember putting there were gone so I asked, ‚Äúcan we cancel the drinks? I don‚Äôt have enough cash‚Äù.

She said, you see the menu, you should pay. I said, well, I can‚Äôt. The money is gone. Just cancel everything then. She said, okay. don‚Äôt come back here later

First rude person I met in Bali. Most reviews already say the service is bad. There is a restaurant at Klapa with good local food also.  Just go to the parking area and you‚Äôll notice the sign on the stairs. Great view, much better service, and it‚Äôs a cafeteria set up.

I feel like this resort ruined my feelings towards resorts in general as well. The rooms looker alright, but the room service is waaaaay too overpriced and the quality was lacking severely. The housekeeping came and went at various times throughout the entire day.. one time even coming in late in the evening. Very weird.

The hotel itself is pretty far away from the city, so you really need a car or scooter. Luckily the hotel can help you with this.
The reasons for my 2 stars is the nice service for the bike and the breakfast buffet, which was alright.

The people were very friendly though!","This place was lovely however it's very isolated. You were restricted to either staying within the hotel, paying for a driver (which is fine if its for the day but not for longer stays) or renting a scooter. Rooms were very clean and spacious - we were upgraded for free which was an awesome bonus!

BE CAREFUL! Always check your room bill. We paid for our room prior to arriving however when we arrived, we were told that we hadn't paid. If this occurrence was a once off then we'd chalk it up to a mistake however there were numerous occasions where we were told to pay for something that we'd already paid for or was mysteriously added to our bill. We weren't the only ones this happened to, we had two other people with us and also overheard a fairly heated exchange with another group of travelers. The hotel restaurant prices are very much the same as somewhere like Perth/Melbourne so be prepared for a fairly expensive holiday.","Beautiful place to stay, friendly staff who are always ready to help.
Unfortunately it's very secluded so you will need a taxi to get around pretty much anywhere you want to go, hence the 4*
Presidential Suite was very nice and the kids loved having a private swimming pool all to themselves. Rooms were serviced every day (cleaned, clean towels, water, coffee, etc)
Food prices at the resort are comparable to Australian prices but eating out at other restaurants is much cheaper and the food is good
Easter Day Sunday, a buffet was organized by the resort. The food was very good with lots to choose from including deserts.
The kids had fun colouring eggs then going egg hunting","Not terrible room was nice (not a true resort if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for) . The room didn‚Äôt have good noise reduction as in the door didn‚Äôt seal very well and you could hear everything in the hallway including them rolling luggage carts around at about 4-5 am before the sun came up. There were tiny piss ants EVERYWHERE including my bags after I left them in the room all day. Also the room in general wasn‚Äôt the cleanest. the floor in the bathroom especially was really dirty. The whole room smelled like dirty feet/mold after whatever air freshener they spray in the rooms when you check in wore off. We told the staff this and asked to be moved to a different room, instead they sent a staff member up to check our claims(which checked out).They then sprayed bug spray all over and wiped the table with bug spray, then cleaned the floor in the bathroom really quick so now our room smells like bug spray chemicals (yummy).Overall it‚Äôs ok. About as clean as the 13 dollar place we stayed at the night before except this place does have a nice pool. Also restaurant on site. Location is good for the beach but you must travel a bit in taxi to get to areas with shopping/restaurants. The staff are nice and friendly so don‚Äôt let me ant issue dissuade that and the bedding was clean
EDIT: water also had a brown tint and smelled metallic. I didn‚Äôt mention it at first because I figured it may be normal for this area.

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Segaran restaurant at Jumeirah Hotel, and the experience was nothing short of exceptional. One of the standout features of my visit was their tiramisu dessert - an absolute must-try. With its subtle sweetness, it provides an indulgent but balanced finish to your meal.

Moreover, the setting of the restaurant deserves commendation. Perfectly situated for some much-needed respite on a hot day, it offers a spectacular view that complements the outstanding food. Its idyllic location also makes it the ideal spot to appreciate the breathtaking sunset during the evening.

I highly recommend the afternoon coffee here. There's something incredibly soothing about sipping a well-brewed cup as you gaze at the stunning vistas.

The ambiance, coupled with the excellent culinary offerings, makes Segaran a place you would want to revisit. I, for one, am looking forward to my next visit. If you haven't been here yet, make sure you add it to your list. You won't regret it!","We were deciding on a place to eat last minute. We were rushing to decide where as we were both hungry and we also wanted to go somewhere we could see the sunset. We looked on google maps and chose Segaran as it was nearby and on the coast. We hadn't really looked much beyond some photos on google maps. We were pleasantly very surprised to discover it was in a fancy resort. We rocked up on our scooter and security signed us in and must have radioed through to the staff in the lobby to advise we were coming as they welcomed us by name when we drove up. The staff in the lobby advised they have valet parking and took our bike keys and helmet. I was a little embarrassed and so glad we just happened to wear something nice that evening. We were then driven through the stunning resort to the restaurant.  The resort has incredibly beautiful gardens and what look to be high end villas.
We were seated outside at the edge of the garden with stunning sunset views.
We were given welcome Jamu drinks and delicious bread which were like a cross between Naan bread and Poppadums and dips that were like tastes of different curries.

We started with Calamari, main of whole fish and Leg of Duck with vegetables and finished with a chocolate and a lime dessert with Tea.

The meal, service and scenery was fantastic! Highly recommend! 1 appetisers, 2 mains, 2 desserts, Tea and a cocktail all for Rp1,657,700","A warm cosy atmosphere with great tasting food. The staff are so friendly and cant do enough to make sure you have a wonderful time.
Really loved dinning in the restaurant as the views are also spectacular. The whole team working here is fantastic and should be very proud of how they run the restaurant.","One of the best brunch that I‚Äôve made in Bali.   I can even say, one of my favourite foodie destination in Bali. The selection of dishes is great and perfectly executed. The food is tasty and I really like the twist between Asian food and western food. I am never bored to eat there.
We went for my mother birthday and the Excutive chef Vincent Leroux had organised a last minutes birthday cake. We informed them when we arrived at the brunch.","The food was amazing but the really elements that made our diner there so memorable was the staff and the location.
The staff were super kind and did there job to the perfection.
The view of the sunset was magnificent.
