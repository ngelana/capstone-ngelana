It's quite sad but the room definitely needs some renovations. The bathroom was really old and not really functional. Please be careful because when I arrived the lady was asking me for another price like I booked.,"A bit rundown but clean. The location is just perfect, with a beautiful view over Java. The staff is friendly and accomodating","It's not the worst place I stayed. The good side is that the staff is nice and trys to do as much as they are able to.
Besides that is absolutely run down, it's clean and the garden looks nice.
You get a flair of an hounted place in the evening. But it's kind a nice experience to stay here one or two night.
However it is overpriced. I have stayed in much better places, for less than the half.","Interesting place really. Didn't changed at all since i have been here ten years ago. For people who like spacious, empty and hidden places, little creepy but with the flair of some long ago days glory, this is worth a stay. Choose the best room and than enjoy to have the whole hotel with hundreds of meters ocean front for your own. Of course it is overprized and you don't expect luxury, you come to enjoy the special flair and peace and the ""out of time and place feeling"" here.
Absolutely fine for one or two night stop while a roundtrip on bali. This is so much ""the other part"" of Bali.","The worst place I have ever stayed at in my life. No water for shower, run down hotel with no English speaking staff. Close to the beach but very noisy from early on. Definately not worth the money. Staying in a hammock would be nicer!"
