More then plenty of space with a view that was even better in person!

The service that was provided was unbeatable! They have cleaning in the morning and turndown service in the evening. They also have a restaurant on site you can enjoy or you can order food and have it brought to your villa. A delicious complementary breakfast was included every morning (highly recommend the banana pancakes!).

The entire staff was very polite and helpful. 100% worth the value. Highly recommend this villa!","Wow Wow, this place is a hidden treasure. We booked the 2 Bedroom Pool Villa. Amazing and spacious rooms including 3 Bathrooms. The view is spectacular from our villa and pool. We stayed for 2 nights, and there was no need to leave this place. The sunsets and sunrises were beautiful. We ate at the restaurant for our meals. This area is brand new, and super clean. Although it was a little slow for the food to come out, but that was no concern as werenâ€™t going anywhere and it was of good quality. We just made sure we came down for a couple of drinks and order our food and enjoyed the view.
I would recommend staying somewhere for a night or 2 in between coming from airport, as it is a fair drive. We stayed in Ubud to break it up. If youâ€™re after a chilled out time and relaxing, this is the place. Will definitely come back here for sure.","I love everything about this place. It was very clean, staff was doing everything to make it look like a dreamland. I had very good and easy contact with one of the managers, even if they couldn't find me around the hotel he ask me on whatsapp about room cleaning. Will definitely be back there to one of the Villas!","I booked a villa with some friends and the stay overpassed my expectations.

The staff is absolutely outstanding, they are really polite and always ready to help you in case you need it.

The villa is amazing with fantastic views and sunset and everything you need for your stay.

Food is available upon request and amazing quality-price.

If you want to relax with some friends, having a fantastic time either alone or with someone, this is the place to be.

It was the highlight of my holidays in Bali.

I have definitely no doubts I will be back if I am passing by the north of the island.","I spent 2 nights with a group of friends in March in the villa with Seaview.
What can I say? This place is simply a dream.
I truly felt spoiled during my whole staying.
I could be talking about the beauty of the view for long but I'll just leave some photos which will speak for me.
We also had dinner both nights at the villa.
The staff literally takes care of everything and the food is really good! I highly suggest to ask the BBQ night, it was just delicious!
We even got to play Jenga and UNO if you want to fight with your friends while relaxing ðŸ˜‚
Bedrooms are spacious and the beds are really comfortable, the bathroom is the typical tropical style, very pretty.
Highly suggested if you want to take a little break from the crowded areas of Bali, enjoy the beauty of nature and just purely relax. Wifi works perfectly everywhere in the villa so easy to work from there too!

Highlights for me were the view and the staff

I'm going back 100%
Thank you so much for everything"
