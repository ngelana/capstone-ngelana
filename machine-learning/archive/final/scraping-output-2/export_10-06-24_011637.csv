Wira homestay stole my heart ","Great budget hotel, staff are a highlight, rooms are super clean and the food is so good and reasonably priced. You can also hire scooters from them. You will need scooter as it's a bit of a walk to anywhere and the roads are dodgy to walk as in narrow and winding","2nd time staying here, love the location, service, massages on site. It's a great place for the price. The pool could have been cooler...the whole time we were there I only swam once as the water was so hot it was hotter than outside. Apart from that I'd go back","WIRA Homestay left a very pleasant impression.

Otherwise we liked the accommodation and it was walkable to the shops and nice cafes and restaurants nearby. The beach was also a short taxi ride away.","Perfect place to stay in Uluwatu if you want to stay close to the beach, nice restaurants, yoga and Pilates places and still feel the local vibe.

The pool is amazing and the rooms are clean and wild (as we want it to be in Bali) üòä
Get ready to hear the hens on the neighbors backyard and probably you‚Äôll find these cute cats around the pool asking for cuddles!","very nice and cozy hotel with separate small villas. Comfortable area, well-groomed and clean nice pool. The concept of the hotel is relaxation and privacy in a soft, comfortable environment. The rooms are nice, but for the price they obviously require improvements and a little more comfort. The air conditioner does not work, the owners refuse to charge it and, as a result, it blows slightly cool air. The rooms are cleaned rather mediocrely but every day. They often forget to put in tea, coffee, toilet paper and other necessary things! If I rate the hotel from 1 to 5, I‚Äôll give it a solid 4, mostly due to the location, clean pleasant area and smiling staff","I would highlight the location of this hotel, close to lots of nice restaurants and shops. However, it is very noisy that we couldn't sleep at all (the cabinets' walls are so thin that you can even hear your neighbors talking). The breakfast also disappointed me. In general, I expected more, taking into account the pictures shown in the media.",Good location. Breakfast was 2/5 stars (chips with a set breakfast is not ok..). The lodge is right next to a farm yard so you cannot sleep in past 7am otherwise the chickens will wake you up! Nice pool though :)

Up in the hills you find a quiet place - close to everything- just 10min to the beach. It has stunning view with an amazing sunset. You can feel the vision and the founders love that created the Hotel in every room that has its own expressions. The staff is very kind and service minded. The pool and lounge area are very nice and feels small and private. The restaurant has the best wines on the island and the food is great. It‚Äôs not worth leaving the hotel to have food at any other restaurant. Stay and enjoy the sunset, a glass  of wine and the great food. We are definitely coming back to Hidden Hills Villas next year!","Just got back from our third stay at Hidden Hills Villas in Bali, and wow, it still blows me away. That ocean view you wake up to? Unreal. It's Bali's best-kept secret. Our villa was ultra luxurious yet still great for the kids- they've really nailed the whole luxury-living vibe.

The butler service is something else. They just get it. Always there when you need them, but never in the way. And they really know their stuff about Bali, pointing us to some gems we wouldn‚Äôt have found on our own.

Oh, and the food? The grilled lobster is a must-try, dining under the stars here is unbeatable.

The whole experience from start to finish is just perfect . It‚Äôs the personalized touches that make it for us.

I would give 6 stars if I could","We stayed here for New Year's eve last year and it was the perfect getaway to experience Bali's magical day of silence. Cozy, comfy, stylish, amazing food and service, sophisticated and it was simply a dream to stay at this boutique hotel. We decided to come back a few weeks ago and it was even better. The restaurant has really become a big highlight. Their new spa therapists hands are magical and the team overall just seems to have grown. Everyone of their staff has a wine diploma which is so impressive for Bali standards. But the best part for us is the comfort of the villas (they actually look like in the pictures) as well as the beds, like sleeping on clouds. Heavenly. We will be back soon in what we know to be the best boutique hotel in Bali.","We stayed at the Hidden Hills Villas for 2 nights in early May and thoroughly enjoyed our short stay. We had the Santorini Villa which is a 1 bedroom and 1 bath villa with a private pool. The villa was beautiful and very spacious. There are separate AC units for the bedroom and living room area and both units worked very well. The living room area had a fairly large fridge which contained mini bar items (not free) but there is enough room in it to keep a few of your items as well. This villa has a large outdoor bathroom with a separate shower and bathtub. Since it is outdoors, you are subjected to the weather i.e. it can be quite warm when you are using the bathroom. The staff at Hidden Hills was incredibly helpful and friendly. They use a WhatsApp while you are staying and you can text them with questions, requests, etc. Our head butler, Tusan was very friendly, responsive, and accomodating. He helped us with laundry, room service, local food delivery, and scheduling massages. We also scheduled picked up from Ubud and airport transportation through the resort and Putu was always on time and very friendly. The resort has a small gym with an elliptical, free weights, and cable machine. The gym is open 24 hours but the AC unit in it is quite small and isn't kept running so the gym can be quite warm. During our stay (May 2024) the neighboring property and Hidden Hills were both doing construction. The construction can be disruptive depending on when you wake up. I think construction would start around 7-8 am and we could hear it because it was right next to our villa. Hidden Hills is currently converting a villa into a dedicated spa so if you want a massage, they use one of the empty villas. We did a 90 min Balinese massage and it was wonderful and affordable. Overall, if you are visiting Uluwatu, I would highly recommend staying at the Hidden Hills Villas. The villas are beautiful, the staff is very friendly and helpful, and getting around with Grab from this location was pretty easy. If I visit the area again, I would definitely stay at Hidden Hills.","We stayed a while back at this hotel, which we found through Small Luxury Hotels of the World, and wow, did it live up to the hype! We splurged on their biggest villa - 5 bedrooms just for us four. Sounds excessive, but the deal was too good to pass up.

The place was a dream. Huge infinity pool, an awesome lounge area where we hung out most of the time, a home cinema, and a gym. And the view? Absolutely the best I've seen on Bali, especially the sunsets. Every room was so detailed, from the massive walk-in closets to the fancy bathrooms (mine again had a killer view!). The kitchen was ginormous.

The staff were all stars, especially Imene, the guest relations girl, who made sure we were always happy. And the food? Incredible. Honestly, this place made us feel like celebrities without being stuffy. So worth it!"

The staff is so friendly and helpful. Beds were comfy. I loved that the bathrooms weren't open so there weren't bugs/animals in the bathroom. It is also a little outside downtown ulu so it was very quiet which was nice.,"Jepun Sari was such a lucky, rare find that I wished we were staying longer when we got there! It's a pretty hotel with great attention to detail in the rooms/bathrooms, a warm energy about it, and smart and helpful staff. I also appreciated the focus on sustainability and their super comfy beds. One thing to note is that they don't serve food, but that's not a challenge since the location is perfect (5-10 mins by scooter to the best coffee shops and restaurants - definitely check out Chela, 15mins to Savaya and Sundays). Overall great value. Recommending it to all my friends. Thanks for a lovely stay!","Beautiful.  Clean with very little bugs. Bathroom is enclosed and clean. Pool is beautiful with a sit down bar in the pool.  Coffee, latte, beer etc are for sale.   Not much walking distance so gojecks car Gojek is a necessity.   But worth it cause it‚Äôs so quiet and relaxing.  It‚Äôs so easy with a scooter or gojek. The only thing I would suggest for an improvement is a tea kettle in the kitchen for people to be able to make their own tea?   But.   What a small request after such an amazing atmosphere.  I would stay again definitely.  Not the place for parties unless you party elsewhere and come back to sleep   Great!!"

The pool is small but clean and a really nice place to refresh and sit in the sun or shade.

Like most places in uluwatu you need transportation to get around (gojek or grab), but you can also rent a motorbike from the hotel. Most beaches to the west or south are no more than 10 min by motorbike. Plenty of restaurants can be found within 10 mins.

The service is great, the staff is very friendly and helpful.

The Tom Yum Soup was spicy and tangy, really hit the spot. And the Mongolian Beef that I had with chicken (I know I know) so tender and tasty.

The cocktails, though! Bartender really knew his stuff. It was the perfect spot for a laid-back evening with great food and drinks.

The second room seemed a tiny bit better at first, however there was still mold in the room.

Very much appreciated! Can't recommend this homestay more!","Room is basic, but comfortable, clean and has everything you need. The location is close to everything, but since the rooms are away from the street it's nice and quiet at night. The staff is helpful and friendly and easy to communicate with through WhatsApp, although there isn't necessarily someone available 24/7 at the property. No breakfast at the hotel, but ""Road Trip Eatery"" is right across the street and has amazing breakfast. Similarly no laundry service, but you can bring it next door to ""Naturela Cafe"". Cleaning your room is only done on a request basis. Overall I would highly recommend this property in this area.

Points to note:
The WiFi would often come and go and was overall not very fast. It's fine for basic browsing, but if you need a stable fast connection it would be lacking.

They accepted CASH ONLY for the room payment. I only found out the day I left and didn't have enough cash.

The rooms were super clean, comfortable and cool (with AC). The staff were all very helpful and friendly. The pool and social areas are nice and well kept and the food was delicious (especially the banana pancakes for breakfast).
The surf spots varied each day, and as a beginner were suitable to my level. The surf instructors were keen to teach, their English was good and they were easy to get on with. The equipment was of good quality. The lesson did seem a little expensive for Bali prices (40 euros each) but I did feel as if I improved my surfing even in the short amount of time I was there.
The location is excellent - a short walk or scooter to restaurants/ bars and quick drive to the beach.
Special shout out to the Yoga instructor called Noa - her classes were incredible and she really put time and effort into personalizing them for each group.","I‚Äôve stayed here for ten days in march as a solo traveller and had a great time! The service was amazing. I booked the private surf shack, which had its own outdoor bathroom, an AC and a little safe for personal belongings.

Surf lessons were a lot of fun also. Just make sure to reapply a lot of sunscreen every break.

I came to Bali having never surfed before, and I left with my own board and being able to surf Uluwatu. Everyone at the camp from the interns, staff and instructors provided a really positive experience to the point where I now call them friends. The rooms were always clean and are very well maintained. Furthermore, the location of Padang is perfect! It is near all of the popular cafes and beaches but still tucked away to provide a quite evening for good sleep. I can not recommend a better place to meet amazing people and learn how to surf!","Padang camp was amazing for location/surf/staff. Everyone is super friendly and goes above for your needs. Food is great and the kitchen staff are so lovely. Surf coaches do a great job explaining surf and making you feel comfortable in the water. For more hands on experience/teaching the lessons are definitely worth the extra money. Camp is beautiful and a fun place to hangout. Thanks to Thiago, lil, Fabio, Leo and all the interns for the best stay","Nice camp for a holiday to meet nice people.

Unfortunately from a surfing point of view things could be much better.

Theory is almoust never taught, apart from surfing sessions (around 3 hours per day)
There is not much other activity where you can improve your surfing skills apart the daily session in the ocean.

Surfing board is normally paid apart at price a bit more expensive than the avg in Bali, but sometimes you cannot find the board of your size.

They accept just cash for all the payment, which is a bit ridiculous considering they charge prices way higher than local prices.
They offered a 10% discount in exchange for a 5 star review.

Overall a nice camp with nice people, but could be much better managed in my opinion."

The staff were very sweet And met each of our needs.
If you are coming to uluwatu, i would recommend it because it‚Äôs definitely worth the price as well.","Very pleasant, large airy rooms. Great for the price","The pictures looked lovely - our room was not. The mattresses was mouldy so was the pillows. There was also old blood, a worm in the shower and pretty dirty.
Maybe do a deep clean every now and again and change the pillow and mattresses.
It was fine for two days but won‚Äôt come back and won‚Äôt recommend. üòû","Had a great 8 day stay in the thatched double room on the bottom floor. I looked around at some of the other homestays in Uluwatu and this one was the best in the area. Tucked away on a side street away with lots of plants and greenery; away from the main street noise but walking distance to some excellent restaurants and shops. The staff is really friendly. I had my own little porch with a washing line and rack, chairs and table, with some small plants in front so it felt private. The room was basic but came with a lamp, fan, mosquito net, plenty of outlets and space to store my things. There is a small but nice pool refreshing on a hot day. The only drawback is that the bathroom is shared with the upper floor and the water would cut out sometimes so I'd have to wait to take a shower. Also when I was there there was construction happening next door literally 10 meters away from my room so it was noisy starting at about 7am. It didn't bother me too much as I'm an early riser. The rooms on the other side didn't look as inviting but I recommend the bamboo rooms. Excellent value for money.","The price was good, the small pool was nice. We had the impression, that the owners are part of the taxi mafia, because we couldn't find a grab. During the stay they asked us several times for a expensive transport. We did not want one and told them. They knew when our flight was and when we checked out, a taxi appeared in front of the house and all the grabs were afraid to stop."

It was so amazing that we went back 4 more times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! All of the food is amazing; there are endless gluten free and vegan options and everything is healthy while still being SO delicious. The guava cheesecake is a must try!! Also special shoutout to Hanan and Karik for being so welcoming, friendly, and helpful with menu suggestions. We will definitely be back!!","The best food in Uluwatu is at Road Trip Eatery. We came to Uluwatu for a couple weeks and tried many restaurants. Most weren‚Äôt great and not many healthy. Once I found Road Trip I was hooked. We went back many times and I‚Äôve eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner there.

There is a full breakfast menu, as well as a coffee bar, lunch menu and dinner menu. Perfect place for a family or if you‚Äôre going to meet up with a bunch of your friends. They have music weekly and I was able to see two performers while I was in Uluwatu.

My daughter loved the Mac & Cheese, Breakfast Burrito, Lasagna, Dragon fruit bowl and some of my favorites are the Golden Milk Latte, Vegan Lasagna, French Toast aer Potato Samosa dish. Everything we tried was amazing and writing this review is making me crave their food!!

Looking forward to traveling back to Bali and enjoying more food when I return.","The best smoothie bowl we had traveling 2 months around.. in this place you can really enjoy and feel the fruit and vegetable potential and incredible flavor.
You can feel there‚Äôs a lot of research behind, everything was amazing.
Thank you so much for this fantastic experience üôèüèª","I just had one of the best vegan savory breakfasts in Bali.

We had the grilled calamari and the grilled fish and as drinks the coconuts. The food was amazingly delicious and the staff was very friendly and smily. The prices are acceptable and not that expensive in comparison to other Uluwatu Restaurants. I would recommend this restaurant. One suggestion from my side: they may improve a little bit the quantity of the dishes ( more rice and mire vegetables would be great),"Seriously delicious, as another reviewer wrote! There are four options on the menu: ribs, chicken, fish, squid with rice or french fries. We had the chicken and ribs and it was one of the best meals we had on our holidays. Yogi is supernice. The portions are rather small, but that‚Äôs the perfect excuse to keep on ordering! Recommended","This is a peaceful restaurant located in a secluded and quiet place.  This restaurant specializes in grill dishes.  Chicken, Grilled Squid, Grilled Fish, and BBQ Pork Ribs are all delicious and reasonably priced.  All the staff are friendly, the food is delicious, and the three dogs in the restaurant, Shio, Rocket, and Buntung, are nice and pretty.  I visited the Warung D‚ÄôBuchu twice during my two days stay.  I will definitely come back next time !  Thank you for everything.","I order pork ribs, the meat is so tender and easy to cut. I personally love the matah sambal, it's very different with the other matah that I taste before, it's so fresh and not so spicy (pretty good for me that not really like spicy food). The price is very reasonable, worth the money, and they have dogs around (Shio and Rocket is my favourite).

The only downside is just the serving time, it's not that long but it takes longer time than other pork ribs place, so we're waiting while playing with the dogs hehe. But the service is excellent.","robby and his family are cooking some of the most delicious food i‚Äôve eaten ever. cannot recommend enough. currently in their compound (until they open the new resto at the end of the month), the place is not super easy to find but it‚Äôs just behind where the pin shows on google maps. looking forward to another visit!"

Amazing staff who were super helpful, great rooms that were cleaned every day. So worth the price! It was under construction during my stay, so soon they‚Äôll have a pool. I truly recommend this great homestay.","The Location of this Homestay is really central. Unfortunately the rest of my experience here was not as perfect: the rooms are big and spacious but mine had a lot of black mold spots on the ceiling and the walls. Plus there was construction work going on all day which did not really produce a welcoming atmosphere. There is no real garden, it‚Äôs rather a little lawn with plants through which you walk to your room and that‚Äôs it. Overall, with no garden area to hang out and no pool plus rooms that have long seen the better half of their existence this place is way overpriced. There is definitely better value in this price range in the area.","Very nice, clean and quiet. The staff is very nice also. The location is equally great. I recommend !","We had an amazing time at olas homestay!!! I stayed with my girlfriend and 4 other friends and we all enjoy it so much! Putu and the rest of the staff re awsome, always caring about us having the best time. The rooms re huge and very very comfortable, and as soon as you go for your brekky they re already making the room. Te location can't be better, if you Wanna surf at the points of the bukit pen√≠nsula is just the perfect spot. Thank you so much for everything, we re defently gonna come back!","Pros:
- The room was big and cozy. Clean and comfortable.
- The bathroom was large and had walls separating the shower from the sink and the toilet. The shower was especially nice with good water pressure.
- There was a safe, a lockable closet, and the bathroom area could be locked up as well.
- Plenty of lighting options inside the room.
- Nice seating areas outside every room.

Cons:
- The AC dripped water. The staff did supply a mop bucket and towel to contain it. They also called a repairman, but he didn‚Äôt come before we checked out. Other than the drip, the AC worked great, so it was only a small nuisance.
- Slightly pricey considering it doesn‚Äôt include breakfast, have a pool, or a fridge. Also only accepts cash."

We rented out the 2 villas at Optima Villas for a girlfriend‚Äôs get-together, and it was the perfect setup. The landscaped outdoor space and the large pools were impressive, and we loved the airy, beautifully decorated rooms.  Villas are very well maintained inside out and communications with the manager were easy. Thoughtful details like espresso machines with pods and luxurious toiletries made our stay even more enjoyable!

The location is both quiet and picturesque, yet just a 5-10 minute walk from trendy restaurants, cafes, and activity spots. The manager also connected us with a fantastic driver for our excursions further afield and trips to the airport. This was our first visit to Bingin, and hopefully not our last!","The villa has literally the best beds and pillows out of all my travels. So comfortable, quiet, and easy to get around via Gojek. The layout is suitable for a family or two couples. The pool was divine. A great place to just chill.","The pool was so great - water was the perfect temperature, large and deep enough to swim but also sitting areas with jets to just laze in the water and enjoy. Host can set you up with a driver to take you anywhere you want for the whole day or just use Gojek for a quick zip to the main Uluwatu drag where all the hip eating/shopping places are, or the beach or the spa or the temple or the padel court. Fabulous stay, thank you!","Peaceful location yet so close to Bingin. What a luxury to find a villa with a large 10m pool and deep to boot! A swimmable pool for a 2 bedroom is rare, most are mere dipping pools. Lovely garden setting to gather with friends with the sound of cicadas as a background at night. Perfect for a family or two couples. What a gem of a pair of villas. I didn't realize they could be combined to be 4 rooms. I will definitely book again with friends. No scooter noise, no roosters, same great restaurants. #binginfave","Wonderful stay at Optima Villa. Superb location, well equipped 2x large bedrooms and a beautiful pool set in a decked courtyard. Perfect for chilling with friends or for a pool party.  Fully recommend and I will certainly look to return."

The family are locals and good spirited hindu's who embrace their culture and honor it's practices with daily rituals and offerings around the property. Good breakfast by the pool side and a little chicken joint restaurant at the entrance to the property that opens at 6PM-10PM most nights... The rooms were clean and the air-con was decent. Huge shower/bathroom areas, fantastic family staff who are happy to help you with motor bike rentals, surf boards, etc.","A very relaxed and convenient place to stay in the Bukit area.

Disliked: The neighbors are doing construction next door with heavy machinery and it‚Äôs very loud, we arrived on a Saturday and it was a couple hours from finishing for the day so we went out, and luckily they didn‚Äôt work on Sunday so it wasn‚Äôt a problem, but all during the week they said they work from 8-5, not sure when the work will end.

The service is so good, so friendly and great at explaining specials. I started with the mango chili margarita which was sweet, spicy, and strong. Next, I got the chips and salsa as an appetizer which had 3 types of salsa. The corn chips were interesting and tasty, and salsas were perfectly spicy and different. Next I got the taco special, with tuna and shrimp tacos on corn tortillas. They were full of flavor, light, and so yummy, it reminded me of the tacos I have back at home, if not better. Very authentic coastal Mexican food!","A hidden gem in Uluwatu. I recommend the chicken quesadilla, shrimp taco, garlic mushroom taco, and the ceviche.

There are a few caf√©s that I liked walking to from the villa. The view from my bedroom was lush and so tranquil (they have black out curtains!!!!) the floor to ceiling windows also gave me some great light upstairs to just chill, read, work online.

There are heaps of good restaurants for breakfast and dinner a few minutes away too, but I loved driving my scooter around to the cliffs and beaches nearby. The owners are very sweet, helpful with suggestions too. Made some friends also since there is a spot or two near the main road where solo travelers can just go and hang in the evenings and meet other travelers and locals.

Anyway I loved my stay, I'd stay again.","One of my best holidays ever. Aside the amazing country Bali is, the stay in Villa Mola made it even more fantastic.
The sunset is amazing and staff has been so kind to us. They helped in renting scooters, taxis and organized our way to the airport.
If you are looking for an option in Bali, this one is perfect. Close to restaurants and beaches, the location is top.
Thank you for the unforgettable memories Villa Mola!",Loved staying at Villa Mola! The drive through nature to the villa was beautiful and the location had several great cafes and restaurants to eat at. The beach was near and the villa itself was beautiful! Some days we just spent hanging out in the Villa making food in their stocked kitchen and having beers by the pool. The beds are big and comfy and you'll wake up to a beautiful sunrise glow in the sky. The floor to ceiling windows are beautiful sunset also.
