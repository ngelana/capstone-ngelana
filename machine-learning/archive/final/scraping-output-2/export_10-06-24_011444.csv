The resort is well maintained. The resort staff are very friendly and approachable. Almost all of them speak good English.

Do check out their Rock Bar, which is very unique. Be sure to make a reservation for it in advance.","Hands down my favourite resort so far in Bali, it‚Äôs such a memorable location!

‚Ä¢ üåäThey have plenty of pools and activities to experience around the resort which you can freely travel between the different Ayana sister hotels.
‚Ä¢ ü•êThe breakfast buffet has a huge selection of delicious great quality dishes. I love the outdoor seating amongst the water garden. It‚Äôs very calming.

Just a little bit expensive üòÖ,Huge compound with natural green surroundings where you have to travel between locations on a tram. Incredible views from the pools and their spa villas was very tranquil which made me feel like I was transported to another world that is both enchanting and relaxing. Definitely a good hideaway from the hustle and bustle of Bali and worth a visit.,"Amazing hotel. It really was an experience to just be there.
The staff are very well trained, probably the best I have seen. The breakfast options are amazing and the cleanliness of hotel spot on.
Beautiful spa and grounds. The hotel was so beautiful we didn‚Äôt want to leave the hotel itself. We also had access to the other hotels within the grounds all beautiful. I would love to go hack there worth the money you pay.

A great place to see the sunset and enjoy the cool sea breeze.

Service was great. They provide umbrellas to shield the guests from the late afternoon Sun. Food and drink were just average, nothing special. People come for the ambience.

A small tip: don't sit too close to the water, because depending on the tide, you may get splashed by the waves.

As this is a very popular bar, reservation is a must.","Since we stayed at the resort, we had no trouble getting a spot at the bar. The first day was fantastic, with a beautiful view to enjoy. However, since we travelled during the wet season, it poured down like crazy. This was tough, especially for families with babies and children. The stairs were slippery too.

We decided to go back for more the next day. We booked early, but it was still a struggle to get the best spot because everyone wanted a view of the sunset. Plus, the sun was scorching! Almost everyone ended up with umbrellas provided from the bar.

Is it worth dining under the blazing weather? Well, for me I find the bar was worth it for the experience and the amazing view. The only downside was that the food options weren't that great, and it was only our second visit. But if you're thinking about checking out the Rock Bar, go for it!",Best view ever. They have a huge seating area with different angles of seaview. U can get plenty of nice pictures here. Better booked early if u want to secure a spot. I went quite early so it's very hot. The best time is right before sunset. Just go for a drink & light snack before dinner.,"Amazing location! Amazing Atmosphere and Amazing food !
We found this place by chances .... just wanted to try the food as some comments do have good review. Our surprise when we reached the place ! There are lifts to bring us down to the restaurant. Which they are located along the cliff. You'll get the chance to view the sunset and take countless photos. Make sure you could get a table from 6pm onwards... sure you'll catch the significant view while dinning and enjoying the food
The waiter and waitress provided excellent service.  Perfect place for a Valentine dinner","One of the places to visit for sunset.
Well trained staff, due to which they offer wonderful service.
Make sure you have enough time for this place as you have to walk a lot from parking as their property is big. Sometimes, during their peak hour, you will have to wait for your table for approx 15mins to 20mins"

Special thanks to the hotel staff who have helped us find the sunglasses we left in Rock Bar and even deliver back to our room!,"Definitely a 5 star hotel. Rooms were large and New and comfortable for a family of 2 adults 2 kids. Private and exclusive. Service is really top notch, one of the best we have experienced across the globe. Attentive and down to details. Would have given it full 5 stars if not for 2 points:
1) food and beverages were expensive. We would have spent more here if not because of exorbitant prices. And I think this is the case for most of your customers here whom can spend more but doesn't want to be ripped off.
2) funny noises at night. Stops around 10pm interestingly so wasn't too painful. Like knocks, bangs and water pipes.","For one of these large multi hotel operation it is very well run. Food is good. Clientele is what you would expect in such a large hotel. So great for a big place but if you like discreet, refined and small this is not for you.","For the price the value is far below expectation. I would strongly recomend another hotel. The beach is very bad, not a place were you feel good spending time. The breakfast was like a refugee camp with desperate people all over‚Ä¶not really ‚Äúdream place‚Äù.","Upon entering the Ayana Property you quickly realise you are in for a treat. The service is exceptional from the moment you arrive to the moment you depart. The overall experience is next level with so many quality appointments, from the gorgeous gardens to the breathtaking views and surprises around every corner. We had our welcome drinks at the rooftop bar looking out over the gorgeous property. We booked a room for 3 nights at the new Segara resort. The rooms are amazing, quiet, the air con is super cool, the beds are so comfortable and the bathrooms are fit for a king and queen. The toiletries fragrances smell so nice. We even had a fully stocked complimentary mini bar. I believe they have approximately 16 different pools to swim, our favourite was the cliff pool near rock bar. So much to see as the property is very large, you can take a free tram to all of the properties amenities, day spa  retreat, Jamu classes, beach clubs, beaches, the other Ayana resorts and restaurants and of course the famous sunset at the rock bar etc. too much to mention here. Overall highly recommended to book a stay."

The private pool was a highlight, offering a serene space to relax and unwind. The dining options were also outstanding, with delicious food served in a picturesque setting. Overall, Ayana Villas Bali exceeded all expectations and provided a perfect tropical getaway.","Our stay at Ayana Villas was the perfect romantic getaway. The villa was spacious and large, the private pool was at a perfect temperature, the bathroom was so dreamy and upon arrival there were petals already in the tub! There‚Äôs even an outdoor shower too. Highlights of the stay included the floating breakfast, the hydro jet pools and a must do activity is the sunset picnic experience on Kubu Beach. Ayana Villas definitely deserves 5 stars and I highly recommend it! Not only that, the staff were so incredibly lovely, attentive and kind tooü§©","Wow what can I even say! This was definitely another level of luxury. Initially we were a bit nervous as we didn‚Äôt know how we could justify the price when the other places were already 5 stars, wonderful and half the cost. But it was hands down worth the $$ for our special occasion. The service was unreal - we truly felt like royalty and were treated with the most exceptional service. We had a 24/7 butler who was contactable through WhatsApp. Whatever we needed, whenever we needed it we just text the butler and within a few minutes we were attended to. We were chauffeured in a private buggy and were privy to exclusive perks such as breakfast each morning at Dava. This restaurant omg I can‚Äôt even put into words how amazing the A La Carte menu is.
Absolutely best time here! 10/10 would recommend.","The first time I've lived at a villa and it was an exceptional one. One of the main highlights was the butlers, especially Arta who drove us around wherever we needed and was super hospitable. The property is amazing with beautiful pools and the famous Rock Bar. I understand the nature of the location (asking with tasty sweet drinks) but there were a lot of ants there. The villa we were in was very very beautiful and spacious and very well kept. We had the floating breakfast and it was quite instagram-able. The food itself was pretty good and filling. We also tried the massage pool which was really cool (left a separate review). This entire stay was definitely worth splurging on!","The perfect resort, with superb scenery and excellent service, thank you very much for the hard work of every staff member.

Sami sits right on the edge of a cliff, overlooking the Indian Ocean.
Book a table and ask to be seated right on one of the end tables. You won't regret the beautiful sunset views and photo opportunities.
Tonight was my 6th visit (first dining solo), and my waiter, Darma, looked after me. I ordered drinks, an entree and a main dish. Darma swapped over the complimentary bread and dipping oil to bread and butter. Bread is fresh and I'd happily eat baskets of that!
My arancini balls with an orange salad was tasty - the arancini's full of cheesy filling. My cannelloni main dish was so big I couldn't eat it all. Again, such a tasty meal in itself.
Well priced dishes, attentive staff (Darma was such an excellent server and full of information about the local area, including the new Saka museum) and a view that money can't buy.
If you're not into the nightclub feel of nearby Rock Bar and looking for a more family friendly or romantic meal, come to Sami Sami. You won't be disappointed.","I went with my family and we really liked everything. Service is excellent, the waiter was really friendly and was aware of my sisters food allergies all the time.
View and atmosphere is nice! I recommend it","Fabulous location to watch sunset much less people than in Rockbar, we enjoyed our evening so much despite the food we ordered were what you won't expect. We ordered two different risottos and both tasted and had a consistency of a rice pudding üòÇ It was edible but it wasn't a risotto at all. It is a complex dish so we can't complain, the pizza on the other table looked really good though. If you order food here maybe go for pasta or pizza, it is hard to fail.
I also had frozen mango daiquiri and it was delicious and a very large portion I could not finish it. I also tasted all their red wines that they sell by glass, they were very nice and gave me to try it first. Australian was the most drinkable.
While we were waiting for our food there was a nice ceremony in front of the restaurant.
Overall, we really enjoyed our evening at Sami.",If you know your food then you will understand that this is basic average staples with a bit of flash. Seriously overpriced for what you were getting. As much as I love this area they are basically ripping off the wealthier people because they can. Second time here but I‚Äôve had enough. Cannot complain about the service which is always great and location is stunning. They certainly have that going for them. If you decide to go then get a table close to the ocean view if you can and perhaps try one of the pasta dishes if you must go.

I wish they can provide more choice of red wine by glass in coming will be prefect.","Two reasons why this was the best meal we had in Bali - 1. It's airconditioned! That's just brilliant given the energy sapping humidity and heat in December.
2. It's the best Italian food I've had in years. Absolutely brilliant dishes from the octopus, to the squid ink risotto, the tagliatelli marinara, the crab ravioli, the pizza. Probably the best restaurant in ayana. Forget all the silly buffets... This is the real deal.
But... The Italian chef left a few weeks ago in  December 2023.... So I don't know how much longer the local ayana chefs will keep the standard of his food going. Get in quickly, it was such good Mediterranean / Italian and even Greek inspired food. The moussaka was excellent as well. There was some contention over the texture of the octopus... I enjoyed it, my father didn't - but the flavour was still very good.
The portions were decent... But don't expect an Italian  Mamas serving sizes. I would go back again but this was our last meal in Bali tonight. Outstanding meal, excellent service and live music as well from an acoustic trio.","Live music is played from Wednesday to Sunday. I had a lovely dinner outdoors hearing a nice  performance and eating delicious food. Indoor is a little bit more formal and outdoors is a little more cosy. Octopus was outstanding, surf and turf was a nice combo and finally mango lava cake to close this lovely dinner. Wawan and Cindy were super nice and friendly as well as the whole staff. Thank you","Best mediterranean restaurant I have ever tried so Far..
Quality of the food and service. I Will back absolutely!
The ravioli and the octopus are a must! Also the ""scusa punch"" was so refreshing! Good Job!!
Thank You!!","We had an impeccable dinner at Scusa for my birthday in August 2023, which included a serenade by the live musicians plus a birthday dessert and card from the staff.

Beyond these niceties, the staff are so accommodating and polite, and the design of the hotel is gorgeous. Most importantly, the food is delicious, with some of the best chicken I have tasted outside of my favourite country for chicken, Peru - and that was from the kids menu! I had the spicy sausage pizza and it was the perfect balance of dough, sauce and sausage.

This was a memorable night for our family and we absolutely will be back the next time we come to Bali.

A special shout out to Listiani who was our waitress for the evening.

Final note: do yourself a favour and try the Butterscotch Martini!"
