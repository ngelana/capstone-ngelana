All major faith and religions are represented in one strip. A mosque stands next to a Catholic church, next to a Buddhist temple, next to a Protestant church next to Hindu temple.

This place is a testament to Bali's promotion of respect to all faith and religion.","Amazing place in Nusa Dua where different religious buildings in one place side by side. Hindu temple, Christian church, Buddhist temple and Muslim  mosque. There are moderate dress codes to enter the temples ( we visited the Hindu temple and Buddhist temple ) needs to cover legs if you wear short pants. We visited during weekday and not many people there. It is free to visit ( no entry fees).",Great to see all the world religions peacefully side by side. Good example of Balinese openess and welcoming atmosphere! Dont forget to weer appropriate clothing.,"This is a place where religions co-exist, you have a mosque, Buddhist temple, Catholic Church all on one site, and you can visit each of them and pray or just explore.

The toilets and the abolition place are clean and spacious.",Beautiful masjid. Jummah time is 1210. It was great to see a temple both Hindu and Buddhist along with the church in the same complex.

We felt very welcomed and their hospitality was top notch!! They were always helpful and even brought our GRAB food that we ordered to our room door when we were a bit late to pick them up.

In terms of the room and its cleanliness, we would rate it 8.5 - 9 out of 10. As it is exposed to nature, one cannot run away from lizard droppings as there were about 5-6, which is understandable. A little freshener might also help, to give a nice smell upon entering the villa.

Nevertheless, I will definitely come and stay again in future - for the vibrant employees and the hospitality showcased. Thank you for having us üôè","To be honest, I didn't like the location as much,but this place is absolutely worth every penny. Love it."

Housekeeper Ayu and Guide Wayan were also excellent. This was our first trip to Bali and we appreciated all the local knowledge and recommendations that were shared. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!","Bali villa 4U is the best villa that I saw in this district. I think it is the best value for money!
Villa has all items for comfortable holidays, a big swimming pool, 3 huge bedrooms with king-size beds, a massage table, a perfect kitchen with a spacious fridge and different kitchen equipment. The room on the second floor has a beautiful view. The leaving room is great with smart TV and a great sound system! Honestly, often we didn't want to leave the villa and we had dinner at home. Also, instead go to a beach we preferred to stay at the villa's swimming pool :)
Regarding the atmosphere and comfortable in the room: there is air conditions in each room, but I was afraid to get cold and tried didn't use it, but 2 rooms have panoramic doors to 2 sides it is allowed to make a draft with fresh air. So, I strongly recommended this villa!
Also, about owners, Peter and Chrissie is very hospitable and helpfully. I think Peter can solve any question in Bali and He can give tons of helpful advice about places and services. I was surprised by their goodness and openness.","A fantastic place for a family getaway! All the family enjoyed our time spent at this spacious villa. The young ones loved the private pool. The beds were comfy and the living area was big enough for all six of us to share in comfort. Peter and Chrissy are fantastic hosts and went out of their way to make all the family feel at home and make our stay very memorable.
Even organised a birthday cake then delivered it to the restaurant for us!","My husband and 2 friends of ours stayed in the villa for 13 nights. It is a spacious, fully equipped villa with a private pool, truly magnificent. The beds were very comfortable and it was serviced each day by Nyoman and Made, who were always so polite and friendly. Wayan, our driver, was excellent, knows Bali very well and was always so very accommodating. It was our first time in Bali and we all say thank you to Peter and Chrissie, they were so helpful and considerate that when our trip came to an end, it felt like we were parting with friends.","This is Villa is amazing.
