The location is unreal - one of the most gorgeous settings my husband and I have ever seen. Absolutely perfect place for our honeymoon! The food was delicious and incredibly reasonably priced, especially considering the remote location. The staff is beyond amazing - friendly and accommodating doesn’t even begin to cover it. They think of everything, even delivering homemade cookies to each room every night. The room was big, clean, and well-appointed. We had the couples spa by the river - don’t miss this one, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience!! Yoga along the rice field is fantastic and included, just tell the desk you’re coming. This is the most peaceful, quiet, zen place we have ever been.","Staff: 5
Services: 2
I had to flush my toilet several times as there was not enough water pressure. Jaccuzi jets didn’t work well and water was not hot enough. Pool size is not big enough for such a big hotel.
Location: 4
far away from everything so would be good place for people who prefer a quiet place.
I recommend this place for old couples who prefer to stay away from hustle and bustle of the city but they need to know that there are lots of stairs for them as well.","Incredible location, helpful kind and attentive staff. The reception staff are happy to answer any as about local culture and to offer advice about onward travel, which was invaluable. Really grateful to everyone that made our stay so wonderful!
The yoga sessions at sunset are super nice, the yoga teacher is fantastic!
The restaurant was very good, too - both for breakfast and for dinner. They were very helpful with dietary requirements and intolerances.
Communication re e.g. jacuzzi not being operational when on maintenance could be improved.
Overall, wonderful place and wonderful people!
Thank you!!","I just experienced a traditional full Balinese body massage, and it was absolutely heavenly! The therapist NARI was incredibly skilled, using a variety of techniques that left me feeling deeply relaxed and rejuvenated. The atmosphere was serene, with soothing music and a beautifully decorated room and frangipani flowers,  that really enhanced the whole experience. This was more than just a massage; it was a holistic therapy session that balanced both body and mind. Highly recommended for anyone needing a touch of tranquility and healing!","I had a bad experience with the Front Desk service. The staff Yori sent me wrong information about the price of the room between the Panoramic and the Garden room and made me paid extra 4mill. Thought she gonna fixed the problem by connected me with the reservation departement but its actually didn’t help at all I got only non stop sorry sorry sorry… from both of them. Yori decided to give massages service for free for 2 persons at spa with value 350ribu rupiah /person. Such a nice gesture but still I feel dissapointed… ☹️

Been staying with their sister company Hangging Garden before covid time it went great. So I was thought Nandini will as profesional as their sister company."

The access to the canyon and tirtha pools below is worth the stay.

The rooms were sub-standard for this price point, although again if it is the jungle atmosphere you are looking for the view over the river gorge is really spectacular. The room we had just seemed to lack in general cleaning and airing out. The bedclothes and window seat were damp and musty, the room was dusty. Just seemed lacking in general upkeep. We also had a dying rat in our room one of the evenings. I have no problem with the regular jungle creatures, but rats in the room hint there is a larger rodent problem.

Was also disappointed that they advertised ""natural pools"" but that did not apply to the central hotel pool, it was so overly chlorinated that I couldn't stand to swim in it for more than a minute.

Beautiful location, but not really worth it for the price.","I MUST give this place a 5* but so tempted to give less as they promote elephant riding! No Pramana! Not OK! Please stop doing this.

This place blew me away. Considering the low number of lodges that it has, it’s huge and still maintains a lovely vibe and doesn’t feel empty or soulless.

The not so good things: the food is hit and miss e.g. the half of duck had almost zero meat, the banana fritters were soggy etc. But then the katsu rice bowl (one day served hot, another day served luke-warm) and the rendang are amazing!
Service in the restaurant is friendly but the staff are inattentive. Almost all my meals I had to go up to the bar to ask for this or order another wine, because they don’t pay attention or check on you.
Location-wise, this place is really far from anything. But that’s probably why it’s such good value for money and why you have such a wonderful jungle-experience. It is possible to get Grabs but it can take a little while to secure one / for them to arrive.

The great things: If you like the sights and sounds of the jungle this is the place for you. You’re completely enveloped in the serenity of nature. Set in a small valley with a (I’m told ‘legendary’) river running through it, it’s just so peaceful and accessible. Despite being in the jungle they do a good job at keeping the mosquitoes at bay.
Every day you are invited to a complimentary Balinese afternoon tea. How wonderful.
Every day they have a free activity e.g. a guided walking tour up the canyon etc. This tour is scheduled for Wednesday but I thought it was Thursday. When the reception staff saw I was disappointed I missed it they organised a private tour for me the following day for free. How amazing of them.
Every day at breakfast (it’s a la carte) you’re presented with a lot of food, and you can have what ever you like.

The rooms – oh the rooms. How fabulous. Four-poster beds with such comfortable mattress and pillows, huge bathroom with hot, powerful shower, lovely lighting. They’re quiet and well kept with private balconies (not overlooked at all), oh they’re just so dreamy. They’re cleaned daily and even a turn down service later afternoon – which includes lighting coils to shoo away the insects. I would however say that the rooms aren’t very ‘proofed’ (both noise and other) – 2 nights in a row we had a mouse or rat or such like rummaging through our bags in the middle of the night. The sounds of the rainforest can also be extremely loud all night. But despite poor sleep for 4 days, this place is still a 5* to me.

The staff throughout are so friendly and kind, especially the reception and cleaning staff – they can’t do enough to make your stay special.
It really felt quite magical and special and yet such good value for money esp. with breakfast and afternoon tea involved, and how special the accommodation is.

We were really sad to leave but have booked the Pramana on Nusa Penida so hoping for the same experience.",It would be nice if you really like to enjoy the nature.  All the staff are very friendly and helpful. The room is beautifully designed as well. But the location is bit far from Ubud center.,"Stayed in the double villa with private pool for 8 nights at a total cost of $3300 AUD. 8 nights is a bit too long I would stay max of 4 nights. This villa has the largest footprint of all the accommodation wings and it's this spaciousness that makes it just that little bit nicer. The location is absolutely insane. You are literally on top of a canyon overlooking the jungle. Cannot describe it in words you have to see it for yourself. The staff were incredibly polite, helpful and quick to respond though there were occasions where their business procedures make it more costly for tourists - I would suggest arranging a private driver and organising any tours you wish to do in Ubud which is approx 20 mins away. There were literally no mosquitoes for us but there are plenty of lizards, frogs and geckos that like to pay you a visit in your rooms. Note there is an additional 21% service charge at this hotel so if you're tipping, don't go towards the higher end.  If management are reading this, I would suggest a small table and chairs in the rooms for people to sit at. We had to eat room service food sitting on the floor because there is nowhere to sit and I don't like to eat where I sleep.","Absolutely incredible!! Beautiful energy from everyone who works here, the front desk people, spa, and restaurant people were all the kindest and most welcoming and had such attention to detail. My husband and I had the best time here. From the moment we got there, the lovely receptionists and the beautiful traditional music and welcome tea had us instantly in heaven.

Every little detail of the hotel rooms are beautiful, let alone view of the river and soothing sounds. The bathrooms are incredible. They can arrange a driver from the hotel to take you around for the day. The area is much less touristy and more local which I loved and there are lots of beautiful hikes and waterfalls around to check out.

I can't wait to go back here!! Thank you so much to all the staff for the best memories"
