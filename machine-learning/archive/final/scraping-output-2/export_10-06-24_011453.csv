You should try this atleast for once.
It is so good that we had our lunch here thrice.
Ordered coconut water which had so much water that it will be enough for 2.
They added peanuts to their dish and it brought the taste to another level.

The staff is super nice. They have good food, but don't expect gourmet quality. There is a fresh fruit market across the road, plenty of local restaurants nearby and a few supermarkets.","They claim to have good ratings but this place is really dilapidated. Booked 4 nights here during the new year’s festivities. Room was located on the second floor facing the pool and by 7am it sounds like a school yard with kids screaming and swimming.

We booked this place only because it was the only one available on such short notice in Jimbaran area that was relatively affordable (price was up 3 folds cuz of NYE). Honestly there are sooo many other hotels that are newer within the area that one can look into instead - like infinity8 and the price is more or less the same.

Stayed here because we wanted to be central in terms of location due to immense traffic during NYE. Purely for convenience, which is the perk of staying here. Takes you 20 mins to Uluwatu and Melasti Beach m and 30 mins to Seminyak, 10 mins to the airport (all by bike)and we were hardly in the room - just to shower and sleep.

AC was great, there’s hot water but, I did not at all get any peaceful sleep during my stay here with kids screaming first thing in the morning.

Also it’s super run down. There’s a damp smell in the room, the towels are old. Don’t look at the corners of the room if you hate the sight of grime and mold.

The staff are friendly and  accommodating. The only downer of this place really is just the place itself.

But like I shared earlier, we stayed here because it was the only one in the area available under short notice. We still ended up paying USD260 for the 4 nights when you can easily get something a lot nicer elsewhere (but bear in mind again this was NYE).","Only issue I had, is previous customers smoked in the room and I had to change it due to the strong smell. They sorted out immediately as soon as I reported.","Great hotel that is really good value for money. Rooms are clean and tidy, great air conditioning and English movie channels on the TV. Restaurant is located on the ground floor near the pool and often is out of stock so to get food off the many in the room is difficult. All the staff are welcoming and very helpful. Location is ok but suggest having a motor bike so can access near by attractions with ease. I will be staying here again in the near future.",My home away from home (before I have a flight out of Bali). I love staying here before a flight. I always go to Lia’s cafe and have a fat fish the night before I leave Bali.

Unfortunately, I encountered a significant issue during the night, as the water supply was disrupted for the entire night. This inconvenience was exacerbated by the fact that there was no night staff available to figure the situation promptly. I attempted to contact the front desk several times, but there was no response throughout the night.

Moreover, when the morning arrived, I expected a swift resolution to the water problem. However, the response time was surprisingly slow, and it took an unreasonably long period for someone to figure the issue. This situation not only disrupted my sleep but also caused unnecessary frustration and inconvenience.

I understand that unforeseen circumstances can occur, but the lack of a timely response and the absence of night staff are matters that need urgent attention to ensure the well-being and satisfaction of your guests.

I kindly request that you investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate measures to prevent such incidents in the future.

I trust that you value feedback from your guests and will take the necessary steps to improve the quality of service at your establishment. Thank you!","The only good think it's the view from the room.

The hotel is in degradation, need urgent maintenance, as keep closed for 3 years during the plandemic and didn't do any maintainable before opening.

You must keep sure conditioned all the time open with the noise because otherwise there is zero ventilation in the room, will be sweaty and without oxygen if keep the window closed to avoid the external noise, so in either way full of noise.

Dirty bed linens, wasn't changed and need to ask to be changed. And dirty room in general.

Juts avoid","unsatisfactory service. the air conditioner was off overnight, I complained to the receptionist but there was no solution. In fact, I was given advice to open the balcony door to allow air circulation, even though it was still the middle of the night and they knew there was a baby in the room

So helpful isn’t it? 🙃","The service was great but the staff need learn more English, so the communication would be better. The price was pretty good but the rooms are not like the pictures. They are so much old. It wasn’t clean good neither. It is obvious that they haven’t done a deep cleaning for a long time.  I am talking about walls, windows, bathroom and its tiles as well as the toilet itself.  There was no hand towel or soap either. If they improve this it would be much better.","We were unfortunately very disappointed by our stay here. The photos of the room we booked were not the same as the one online. The pool also looked nothing like the photos and seemed so dirty I didn’t wanna go in. The room was not very clean especially the bathroom. It was extremely moldy in the shower and look as if it had never been clean. The bathroom smelt so awful I didn’t even want to use it. The house keeping wasn’t very good and we ran out of toilet and they never stocked it. However, the front desk staff was nice. Would not stay here again."

There are pictures on the internet and on their website are noting a like. In reality it's looks very different. The hotel is very old and has not been on any service at all.
Almost anything that you can find in a hotel room are filthy and sticky. The paint on the walls and doors are falling off. In one of the rooms, we stayed there is mold underneath the toilet seat. When you want to take a shower, you must hold the showerhead in your hand, since there is not a holder for the showerhead at all.

If you want to swim there is a swimming pool on the fourth floor, except that the pool is 6 feet deep, even so you can't see the bottom of the pool, since the pool isn't clean in years."

It not as spicy as Nasi Ayam Bu Oki. The taste is same as other Nasi Ayam Kadewatan Bu Mangku. I am the fan of Nasi Ayam Kadewatan Ubud.

The different with other branches, the waiters are noisy. Shout each other. Little bit annoying 😅🫢. Need more training for the waiters.

The parking area is huge. No worries on car parking space 👍","Visited Nasi Ayam Kedewatan Ibu Mangku in my way to Ngurah Rai Airport. I ordered Nasi Ayam Kedewatan which consist of Rice, Ayam Betutu, Lawar, Nuts, Sate Lilit, Egg, tiny cute pack of ‘Pepes Tahu’, Fried Chicken Skin to add more crispy texture to the plate, and Sambal called Sambal Embe. For take away order, they provide separate ‘kuah’ in a little cute bottle, which is very proper to make sure it doesn’t spill

Important note about the taste, this was very good and not as spicy as Nasi Ayam Bu Oki. Every elements from the nasi ayam complete each other so the taste was amazing and fragrant.
The service is quick and friendly. When I came here, it was not so crowded

So I recommend you to taste it whenever you have a chance to visit Bali! :)","Since I was doin the delivery for breakfast, I can’t rate the service and atmosphere at the resto. But I have to admit that the tipat surprised me.

- 10pcs of grilled clams, fresh, medium size, the sauce so rich and flavorful, went really well with the smokey-charred aroma. you guys can not miss this one
- 4 pcs of grilled prawn, medium size flavorful, but somehow I am not a big fan of it, because i couldn't feel the sweetness of fress seafood in it, not bad, tho, just not that prefect
- 4 pcs of squid skewers, a bit overcooked but again their marination and bumbu were to die for. Just like the prawns, I missed the sweetness of a fresh seafood with the squid.
- 2 plate of nasi putih, well cooked.
- 2 type of sambal: sambal matah fresh, but i wish the citrus flavor could kick a bit harder. and one other sambal smooth and spicy, my favorite.
- kangkung plecing. If there is an award for the best supporting dish, this is IT. The kangkung was tender, spicy but not that much. Amazing and generous flavor. love it.

The place is lovely, but there is no aircon ok, and bali always hot. 🤗✌🏻😊😊😊😊😊.","Nice cozy place to have dinner in the open air. The service was quick and very friendly, pizzas and bruschetta we ordered were very tasty, just the right crust for the pizzas. Pizza Capricciosa was delicious, we also had a nice Panna cotta dessert. Beer was also available, perhaps an addition of Radler would be a good selection option. Appreciate for the lady managing the place, very friendly and attentive.",A very good tasty experience. I ordered spaghetti meatballs...a real italian taste. Staff excellent in suggesting me some recipes instead of order a pizza.,"Great Italian restaurant in Jimbaran.
The pepperoni pizza is amazing, but not only.
The pasta is fresh, hand made, and only top-quality ingredients are used.

The atmosphere is very relaxed with a cover area and a garden area (apply mosquito repellent!).

Umberto, the owner, is a great guy, very friendly, and always making sure you have everything you need.

Prices are very reasonable.

A favorite. Will go back."

Once you come in, there is a store, mostly with all different kinds of meats and seafood you didn't even know existed, in all price ranges.
There, you can choose exactly the piece of meat you want to eat, you bring it upstairs and there is a restaurant where they know exactly how to cook it so it tastes the best.
Completely customizable, but if you don't feel like choosing yourself, they can of course choose for you!
Atmosphere was very nice, perfect decoration, kind and fast service.
It is also kid friendly, we came in with 7 months old baby, and they provided us with baby chair, which our son happened to really like!","The best steak & grill - western style food in Jimbaran area.
With live music every Friday night.
You can buy fresh meat, fish, vegetables and lots of choices of import product at the meat shop area.","One of the best places to get a steak in Bali, the first floor is a store while the second and third floors comprise of the restaurant.","Supermarket (meat house) with the restaurant on the upper building.
Proper steak restaurant, quite expensive but worth the money.
You choose the meat, and they will cook it for you. There are a lot of meat options, you better ask the staff for recommended one.
Side dish is not included, so you have to order separately.
The security and the staffs are nice 👍🏻"

We ordered plain croissant, also loves.

Staff were so friendly, toilet was clean. 👍🏻

The downside was just some bule were crazily park their bike behind our car in the parking lor and ignorantly pretend not knowing we were gonna leave the cafe and not moving the bikes!! So the staff helped. But that was not the staffs fault. Appreciate the staff helpfulness. Only some crazy bule acting out. 🥲","the iced coffee is pretty strong!

toilet is clean, staffs r friendly, there's wifi too","Walked to this cafe from the Immigration Centre after extending my visa. The wifi was fast enough to complete my work and upload the project. There are plenty of plug sockets. I ordered a cappuccino with oat milk and the double shot to milk ratio was good. Most importantly, the cafe cleanliness was noticeable. The music was not jarring so I was able to concentrate and the A/C is excellent. The baristas were all lovely and very attentive to your needs.","Hello, this place is really nice, its very cool in here, kudos to ac working to its maximum.

However, the lasagna brought was cold, not that good. Its better to eat nuggets with sauce cuz they seem a little bland.

The croissant with salmon was nice and overall it seems like a nice place","It's a simple and nice coffee shop in the corner. They served a full glass of nice long black ice, mine is robust and it taste strong! The fish and chips was nice also, the dish menu is western style"

Aren latte is good, use 100% arabica coffee beans. Got free pia and peach ice tea ❤️❤️❤️","Great place to get coffee and relax, they offer a private meeting room as well.","I come to work here and so far it’s one of the best places I’ve found.

Wi-Fi is fantastic, also one of the most stable connections I have found.

Order cappuccino and mochaccino
Mochaccino is decent but cappuccino too watery
Maybe have some improvements on the future for coffee"

Nice place, good ambience, friendly staff, good food with reasonable price.  This place is suitable when you are waiting for your partner at the salon.","Espresso was very good, and the side cookie as well.
I gave only 4 stars because the coffee cup was cold.
This is a very big mistake for a quality espresso.

I suggest that they need to place the cups on the top side of the coffee machine so the steam will warm them. It's made for that.

In Italy the espresso is served in a hot cup, around 60 65 degrees.","Here for brunch at 10. To answer to few review i seen before i get here, this place aircon is working perfectly fine. Unless you choose to sit outdoor then its up to the weather. Its warmer as it get nearer to noon.
Coffee here is an equal ratio of arabica & robusta (50:50). One who like tubruk coffee would love this. Not as smooth as a full arabica, but it gives you a stronger caffeine to kick start your day. I personally would tolerate up to 70:30, but this one is quite ok. Low in acidity, a lil bit bitter.","If you're looking for a quiet place, this is one of the place you can choose. It is quiet small but I think that's not a problem.
I came here to read a book (I bring a book) and I can read it peacefully, the other customers are also working or study (maybe), mostly foreigners.
Have an outdoor and an indoor, so you got option when you want to smoke.
Ordered an ice coffee and a platter, a bit pricey but worth to try.

Really good service, especially our waitress Karmi she’s very patient and well explain about the menu.
Special thanks to the chefs because the food is great.
They have special lava cake too. You should try guyss.
Very recommended.","I just came from Camino for dinner. I'm looking for pasta that I never tried before, It called frutti de mare. I also tried the dessert called molten lava cake. The taste of the pasta was good but there is something wrong with the prawn and I already told them. I just want them to be more careful about their food presentation in the future. They handled it professionally and say sorry towards me. They also want to give me dessert as compensation for the mistake but I didn't take it cause I was full. I just said that they can have it and that's okay. I'm not kind of person that will give a bad review without a strong reason. The dessert was really good, it's amazing and I really like it. Usually I ate the molten lava cake in my favorite restaurant called The Brass but it's so far away from my home now. So I'm looking for alternative and find Camino. Definitely, I'll comeback for the dessert called molten lava cake 🫶🏻","Everything was great! Food, service & the decor! Lots of choices on the menu. Highly recommend 🫶🏼🫶🏼","“I had a delightful dining experience at this small restaurant. The friendly staff, including our attentive waiter Carmen, made us feel right at home. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, and the restaurant was impeccably clean.
