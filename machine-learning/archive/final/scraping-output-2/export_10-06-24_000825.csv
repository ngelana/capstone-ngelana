But the mount Agung's view is spectacular! You may have to climb into somewhere higher than main road or use the drone for best viewing experience. You have to arrive here in early morning or late afternoon, to catch the best view from this little gem.","One of my favorite spots in Bali ðŸ”¥ The sunrise views of Mount Agung from this spot are insane!!

ig: @mattremblay_",This is likely the best place to view Agung for free. We ventured out here after finding it on Google and it didn't disappoint. The Bali Asli Restaurant next to it is the perfect place to chill while enjoying the view. I would recommend coming here in early morning. When we got there it was already 9:30 - 10. We still got a beautiful view but Agung was partially blocked.,"Worth stopping it in the east of Bali, though there are quite a few places to get a good view of Agung. We just stopped at the side of the road, some people go into fields to get an â€˜Instagramâ€™ shot, but not easy with fences to get in and not sure how much the locals appreciate it!",Nice little viewpoint to see Mt Agung (when it's not cloudy) and rice paddies.

We ordered food for 3 and would suggest ordering for two as the portions were large and we could not eat all of it.  The staff happily arranged for Takeaway containers of banana leaf.  Could do with ceiling.fans to make the dining experience more enjoyable.  Loved everything about the authentic Balinese food.  And the view of Mount Agung speaks foe itself.  Wow!",Did the cooking class loved it from going to the local market to cooking the dishes and best of all eating what you made loved it highly recommend it,"I have to say how incredible the cooking class was and how everyone, even the non-cooks amongst us, enjoyed it. This is a must do activity!

Dewa seems to have been born for the role of teacher, he approached it with a concise and restrained delivery that masked a deep knowledge that rose to the occasion with every question directed at him. It was a lovely narration that didn't drift into long-windedness and push us to become overwhelmed. The huge upside was that we retained most of what he was telling us. He was animated and seemed to really enjoy what he was doing.

Dewa was assisted by Ayu who was also a delight. You can not half tell she was taught English by Australians. She was incredible in helping my brother, who has Alzheimer's, navigate the various tasks throughout the day. For that, I am eternally grateful. In fact, all of the Bali Asli staff were wonderful.

We started at 8am with the Amlapura market tour was the perfect start to the day. It's a beautiful market that is both clean and organised. We're currently going through this period of incredible humidity, so the market also presented quite a cool respite. Super interesting going through the different sections, daging, sayur, buah, satay, bunga and back.

My sister-in-law, who has taught cooking to senior school students all her working life and who has taken all of the 'name-brand' cooking classes in Bali previously, said this was by far the best she had done. In fact, she went so far as to say it was the best class she had ever done in all of her travels through Asia.

By 2pm we were all done and the last wok was turned off and to now be presented with all of the dishes we'd just prepared, was incredible. The recipes are so delicious in themselves that it was some of the most delicious Balinese food we'd eaten. I for one will embark on making my own Bumbu Bali later this week so that I have it there to add to dishes on a regular basis. It really was great to see how Bumbu Bali is the common thread in Balinese cooking","Went to Bali Asli to attend one day cooking class experience and everything exceeded my expectations. From the welcoming drink to the grocery and spices shopping at the market accompanied by chef Desi to the indoctrination and explanations of Bali foods and ingredients and finally the cooking class of 5 dishes, Balinese style. All concluded with eating the various dishes we prepared with only the freshest ingredients. Desi is a great teacher and transmits his passion for Bali traditions and Bali food.",The food is good is great and the staff is very nice and rhe view is just wow. The experience is interesting because you can try multiple dishes. The price was 40$ for 2 persons which is way above average.
