ChIJN455yFKH0S0R5TQfVpbOOBM,Manigelang Villa,-8.3039068,115.07736949999999,"Unnamed Road, Gesing, Kec. Banjar, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81154, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=1385084030501729509,OPERATIONAL,+62 896-8807-1392,lodging,lodging,5,61,,"Perfect.  I only booked for 2 days, but I regretted booking for a week at once.  It's always fully booked in advance.  The room is very clean and spacious.  Everything is carefully prepared in the room, including shampoo, conditioner, soap, several tissues, and many pillows and cushions.  The food is also delicious.  The surrounding scenery is indescribably healing.","Lovely villa high up in the mountains in the North of Bali. Super welcoming and friendly family and staff. Excellent for solo travelers. The food (vegetarian) is amazing! The energy there is simply beautiful. Had really nice conversations with the owners and they took me to some of the most beautiful places in Bali. They went far and beyond to make me feel right at home. The location is remote so it‚Äôs really a getaway high up in the mountains.
Their best room is the one-bedroom villa. Big and beautiful view! Some days you are literally in the clouds as they enter the villa üòÅ Unforgettable experience ‚ù§Ô∏è","Best experience for introvert & family people ever. Humble owners and interesting conversation. Sunset spiced with magic & really nice (quite unexpected/unusual fusion cuisine) vegetarian dinner. Definitely coming back one day. Still haven‚Äôt checked Buddha temple on top of the hill.
P.S.: there is no bathtub anymore but we were totally fine with shower. And road is a bit tricky so drive slowly on a low-gear mode and don‚Äôt forget to beep near every blind turn :)","The place is out of this world. Very unusual in its layout. Very positive energies: I was carried. Not counting the amazing view. The hosts are very kind. A special connexion occured with Ibu Kasih who holds her name so well (give). You feel at home, in a very warm atmosphere, as if you were part of family. I met very interesting people there. I will go back as soon as I have the opportunity.","A beautiful villa to stay in the remote hills of Bali.

We used this as our base to walk up Sangiyan Mountain. It was an ideal location, a fantastic villa where the hosts were exceptional.

Thank you for everything"
