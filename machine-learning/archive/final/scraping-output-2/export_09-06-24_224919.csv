Banjar, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81152, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=14108865718790502249,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3682-8228,,lodging,4.6,295,,A spectacular bungalow experience. No Yanks to make your ears bleed with their loud voices. A beautiful country retreat. Mostly quiet understanding guests. Magic infinity pool.,"The view is amazing and the people are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and stylish.

Breakfast is fine and dinner is very good.

Only downside is the location near the road. At night you will hear motorcycles and cars. Also roosters and barking dogs. So my advice is to bring a set of earplugs. The gas heater for the shower is inside the bathroom. So you will smell the fumes at first. The stairs to the rooms are steep, so not ideal if you have trouble walking or if you are not that fit.

Nearby you can walk through beautiful rice fields. Within a few minutes by scooter or car, you can also visit waterfalls.

In my opinion a good stay for 2 or 3 days.","Large, clean rooms with hot showers; incredible mountain side views with a lovely small pool; beautiful, friendly staff and good food...this was my favourite home stay of my 5 weeks in Indonesia!

There is much to do near by, plenty of delicious warungs in the area, and you can chase waterfalls all day!",Very nice hotel in Munduk with small clean bungalows with stunning view on the valley and mountains. Very friendly and nice staff. Wonderful fruit juices. Breakfast is not big but very tasty. The restaurant for dinner is nice and very good price. The swimming pool is small but in a superb position. Rooms a bit old but very clean.,"Small but beautiful, well kept property. It has a small swimming pool overlooking the valley. The rooms were like small cottages, outside the room sitting area with chairs was with a nice view. The food was good as well. You could also go in for a massage service at additional cost ofcourse."

I felt like I was living in a treehouse. The staff went above and beyond and the food was fabulous. Great value for money. Bonus that it was adult based accommodation which meant absolute serenity.,"Had a lovely two night stay here. The rooms are spacious and thoughtfully decorated. Great pool with an amazing jungle view. The staff are really kind and helpful, and they serve a tasty breakfast.","The resort is good with a mountain view, but has ants in the room and it's a bit uncomfortable to sleep with ants. Cleanliness is the issue. Vehicle noise as it is a road side property even at night.","The best welcoming with my husband‚Äôs birthday ! Thank you
About the room, it was raining and there was 200% humidity in the room and no A/C. However there was a good hot shower and the view from the pool is beautiful.
You can rent a scooter around 70k if you are a good negotiator (but first it was 90k).
The restaurant is a bit expensive, like 65k for one main course.
The breakfast is good, we always take an omelette and it was delicious and sufficient.","We felt very welcome from the beginning of our stay. The accomodation is nice for the price you pay. The bed was really good, but the shower was cold and not very clean. The view from the swimming pool was amazing and we can recommend going to the warung on the other side of the road. The service was really good. We decided late in the evening that we wanted to see the dolphins at lovina beach. This was no problem for Sudi. He arranged everything very well. In fact, he was there at the beach very early in the morning to make sure that we would find the boat and that everything was ok. He even bought us breakfast. Also the driver he arranged for us, Putu, was amazing. He drove us all around, was very friendly and showed us additional places. We really enjoyed our stay!"

The prices were excellent, especially considering the quality of the food. We ate here two days in a row we enjoyed it so much. The view was wonderful and the staff very friendly and welcoming.","When you are in the area, you really need to have a meal here... and make sure you sit upstairs. The view is incredible. The food is delicious. Lots to choose from on the menu. We had 2 late afternoon/ sundowner meals there. Would definitely recommend.",Very very good food and amazing location.. üôèüèº and good prices too!
