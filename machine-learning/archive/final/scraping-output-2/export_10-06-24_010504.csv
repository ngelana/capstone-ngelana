When I entered, one thing I noticed was that the outside and inside the building was very clean and tidy. Inside the building, starting from the backstage, audience seats, stage, operator's room and other facilities are in good condition. It's just that there are some audience seats that in my opinion are not in the right position (too on the side) so they don't get a good view of the stage.
Other than that, there is also a parking lot that is quite adequate, and can be easily reached without looking around the building, outside the building there is also a canteen that sells various foods and snacks.
