My booking includes breakfast but I don't get any. The room is dirty, with no toilet paper, bad room, and toilet is in bad condition, and no wifi for me. So so many mosquitoes in the room. And no staff around if you need any help.",Very nice and cozy place in a small village on the coast. Perfect for a relaxing stay and lot of activities around !,"Very nice place, highly recommended. So don't hesitate to order it.",Shower and toilet outside not in really good condition,

The area is very quiet. But the greatest value of this place are people. Staff is extra friendly, they do great effort to make us feel welcomed and taken care of.","Hot water is not working well and the rain wet the towels, towel hangers and tissue papers in the outdoor shower/toilet. We went out for dinner and came back with large lizard poops on the white sheets. Alot of noises from the roof. Wifi is working well, but since it is the month of Ramadhan for Muslims, can hear the call of prayers and chanting before sunrise and deep into the night.","Very nice place. Not a lot going on in the area though. You can organize trips to Menganjan, most of the other tourist business & beaches are in Pemuteran which is 10km away.","The room was clean and had everything we needed. Outdoor bathroom with hot water. Bed was comfortable, and aircon worked a treat. The hosts were friendly and let us leave our bags in the room for an extra couple of hours while we went out for brunch. The only slight downside was the share kitchen - it was a little dirty.","The room was clean and the service was very good. Good WiFi, close to the beach where snorkeling and diving near menjangan island is great. The owner also showed me the hot spring where the locals go which was amazing. In general if I am ever in the neighborhood this is were I will stay again!"

Google took us on a wild goose chase through a small village and on terrible roads (which was unnecessary). Several locals told us this place was closed. We found some mangroves but mostly surrounded by salt farms. Maybe the conservationists lost the battle to protect the mangroves üò¢. If this is your organisation, please let folks know if you still exist and how to find you, we were very keen to support conservation efforts in Bali.",Mangroves conservation is all they need.,"Recommended place,,  beautiful and educational place at a time. It's have mangroves that u can plant it by u'r self, bamboos bridge through mangroves,  dive spots, etc. Good enough for new conservation area.","Nice...
Amazing...
Exelent place to release our bored.
Big layer of white sand with plenty of mangrove surrounding in the tranquil place, just create a Peace.
Big wishes, spirit, big willing and togetherness from all people involved in this project is another site of the view at this area.
Go a head...NCF PUTRI MENJANGAN","Very nice mangrove, coral reef, sunset view, this new place should become popular someday"
