Since there is still limited chain hotel in this area, we chose to stay here due to quite nice review in Internet. Surprisingly, their room is clean and spacious with very affordable price. I booked in traveloka for only 200k nett (bfast included). The location is less than 2km with Lovina making the transfer effortless. Also they has spa that only cost me 100k for a very good massage (ask kak Risma, she has a good spa background as well as strong pressure).

The layout of this place is absolutely beautiful, with a  choice of indoor or outdoor seating in a beautiful garden setting.
We ordered pina colada cocktails, which were so creamy and tasty.
It was a lovely added bonus that we were given a bread basket and tapas selection to nibble on whilst we were waiting for our mains. This was free of charge, and I was very impressed with the watermelon steak!!!
For my main, I had a prawn and truffle risotto dish, which blew my mind!!! I absolutely loved everything about this fresh, tasty, and well prepared dining experience.
When we asked for the bill, which was actually a lot lower than I had expected, the staff came out with a special birthday desert for me, and they sang me a lovely birthday song.
There was no extra charge for this.
The staff here are truly beautiful souls who went above and beyond, and they really made the experience even better!!!
I am really looking forward to returning here!!!","Definitely somewhere to spend a special meal while in Lovina. The atmosphere is elegant while also being relaxed.  The wait staff keep a discrete eye to ensure you want for nothing. Food is top notch. Steaks, seafood and pasta, there is something for all tastes. With pick-up and drop off to your villa or hotel you can totally enjoy your evening without transport worries. Highly recommended.","Wow. We were 2 couples. The men choose the d√©gustation menu. Seven excellent dishes. With wine pairing. All wines good. Two of them really excellent. Absolute price maybe not be cheap, but you will not find better quality/price relation in the whole of Bali. The women only took a main dish. Perfect too. More than a recommendation I would like to say tnis place is a must!","Amazing place in Lovina!)

Design is very luxury and stylish, they don‚Äôt have close air conditioning space, but have open and semi open which is pretty chilly in the evening.

Stuff is very present and organized, even sometimes too much pleasant)

Restaurant serve nice small complimentary dishes while you are waiting for your order.

Very pleasant music and environment with wonderful paintings!
Also, we were lucky to meet the owner of restaurant, very friendly person!)

Food was a little bit small as usual in all French restaurants) But it was very tasty and served very nicely.

I would recommend ordering a double portion of Oysters as for one person only 6 of them are not enough, they are small inside but very gentle, so you would like to continue but it finishes sooner than expected!)","We had a wonderful dinner at 10th Table. The food and atmosphere were lovely but the shining point was the impeccable service by the wait staff. Thank you for a lovely evening 10th Table.

The host is super kind, sweet and very caring. ü•π We definitely recommend this accommodation for your stay in Lovina! Everything was perfectly fine and we felt extremely welcomed. Thank you so much üôèüèº","Very friendly owners. Great hosts. Definitely great value especially for the price. Dare I even say my favorite stay in Bali?!

I stayed for seven nights in the junior suite. It is spacious and romantic in my opinion. The pool is clean. If I'm not mistaken it is cleaned daily. They even have a garden where you can relax/arrange a picnic/or borrow a yoga mat to do yoga on your own.

The vibe of the place is casual/friendly. It didn't feel like I was staying at some strangers guesthouse. They really try to make the place a safe space for everyone and include guests in possible activities. Also when I told them what my interest are they were willing to brainstorm with me.

Another thing is that I felt like they treated all guest equally, all while respecting their personalities (some are loners, some are social butterflies). When planning trips the hosts help me bargain for a good price and dig in their list of thrust worthy people. I really felt taken care of.

This is still a guesthouse, so even though they are amazing don't expect a 5 star hotel resort....

They really made Lovina such an enjoyable place to be in. Hope to visit them again soon!","The couple who own this guest house are super kind and helpful. They speak English fluently so the communication is perfect. The room was very clean and comfortable. We even got free waterbottles/tea/coffee and if needed we could refill from a safe water reservoir.
The breakfast had many choices (also vegetarian) and we could arrange the time.
If needed they also know reliable taxi‚Äôs for a good price to other places in Bali.
The clean swimming pool and airconditioning  were very welcoming in this hot paradise!
Definitely would stay here again when we come back‚ù§Ô∏è
Terima Kasih!!","We had actually booked only three nights in Kaia Lovina Guesthouse, but then extended on the first evening to a week, because we felt so comfortable here. And we have not regretted it!
Since we had booked the Junior Suite, we had plenty of space in the room. The room was lovingly decorated and clean. In addition, we had a large terrace on which we could have breakfast. The pool in the guesthouse was also nice and clean and we often had it all to ourselves.
There was a breakfast every day, where you could choose from several options. This was kept simple but always freshly prepared and delicious.
But the best part of our stay was the hosts, a married couple. We had never met more warm and friendly owners in our time in Bali. Since they both speak very good English, communication went smoothly and we enjoyed having long and fun conversations with them. In addition, they were extremely helpful, as soon as you had a problem or a question, they immediately tried to help and to fulfill your wishes. So we could not only book excursions and trips but also a laundry service directly through the accommodation.
All in all, the Kaia Lovina Guesthouse offers a great price-performance ratio.  If I come to Bali again, I will definitely check into this guesthouse again!
So once again, thank you for a wonderful stay."

On a busy street there is a small bakery and cafe called Loaf Time.  With its minimalist and modern decoration, it is a paradise for those looking to enjoy delicious pastries, artisanal donuts and top quality coffee.

The heart of Loaf Time is its owner, Wahyu, a young entrepreneur with a kind nature and passion for excellence in his business.  His dedication and professionalism are evident in every detail, from the careful selection of ingredients to the impeccable presentation of his products.  We just placed our order and they gave us a donut each.

But behind every sweet creation, there is constant hard work.  Wahyu gets up early every morning to start baking, ensuring that each donut is perfectly glazed and each cake is a masterpiece of flavor and texture.

However, Loaf Time's success is not only due to the talent of its owner.  Liana and Rina, employees whose attention and kindness stand out, also play a crucial role.  Their smiles are always present and their willingness to help made each visit a memorable experience.
We hurried inside, looking for something quick to go.  However, seeing the variety of options and the cozy atmosphere of Loaf Time, we decided to stay and enjoy some quiet time in the place.

It's not just about baking cakes and making coffee, it's about creating a space where people can relax and enjoy the small joys in life.",Best & very patient service.
