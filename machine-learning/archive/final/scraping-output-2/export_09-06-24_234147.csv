Overall, its architecture is superb offering brilliant photos besides great food.","Nothing special especially that you have to pay 100.000 for entrance and then you can only buy more stuff there. Man made rice fields that you can see all over Bali, but without the soul üòä. It‚Äôs just to sell their coffee and products ‚Ä¶ the view is nice but nothing special.","Really beautiful place with intriguing pools and astounding architecture. I really love the ‚ÄúTape‚Äù menu here, it‚Äôs a fermented cassava topped with brown sugar and shredded coconut flakes. It has the original heavenly taste of Nusantara. I will definitely come again bringing along my families and friends.","This is our second time here. We been
Here 2 months ago and the food was perfect. We even go to the one on sunset road.  However today was a disappointment. The ayam Klungkung was unedible. Very hard. We even left it and no one asked if it was ok. Never go on fridays and weekends. They can‚Äôt handle.","From the moment I stepped into the Secret Garden Village, I was transported into a world where the beauty of Indonesian-Balinese heritage seamlessly blends with the tranquility of Bedugul‚Äôs landscape. As a coffee enthusiast, the art of coffee processing here was a treat for the senses. The rich aroma of freshly ground beans and the intricate process of brewing were a testament to the village‚Äôs dedication to coffee culture. But it‚Äôs not just about coffee; the natural homemade body care products are a revelation, crafted with care and tradition. Dining here was an adventure in itself. The menu offered exotic Indonesian flavors that were both authentic and innovative. Each dish was a celebration of local produce, presented with flair and finesse. And the view? Simply spectacular. Overlooking the green forest of Bedugul Botanical Garden and the serene Ulun Danu temple, it was the perfect backdrop to a memorable meal.

Secret Garden Village is not just a visit; it‚Äôs a journey through the heart of Bali‚Äôs cultural and natural beauty. It‚Äôs a place where every detail is curated to offer an immersive experience that stays with you long after you leave. Whether you‚Äôre a local or a traveler, this village is a must-visit destination that truly captures the essence of Bali."

Can drop by if you're on the way back to Denpasar from lovina/ somewhere near bedegul.","Delicious taste of the pork dish, especially the soup was great! Good portion, reasonable price, limited parking for cars and around 6 tables for dine-in.","The worse service ever experienced over my trip to Bali. I let my dad to went there first as I had stuff to care of. He has seated himself, the staff saw him, the owner saw him as well. But no one approached him, to ask for what he want to order. As if no one acknowledged him just cause he's an old man.
And when I confronted them, suddenly they realized they had done something wrong to their customers. And went to serve him the food, as I got there later on, the lawar was already went bad, smells horrid.
I got up and complained just to be ignored once again. We left after.  Furious. Would never ever recommend this place to someone, unless they change how they treat their customers right.","I happen to know this place because I did a quick search looking for a nice place to eat on the way back from Ulun Danu. And boy I was right, the nasi campur is so tasty and nice! Make sure you ask for extra kerupuk kulit though, its so nice I bought some more. They also have this clear soup to accompany the rice which is nice. And the food was at reasonable price also! Thank you Babi Genyol Men Darta üëçüèªüëçüèª","I like this place to eat. We can choose to eat at the stall or at home. If you choose to eat inside the house, you will be amazed to see the view of the house with a very thick Balinese architectural design. The view is very beautiful to be enjoyed while eating. The food is quite good. The special food of this food stall is ""Be Genyol"" which means pork fat which is very soft and tasty. Besides rice with ""Be Genyol"" you will also be served a bowl of pork broth (complete with very tender meat) seasoned with Balinese special spices. The sauce is rather spicy and fresh sour. It looks like tamarine was added in the chili sauce."

But, it has nice rice terrace view and nice contemporary architecture. The coffee tasting should be great experience since other coffee shop not offering this services. Better if they served it in hot, not plain coffee.","We just stopped on our way to Munduk as it was raining really strong. We wanted to stop for a coffee. They had been really nice with helping us with some tissue to dry (at the reception if Secret Garden) but then asked us to pay 100k IDR each. We said we don‚Äôt wanna visit the garden, just here for coffee. Then they reduced it to 100k IDR. But should I pay that id the coffee hopefully is not that expensive. Luckily they left us waiting until the rain stopped. But as long as they are having Jakartala customer paying for this, it will not change. Strange for a coffee place!",I am super disappointed how such a hi end establishment can treat you like garbage. First I came to an empty parking lot and was told to go park and the far corner. Makes no sense wouldn't they be happy that the first guess that arrives would park at the front it would be nice to welcome someone that way. Then I received a sticker on my shoulder that would number me. I don't know what the sticker is for. But I don't like the feeling of being labeled as a number. I don't know anyone that would like that. Next was this voucher I got which seems nice and was 25k off if you spend 100k. After I ordered some food and some coffee I was told that the food and the coffee bills are separate and cannot be combined. I wasn't actually really hungry I bought the food just so I can get to the 100K and use the coupon. So this was kind of a deceiving promotion. The staff were nice and pleasant but the whole experience what is pretty satisfying I would not come back here again. It was also very sad to see the animals in small cages stressed out.,"The place is integrated with The Secret Garden. It is designed for event venue, as it has theatre and dining area, perfect for celebrating birthday, anniversaries, outing lunch/dinner or just pre wedding photo shooting. They also has coffee museum, and sells varieties coffee beans and coffee-related merchandise.",A must to visit place in Bali for true coffee lovers. Great atmosphere to enjoy top quality coffee. Their staff members are knowledgeable and friendly; they would be happy to answer your coffee geek questions. This is my happy place in Bali.

The environment was nice and relax, but The fragrance from the restroom was too strong, mayb can recommend to use something natural instead of use the synthetic perfume.","For such premium price they group the regular customers in the same venue as group tours' buffet lunch: which means super noisy chatters, screaming and running children while we enjoy our food. Not very happy about it, was not a great experience.","Tasty Indonesian foods, very nice services by all of the staffs.

Their smoked duck (bebek asap), I forgot the exact name for the dish, is really good. Their crispy duck and fried rice are delicious.","Good food, fair price, nice architecture, and the most important thing is good service!",Best Restaurant by far!
