The mama chef is lovely and cooks so well!,"If you've never had goat before, this fried rice version is the most beautiful place to start. The ibu uses a wood burning contraption that brings all the flavors out. Goat will taste a bit like lamb, and to some, it is better than lamb. Really lovely enjoyed with some peanut sauce from the satay and some of her boiled vegetables of cassava leaf or young fern. This nasgor is truly authentic and probably the best I've ever had in all of Indonesia.",I think it might be the best sate kambing in Bali - always stop here for lunch on our road trip. Dont forget to ask mama cook you moringa soup from her garden! Aaaand her sambal is amazing!!,"Not the best. Not the worst.
but for a place advertising itself as a sate place its weird that all the satay are the least edible thing. Tongseng was amazing, so was the soup. Couldnt eat the sate though. Was undercooked and terrible sauce.",Great food and run by such a sweet lady. She always greets me warmly...
