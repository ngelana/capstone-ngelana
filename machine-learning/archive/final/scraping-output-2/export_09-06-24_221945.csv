Spa looked amazing but unfortunately we couldn‚Äôt make it :( staff is so helpful, they even helped us borrow cash for us to pay for the taxi when we arrived.  Their breakfast is so delicious üòã with such a variety of food.  The place is absolutely stunning. Waking up and watching the sunset is lovely & listening to waves crashing the shore is super relaxing. Even though hard to reach their service and the nature definitely makes up for it.","The experience I had here wasn't that great. I'm fine with remote hotels with difficult access, but at least it should be worth what I'm going to get (and the price I'm paying). It's true that I got a quite spacious room with a balcony, but there were some malfunctions in the bathroom. The jetshower was leaky and the water heater didn't turn on immediately (I even thought there was no water heater because the faucet had no sign).

But my biggest problem was the breakfast. During my stay at four to five-star hotels in Indonesia, this is the first time I have had breakfast with a very little variety.  It's very disappointing because breakfast is one of things I look forward to when staying at hotels.

The surrounding scenery is beautiful but the beach fence looks like something you'll see in harbor, it would be better if it's replaced with wood or something else.

The good points of this hotel were it was serene and the staff was nice.  If you bring your own vehicle, you can look for food at the nearest restaurant (but it's too far to walk).","The villas and bungalows themselves are nice, clean, and quite comfortable. But unfortunately, the restaurant as an indispensable part of high-level hospitality still leaves much to be desired. The dishes are expensive but not worth it. So, please, keep improving the dish's taste and the price policy. We‚Äôll be happy to return.","I could say that this is an exotic place to spend a holiday. Lots of things to indulge yourself. The traditional looks on the furniture and ornaments makes the place unique. With a view on the ocean, great service, and reasonable price, it is a recommended destination.",had the best time there! if you want to feel like you arrived at home - go there!‚ô•Ô∏è

The Balinese food was delicious, and the ladies were so lovely. We got the gado-gado, fried eggs, Nasi and Mie Goreng, piseng Goreng, a salad with the thousand island sauce, fried chicken, and fried vegetarian spring rolls. We relished everything. However, the piseng Goreng was quite dry and too plain. We absolutely loved the gado-gado with the peanut sauce.",Amazing warung with all the fine dishes you expect on Bali in a perfect quality. Also the service is very friendly. I will come back as soon as possible üôèüèªüòä,Lovely roadside restaurant with good food at fair price and sincere staff:),Traditional warung. Nice place and staf. Good food and price!,Really a great place to eat. By far not as expensive as at the villas which is sometimes more expensive than in Europe. Way better taste as well. Especially the spring rolls stand out. You have to try them. All dishes we had were really good.
