The atmosphere is cozy, quiet, and like living in nature because you can hear a lot of bird sounds. The place is very clean and outside the room is filled with many plants). For those who like to bathe in unity with nature (whose bathroom conditions are open) it is very suitable to come to this inn.

However, for customers who bring vehicles (especially cars) must ask in advance regarding the availability of parking space because it only fits 1 car. The road to this place is also suitable for 2 cars.","This is my first business trip abroad. I spent 15 days staying at Katang-Katang Guest House, which is an excellent and convenient place, giving me the feeling of a traditional Balinese house within a lovely village.

They not only provide accommodation services but are also very supportive and respond promptly to any advice you may need. I felt completely safe and peaceful while living there, making it easy to relax by myself or focus on working during my time there.

I will definitely stay there when I return to Bali in the future. I am 100% satisfied",Such a nice authentic guest house in Denpasar ! The place is clean and the host are welcoming and helpful!,"A wonderful place!
We lived here for almost 2 months, we really liked everything!
Very clean, good Wi-Fi, there is a kitchen, a dining area, a green garden and most importantly, very nice hosts!
If in more detail, then:
We were looking for a long-term place to live and work, and it turned out to be perfect!
The hosts were super kind and helpful, they bought a stove and installed another WiFi router!! Therefore, we had a full kitchen, refrigerator, toaster, microwave.
Always very clean, this is carefully monitored. Even the towels smell delicious!
For us, the location was convenient, equally remote from Denpasar and Ubud, there are shops, restaurants and everything you need nearby (5-10 minutes by bike).
The most memorable thing is that the hosts invited us to the ritual of opening a new room!
I highly recommend it!","Katang-Katang is actually very conveniently located as there's lots of things to do and good food around if you take a ride.

The owner is so helpful and his son Adi is very trustworthy and he's a travel guru who knows Bali very well so don't be afraid to ask him any questions.

Highly recommended."
