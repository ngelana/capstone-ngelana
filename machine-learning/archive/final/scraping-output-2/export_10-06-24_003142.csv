The most advisable thing is to go by motorcycle, in my case I requested the service with the Go app. The road is long and it is necessary that the driver be an expert in that geography, otherwise, for inexperienced people it can be dangerous. Once arrived you can choose what service you want, if you just want to take photos with your own clothes you pay nothing more than the entrance fee, otherwise you can rent the dress and the photography service. The photographers have the best will and will make sure the experience is fun and pleasant. It is advisable to rent the dress since they have the correct length to achieve the visual effect in the photo, which is not achieved with a regular dress. Unlike other places that offer photos in hammocks, this place is larger and has more settings than others.",Reserved tickets in advance. The check in process went smooth. Luckily it was quiet. The photographers did an ok job. Out of all the pictures I probably actually liked 5. So basically an expensive visit.,"The amount to pay is quite a lot but the pictures are stunning and the staff really know what they are doing, the angles and how to make you pose. It‚Äôs so exhausting in the hot sun after a while luckily there is a cafe to refresh. You can rent dresses but I would advise knowing when you come and wearing your own dress as the price to go in is already pretty steep.",Get dressed up and take some cool photos. Definitely wear something flowy and if you don't have anything you can rent outfits. We didn't care to rent them and just had our street clothes. There are no grabs so you will need to drive yourself or have a hired driver. Be prepared for 2+ hours for pictures and the buffet that is included in your ticket.,"For the young at heart. I hired a gown and a tiara for the swings and captured beautiful photos. The girls helped me with the gown. Our package included 3-4 varieties of swings. The guides at the centre are trained and precautions are taken for the customer swinging. I enjoyed the swings and had a fabulous time.

The only drawback is the high level steps. Walking with the gown on those steps is dangerous. You need 2 people with you for handling you and your stuff. Not to mention the heat n sweat.

Worth its while....üòé"

The view from the valley is breathtaking and provides a perfect backdrop for a photoshoot.  The swing was really fun. They assign a photographer for every couple/group. Our photographer was excellent. He took lovely pictures and was very accommodating. It also seemed like a more affordable option compared to other swings.,"The scenic vista offers ample opportunities to capture stunning photographs of Bali. The friendly staff is more than willing to assist in taking pictures at various locations. Customers have the chance to review each photo after each spot, and the staff will gladly retake any unsatisfactory shots. The pricing is significantly more affordable compared to other nearby swing locations, offering savings of up to 50% or more. I highly recommend this establishment.","The treatment of the staff was much more respectful than the other swings we went to. They charged 10 dollars for renting each women's dress, but photography, drinks, etc. were free. Someone was with you and took pictures and videos, gave ideas, and gave guidance and help. It was worth it.",Amazing place (especially the view) ! No wait plus super kind and friendly ! Much better than the one next door. Drinks also really good! My husband loveeeeed the swing and they were so kind to let him swing for more than 5 minutes. The photographer was so patient that we even tipped him 100k!,"Staff there are very friendly. If time and crowd permits you can go on the swing multiple times! You can even request to be swung very high up the swings and they will be more than happy to assist.

The staff will help you to take the photographs and they are good at it!

Apart from the swings, they also have other props/settings for you to take your photos.

You do have the option to rent a dress for better pictures though it is not compulsory. I personally got the tickets online (via platform Klook) before visiting the place, which made the transaction fast and seamless.

Do note there are a lot of steps leading down to the photo spots, definitely not wheelchair accessible!

There is a small cafe within just for a quick drink, but do not expect too much"

Its not customers fault if it is raining. Its our right to demand a complete refund when it is raining and for sure the swing are not safe at all. Do revise your stupid policy and have some empathy toward the tourists. The stafs were not friendly as well as they only do the job becuase of the money. Not recommended üëé,This place is well developed and view is good from this place. Had a great time and swing too. Good place for Instagram pics,"Good place,,  very kind  staffs.
