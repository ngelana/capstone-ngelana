They have a rooftop for it ! Garden with flowers and vegetables like lettuce and parsley and so and so, which they use in the kitchen. So you can be sure to get fresh vegetables from the garden. And they offer you a small salad first of all. I choose Bebek goreng or fried duck for me late breakfast at 10 am
The small detour is worth.","The best restaurant in Bedugul, the foods are delicious! you definitely should try the Rendang Kambing!
The welcome salad is the best!
You can pick your own vege for salad if you want, they also have various dishes on the menu. From Asian to Western's dishes.
The place is peaceful very close to nature. It's convenient with a great facility. Perfect place to spend with family or friends.
It can be a working place too. They have many spots with tables and building around the garden.
And all the ingredient for the dish are organic from the owner garden's and local farmers. By visiting this restaurants, it means we support local farmers.
I'll definitely will comeback again!",Very very nice place with delicious and fresh food and coffee. Unfortunately we found one mistake - Pisang goreng (looks like some kind of meat in breadceumbs instead of the classic dough:/ - last picture) that was a pitty becouse the classic one is the best. 5 stars becouse I cant go down just for the fried banana :) So of course I highly recommend this place !,Not the restaurant's fault however the flies make it impossible to enjoy the food here,"The rating of this place is overrated. Half of the menu is Finish.(out of). Sooooo many lalats(flies) , it's very difficult to enjoy. The pasta and tomato sauce we ordered was ultra greasy and later had a stomach ache. The Virgin mojito was just Schweppes with a mint leaf. The girls did try their best (I hope) to make the best service. The guy at the front was the kindest! Overall not great. Oh! The little salads they gave were good. That's all."
