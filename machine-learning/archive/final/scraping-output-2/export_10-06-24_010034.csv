The meat melts in your mouth while the skin has that perfect mix of crunch and softness.  Other places I've tried, like Pak Malen, Swarga, and Jero Kawan, can't quite compete. Plus, Slingsing's prices are fantastic, and they even offer delivery!",The Nasi Campur is great. The pork crackling is crispy. Their dish has strong taste of aromatic ginger (in Indonesia we call it kencur). The service is also good. They have a spacious car park across the street.,"The food is tasty. The parking area is spacious. The servants are helpful. There is only one main dish here, rice with mixed topping that consist of roasted pork, spicy pork (mild spicy for my tongue), and mixed vegetables. If you ask for the non spicy rice, you'll get rice with roasted pork only. So, just like the title, the protein option is only pork.
If you are hungry, you can ask for the separate rice and toppings. You also can get the mixed one for a cheaper price.
I would come to the restaurant again if I went to the area nearby the restaurant.","The best Babi Guling joint in Bali! The crispy bits are crisp and mouthwatering savoury. The juicy meat are tender and sweet. All round delicious!

Everyone is friendly and helpful, now they have a spacious parking area across the outlet.","One of the best warung babi guling in Bali. Get the Rp40.000 portion and you won't regret it. Juicy, savoury, filling and all you ever wanted from a babi guling. Truly addicting and will recommend it to everyone."

This causes hundreds of flies to breed in the still water and drains.. every day I kill so many flies.

In addition, the paint they use on the house does not seal the water out, 3 weeks I to raining season and the wall are all turning yellow and growing mold, no air circulation, the walls are actually leaking water when it rains and when it rains the paint actual gets wet again and comes off when you touch...

Very poor materials and construction, I recommend you spend more money and live somewhere safe and healthy.

Same story from all the neighbors I've talked too.. if you love humidity and mold problems this is the place to live!","All buildings done wrong. No insulation from the ground, thus walls absorb surface water..no breathable membrane on the roof (under the tiles). It's mayor issue in Bali. Also roof smaller than building. Water goes inside the walls.","We bought a house after seeing it for just 15 minutes. And believe me, you never would have gotten this house at this price. Pretty neat! ü§ôüèæ",Next home

The room has ac, tv, hot shower, comfy bad, clean towels which is great for the price. The cons: no drinking water, leaking pipe in the bathroom, not so clean bedding, and a very noisy surroundings as the hotel is located on a busy main road. The best thing was the view from the window which surprised us in the morning. And the stuff was lovely and accommodating which is the reason why I give so many stars.","Pros:
Cheap (¬£10 per night)
Great shower pressure (& hot!)
Mattress is comfortable
Outdoor seating
Drying rack
Pool looks clean (didn‚Äôt get in)
Bright

Cons:
Rooms smells of cigarettes
No cover on duvet so god knows how many people have slept under it (I have a sleeping bag liner so was fine for me)
Pillow is a little flat
Fairly loud since it‚Äôs on the main road but I‚Äôm a heavy sleeper so again, fine for me.
The curtains are thin so morning light shines through
The bathroom drain is under the sink so the entire bathroom floor gets flooded when having a shower. The door handle is also broken so had great difficulty getting out üòÖ
Also, weirdly they have a kitchen but is only for display?!

Overall, one of the better budget places I have stayed it. Really is fine using it as a base if you‚Äôre out all day. Tried to extend but it was fully booked.","The place are just fine, rooms aren‚Äôt very clean but I think with the budget we spend it‚Äôs equal.
There are small swimming pool and common space with desk and table which I kinda like it.

The location is far away from main road, and to get there from gilimanuk harbor we‚Äôve been directed to very small road.

It‚Äôs hard to find online driver to order food, so a bit pain to stay here if you depend on these services.","Clean, beautiful outside, designed without much brain, thus surprisingly empty inside. Reasons:
1) Large Room, tiny AC in faraway corridor that doesn‚Äôt reach the bed at all. Hot even in the night. Bad sleep.
2) It‚Äôs positioned like a speaker on main road. It‚Äôs so loud it‚Äôs like sleeping on the road. Horrible at 7 am! A little backward thinking could‚Äôve helped.
3) Great bed, Great service, mellow pillow. Designed for Chihuahuas.
4) The bathroom is strikingly colourful, but also the drainage system is on the other end of bath, thus wetting entire room. Design thinking.

The hotel is great to impress neighbours outside, but not the guests inside. They must rethink the room design.","The room is okay, the light in my toilet didn‚Äôt work, the shower is good, wifi not so good, the kitchen dosen‚Äôt work, the fridge is broken, the stove and the sink aswell, location is not too bad"

In my opinion, the taste of the food is certainly delicious, the sushi is top notch, although the price can be said to be not cheap, but that's okay.  The location is quite easy to find, it's just that there are very few seats available, maybe only fits around 6-7 adult.
