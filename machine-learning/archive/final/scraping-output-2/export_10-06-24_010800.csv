Nusa Penida, Kabupaten Klungkung, Bali 80771, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=16383305237493394901,OPERATIONAL,,resort_hotel,"resort_hotel, hotel, lodging",4.4,13,,"The worst experience of my life and I did many countries.
Honestly send lot of courage for the staff team because it’s really hard, they do their best, but they are only 2.

Where can I begin :
1 - location : the hotel is very far of the main road, you have to take a off road, where only 4x4 can pass.
Plus Google map give a bad location so we passed 1 hour to find the good road !!
Finally the staff need to came to the main road to show us the road.
You are not free to go out because you need 4x4 so someone needs to pick up you.

2 - the room : not really clean, our bed broke during the night…..
No hot water from the shower.

3 - the food : spring roll overcooked / french fries and nuggets from the fresh frozen / Mie Goreng (local speciality !!) from the micro wave (wt* ?)

4 - animals : you’ll say it’s in the jungle, right ! But there is a totek just under our bed, you can check the beautiful song of them on YouTube

To conclude, I think the boss have to think about de model of this hotel, it can’t work in this condition, we will ask a refund to booking.

Thanks to the guy from the staff who drop us to the port and good luck for the future.","honestly not worth it
It’s impossible to get to the location you will have to ride the bike through a jungle for a long time to find it, it’s quite dangerous and at night times nearly impossible to do.
The water boiler was broken hot water in the shower is not provided. The food is really gross and cheap. The staff is slow and you cannot count on them. The place is beautiful but with all the other circumstances you have to deal … not again

Better find a place that is actually accessible! And where people are actually helpful.","Very interesting cottages with bathroom outside.
Great pool, unfortunately the location is a bit problematic. No accessible driving surface, there is a heavy forest path leading to the lodge.
I would recommend this place to those wanting peace and quiet.","This place is perfect for honeymooners. No doubt the best place in nusa penida to stay. The open bathroom gives all the luxury feels.  The staff Tira and Arta are welcoming and very helpful in nature .
Would highly recommend this resort for the stay.","The room was very excellent and authentic and clean,very spacious and best one is outdoor shower and there is big tree makes nice flower completely peace,thank you Tira and Komang was nice cook and nice meal and free drop lovely"
