We arrived later in the afternoon, after doing activities throughout the day, and it was a great way to relax after a busy day.

Service was good, with towels, lockers and showers provided as part of entry. Many flies unfortunately but they do give you notice and help out if there is more than expected.

The baths were warm with a great view. Definitely go back for longer next time.","Was there in the evening, and luckily it was raining at the time.
The natural hot springs were just amazing and luckily it wasn‚Äôt so crowded at all.. literally had the infinity pool to ourselves for over 3 hours. Enjoyed the rain and a beautiful sunset too.
Was just an amazing experience
Will definitely come back.
They have amazing pools","Huge following on Instagram and a wonderful location however this place is incredibly outdated and rundown and is literally falling apart. It is incredibly dirty, the locker rooms, showers, toilets, the restaurants and the hot spring pools. The large slide is not operating. If good money was spent on bringing this place back to its former glory it would be special but it‚Äôs excessively tired, run down and depressing to be here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. not worth the money for the entry fee.","Unfortunately, we had a bad overall experience. The place as a whole is not well-maintained and dirty at some places. Even though they warned us about the flies in the entrance, it was a pandemic, and they were everywhere, especially around the restaurants. One could not sit and have a normal meal due to them.

Overall, the place felt cheap. The reason for giving two starts is because the staff was friendly and pleasant.","We went there to experience the hot spring at mount Batur. Unfortunately it was the flies growing season in May and the flies are inside the water and around your food and drinks :( the view is stunning and the hot spring is nice, but probably come in the non flies growing season, you will get better experience üòÇ one more suggestion is to bring your own extra towel as the hotel only provide one towel per ticket"

Swimwear was available outside for purchase in case you forgot to bring one.
There are 3-4 hot spring pools and some of them have jets of hot water that felt so relieving for the back. We easily spent over an hour relaxing in the pools and my entire family loved their time here. The pools also have wonderful views of the volcanic mountains.","I was skeptical and was not keen on going inside the hot spring because I wasn't sure of the Sulphur content.
However, it was very well facilitated with options of pools and intensity of hotness.  I'm glad I went and enjoyed it and experienced the overall muscles being smoothed over, effortlessly gratifying feeling","Really good experience and a variety of pools to choose from with a range of temperatures.  Lovely views of the mountains and lake.  Food available at reasonable prices in the restaurant but I'm sure I swallowed a few flies.  Overall, very worth a visit - 60k for Bali residents.  And cheaper than the place next door.","A very nice experience to swim in the warm waters coming from the springs.
With a good view of the lake to make you refreshed and enjoy.
They have a quite nice restaurant on site and lockers and dressing rooms","Not the place to go. We came here end March 24 and were quite disappointed.
The main pool by the lake was not working. They had a noisy pump running running mid day, which spoiled the entire experience. All the polls that had water and a kind of view were too warm to stay in for longer and there was no pool with cooler water.
All the stretchers were in the sun too except one corner. This corner was not maintained smelly and dirty. No umbrella anywhere.
Yet we paid the full price, in cash no card excepted and no ATM anywhere.
Overall it felt liked the Bali from 20 years ago except for the rip off prices of the Bali today.
Spend your time and money elswhere."

They cleaned our room right in front of us, because we arrived half an hour before check-in, the cleaning lady left an empty wine bottle and some trash in the grass in front of the room, she passed by it several times and she didn't care. we didn't even stay there for an hour","Good location and definitely worth the money. As it is cheap, you get what you pay for. BUT I think it's nicer than other places for the money. Breakfast is not bad either. They have a little shop there to get urgent things what you need. Facility is also accommodated with small outside pool which is a little bit heated, so that's cool.
Definitely recommend.","Stunning view for breakfast, I paid for breakfast included and they give you a selection to choose from it tasted great. The room was very spacious and had a hot shower. The mosquito net around the bed made me feel so cosy. The swimming pool is lovely and warm with an even more amazing view of the mountain.

Edy helped us organise a guide. The room was modern and clean, the garden is lovely and the hot pool was a great luxury.

Easy to walk to local Warungs and shops.","Beautiful boutique accommodation. Very cozy. We actually just asked Eddy, the owner,  if we could use the hot spring infinity pool, and it was 60k for a daily use. We were the only people there, so it was an awesome experience. The grounds are very curated and peaceful. It has gorgeous views over the lake & Mt Batur. If you're a solo traveler or a couple, I recommend coming here instead of going to the thermal centers nearby. Opposite the resort on the main road there's also a handy supermarket for drinks and snacks.","We booked this place on Airbnb for a night to come check out the Lake and mountain. This is the cleanest place we have stayed at in Bali. High ceilings, big bathroom, and comfortable bed. The garden area is currently getting remodeled for new rooms. Nice kitchen to cook at if you would like to purchase your own groceries . More local feeling than Uluwatu, Kuta, etc. not very much westernized food but local food restaurants close by, or try the restaurant on the property. Edy is a very genuine , caring, guy and we‚Äôre happy to be a guest here. Thank you for having us.","Booked The Lava Bali and contacted Edy who was really friendly and responsive. I was thrilled to know they had a hot spring pool. My husband and I stayed for 1 night and we used the pool at night. On the very wee hours itself, we embarked on the Mt Batur hike organised by their mountain guide. The mountain guide's name is Mangun and he was really professional. Highly recommend to book your hikes via The Lava Bali as they will prepare everything for you. The location of this accommodation was also near Mt Batur. It was our first time to Kintamani and we did not realise that there is no grab or gojek services around like how it worked in other parts of Bali. Edy helped us by fetching us back at a small fee from where we were as we were stranded. If there is any chance to return, i will come back to The Lava Bali again."

The villa has its own private pool with warm water from the hot spring. However there were so many flies because of rainy season, and the worst part is in the restaurant during breakfast. You can't enjoy anything because of the amount of flies.","My family and I booked a 2 night stay at Ayu Kintamani. It was our first time there and we were excited to swim in the hot spring pools. Our first impression was very good. The butler Komang was very nice and very helpful. We had a family villa that was two separate identical buildings with a pool and outdoor dining area with chairs and TV. The rooms were nice, but the bathrooms were semi outdoor bathrooms, so there were lots of dead bugs in the bath tub and we didn't bother to use them. The bathroom floor was slippery and my kids fell down after taking a shower. The other downside was we were overrun by black flies all around the outside dining area. We had to keep our doors to the villa closed at all times to keep the bugs out. The wood flooring around the pool and the pool chairs were in need of replacing.

The connection to Toya Devasya was very convenient! There are plenty of pools to enjoy including 2 with multiple water slides.
There are also multiple bars and restaurant areas. However again the downside is the you are completely overwhelmed by hundreds of black flies everywhere outside the pool. It is a constant issue whenever we ate at the bar or had the breakfast buffet. Can't keep them away with the candles the staff provides at all. There were no flies around the pool while we were swimming.
The menu for room service and the restaurants is the same. It is very large and the food was decent. However with room service or food at the restaurant the staff wraps everything with plastic wrap to bring it to your table or your room to keep the flies off it.

The view of the lake and mount Abang is amazing.
But at sunset and sunrise you can hear the very very loud sound of a certain beetle in the trees. Also we were in the family villa all the way in the back of the property and we found out that the owner has a house right next to that. We heard the owners dog barking late at night as we were going to bed. We called the front desk about the dog barking late at night but they didn't do anything about it since it's the owner.  Also disappointed to see him let his dog wander around the property as we saw the dogs poop on the pathway from the villa to the hot springs.

All in all it was a pleasant experience. The hot springs and water slides are great. The pool at our villa was also hot spring water, just not quite as hot as the large hot spring pools. The hundreds of black flies in all the areas that you eat was terrible and unavoidable. I would only eat in the villa and not outside at the table or at any of the bar/restaurants if I went there again.","This is my first time in Bali, and my partner decided to booked at The Ayu Kintamani. All I can say is everything was wonderful, from their fantastic decorations, their rooms are really superb and their service was incredible, the staffs was so friendly and easy to approach. Kudos to Mr. Komang who assisted us since we arrive at the hotel until our checked out. He is so kind and always smilling. Good job guys, keep up the good work. I would definitely come back in our next trip. üëèü´∞","Stayed for 2 nights from 27 July 2023 to 28 July 2023. Room is required some preventive maintenance, revarnish the cupboards, remove the scale from the water taps, repair the bathtub stopper, etc.

Service is mediocre for such as room rate. During the reservation through WhatsApp, It was agreed that allowed to not use extra bed however it was not communicated to the receptionist upon check in.
As in house guest, we were not allowed to use the pool towels & locker at Toya Devasya (Toya Devasya is the Ayu Kintamani Villa facility). It was so funny, this is the first experience that i encountered when stayed in the hotel/resort (has to pay to hotel/resort pool towel & locker facility). After we argued and the staff checked with Receptionist, they gave us the towels.

The butler was helpful however gave the difference information such as trunyan tour (he said 1,5 mil rupiahs whilst resort has promo 280,000 rupiahs per pax).

Towels were provided incomplete (no face towel & no hand towel) for expensive rate. Bathtowel has shown some wear & tear.

The worst part is no hot water for shower. Bathroom is a kind of outdoor bathroom. Kintamani temperature is always cold but something that does not make sense is no hot water, either you decide to no take shower or freezing while take shower.

Hope improvement can be done by management to make The Ayu Kintamani a memorable place to stay.","While like most places in Bali after having zero income, the resort is working to get back to fully functioning and operational with some aesthetic upgrades needed which is understandable when you actually see how HUGE the place is. However this is all overlooked by the friendliness of the staff and the comforts of the room and the deliciousness of the foods and drink! They went above and beyond to ensure we were looked after and happy even letting us have our free breakfast 1.5 hrs after it had ended. The view from the springs is amazing and just the place to relax with good seperation from the children's area but still in the main section. When we return to Bali will definitely stay again!

I cannot say enough good things about the staff at Sunrise Guesthouse.
The manager and the owner are some of the nicest people I've ever come across! There was no request they wouldn't fulfil.
The information guestbook was the most comprehensive I've come across.
Each morning fresh breakfast was delivered to our room.
The rooms are comfy and clean and have the most impressive water system I've come across, whether you want cold, warm or hot water for drinking, it's there!
The guesthouse is within 200m of the start of the trek point and very very close to the lake.
The local restaurants are ok and you need to be prepared for flies that are everywhere when you eat....this is to do with Kintimani and not the restaurants, and the only downside. This side of the lake seems less developed for tourists, but everyone is super friendly and there are local supermarkets, bars and restaurants nearby.
To reiterate, the staff and the service at Batur Guesthouse wouldn't be out of place in a 5 star hotel. Excellent!!!"

We got the grilled chicken and local fish as recommended by the owner. As you can see we dug in before I could even think to take a photo - it smelt so good. The owner (I think they were the owner) was so lovely and came to check on us halfway through to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Price wise it was amazing. 45k for the fish and 35k for the chicken. Definitely worth visiting,The food was really good  but if you are hungry the plates are a littlebit less.

Pool temperature is around 37-40 degrees. Currently there is two pools that are in use, third one which is the deepest will be ready in 2 weeks. We came around 5pm, it wasn‚Äôt so busy but after 7pm you will see more people joining. The owner is really friendly and nice, this place could be a gem among all the hot springs but behaviour of some people will put off tourists. I saw people smoking,spitting,eating food in the pool or even shaving!!! Owner should consider placing some rules and sings also toilets and changing room needs improvement.","A kind little hot spring, with 3 pools. Make sure you go in the morning, when it is still empty, and the sun is not burning yet. 50K is a good value for the price, we spend maybe an hour there.","Pool is very nice and Hot spring is worth it!! Unlike the expensive springs this one charges 50000 and if you want to spend in a budget this is the place.

Place is crowded during the evenings and beat time is to go during mornings before 9:00.

Owner is very friendly and speaks Good English.","Nice place!! I didn‚Äôt go to the hot spring but people there seem to enjoy it a lot, mostly local people. Food also nice!! And the price is just perfect. They only have nasi goreng and mie goreng and each was 15k, I love nasi goreng moreü•∞","Volcano Sari Hot Spring is easily one of the best hot springs around Kintamani. Not only is it incredibly affordable at only RP.50.000 per person, but it also comes with a towel, soap, shampoo, and water - everything you need to enjoy a relaxing soak in the hot springs.

The owner of Volcano Sari Hot Spring is truly lovely and friendly, making sure that every guest feels welcome and comfortable. The pool itself is clean and well-maintained, with clear and hot water that's perfect for easing sore muscles and relaxing after a long day of exploring.

One of the things I love most about Volcano Sari Hot Spring is how affordable it is. Despite the low cost, the hot spring still manages to provide an exceptional experience that rivals more expensive hot springs in the area. It's a great option for budget-conscious travelers who still want to enjoy the beauty and relaxation of Kintamani.

Overall, I would highly recommend Volcano Sari Hot Spring to anyone looking for a fantastic hot spring experience in Bali. It's affordable, clean, and well-maintained, with a friendly owner and a relaxing atmosphere that will leave you feeling rejuvenated and refreshed."

To think that this is a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù resort, and considering the journey that one must make, it‚Äôs not at all worth it. There are flies everywhere, the food looks and smells disgusting, and to make matters worse, the influx of crowd that comes in as it‚Äôs a halal restaurant, you wouldn‚Äôt want to eat or step into the hot spring. Avoid at all cost. Oh, and if you do get into the overrated hot springs which is nothing but a swimming pool with a pipe pouring in spring water with the force of a tap, for the love of god, don‚Äôt use their changing rooms.","Dirty toilet.
Public toilet&shower were not at a good maintainance,broken parts&no privacy while shower.
Water off 04 AM-07 AM.
We came 2 adults&1 kid,they charge for 3 adults (for mineral water&towel) but they didn't gave any additional of it.
Bonfire dealing as per website incl corn+steam peanuts+drinks,in fact only bonfire.
Service&management too bad,we couldn't sleep due to neighbour snoring&we ask for changing room as other side were empty until 11.30 PM,but FO didn't gave it with many excuses.
Lack of safety in waterslide area.
Waterpark open for public,they allow people to down the water without swimsuit.
B'fast incl rice,noodle,chicken,egg,crackers,sambal,pickle,coffee&tea.
Ikan mujair nyat-nyat was so so,better buy at Depot Ibu Dewi Asih 300m away in the left side of the hotel.","Not a bad place. Definitely not a wellness retreat! The idea is good. But 5am sound checks that go for two hours destroy any serenity the place may have had.
When checking out staff tried to deny us our money from the cashless card system they have. Front desk staff were quite rude and it took 45 mins to sort out.",The worst experience ever!!!! Never come here,"Relaxing your mind and body, this place offering us such a best mountain view and lake. The combination between the cold weather and warm water of the pool"

I recommended! üôåüôå I never seen that good photos before, perfect","We were looking for a place to see Danau Batur and Rejeng Bali Camp and Restaurant did not disappoint. The clientele was great, beer was crisp, views were amazing, and the service was top notch. JB, the owner, was our server for the night & was nothing but accommodating. He chatted with us, teaching us about the local village & made us feel very welcome. His restaurant is located in a nice off the beaten path location, quiet & beautiful. Highly recommend to anyone traveling through the area!!","The guide was nice and friendly. We were unpleasantly surprised though by the people who work at the cemetery. They kept haggling us for donations and more money, our guide wasn't allowed to come in with us and the mandatory local guide who accompanied us didn't speak English and kept rushing us without explanation while asking for more money."
