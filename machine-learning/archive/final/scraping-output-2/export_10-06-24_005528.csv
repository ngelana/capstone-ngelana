It was like sonethjng from a movie the drive up to this place through the village and dark winding roads. Amazing what you can find from Google! We seek out genuine authentic Neapolitan pizza wherever we travel and we're thrilled to find this place.  The owners were lovely people and we got the story, after working abroad in an Italian they came here and built their own pizza oven!! Cute seating out on the balcony (inside might use a bit more mood lighting, but the local clientele may not care for that detail). Bring your mosquito repellent though! Pizza was made to order as partner has special dietary needs (no onion and garlic, which authentic Margherita would not have anyway but some places don't realise this). The fries were great and pizza fabulous, just look at that crust! My only thing was the mushroom was rubbery but I don't know what Bali mushroom are like and so this may be normal here.
I love love loved the lime drink! I wasn't expecting it to be so nice but it was just delicious and what you need in the heat.
And for me, a decent toilet, I'm always on the search for in these hot countries lol","Came to try one pizza for 2 and ended up having 3!

Pak Gusti and Ibu Yoshi at Pizza Napoli will surprise you with great hospitality and delicious pizza.

This place is right in the middle of a village and totally worth it if you are around the area.

Will definitely come backüíú","Great napoli style pizza, Gusti the owner was super friendly and helpful. I had two pizza's, the diavola to start then couldn't help myself and got another the teriyaki chicken  the dough was authentic Italian style and they both had great taste. Was very happy and would highly recommend if your after a real pizza . And of course a large Bintang.","Great pizza and great owner. Simple and fresh ingredients, the owner makes everything by himself, including kneading the dough by hand. Very authentic and respectful of Italian style pizza.","The pizza looked promising the reviews were decent it seemed open and they did mention opening hours are after 4 pm and we go there around 6.30pm and tried to ring the owner to see whats up and no response.

Just some helpful advice to visitors and the business owner : please inform your customers within you IG page & google maps when you are randomly closed and to visitors please make sure you check if they are open because the premises is located a bit off the main road and is a waste of time if you are hungry and expecting to have a nice dinner with two other people. Sorry but it‚Äôs not professional to do that, will not give another shot there due to random working hours. All the best üôèüèª"
