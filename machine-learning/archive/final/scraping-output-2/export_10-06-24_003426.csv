The route to the resort is mesmerizing with an amazing view of the paddy fields...
If travelling to Bali.. this resort should be a part of the itinerary",This is one of the best place we visited in Bali trip. The resort is five star with all five star amenities and you can feel the cool and calmness of nature here unlike kuta. The place is little isolated and need transport to go anywhere. The food is good but lacks Indian cuisine options but you can order it via grab food delivery app as recommended by reception person.,Best place to experience calm jungle atmosphere surrounded by green vegetation!

We also got the floating boat breakfast which we both enjoyed üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Went there for our Honeymoon, and to summarise the experience, it was just beautiful.

And thanks and shout out to management for giving us both a memorable honeymoon","The whole hotel is a dream made happen. You stay in the jungle with an infinity pool.

We ordered the lamb (best I‚Äôve ever had), beef carpaccio, salmon. For sides, we got the truffle mash, French fries, carrots, mushrooms.  Bigger portions than we expected.

They sent us home with petit-fours that were delectable.

You can enjoy the views of the rice fields as you dine.  Then I suggest to stop at the little boutique at the restaurant downstairs, we got some lovely jewelry."

I have been coming here the last 3 times I visited Ubud!","I came here for the day because I had to get access to good wifi for work, and it was super nice!
The view is amazing, the place is beautiful, I didn't have time to try the food or the drinks but for the overall ambiance, I was not disappointed!

The wifi worked without any interruption for the whole day.

Just two minor things, the day I came, there was a promotion that could have had me the day for free if I arrived before 10am and I didn't know about that, that's a shame that there is not more communication about those promos on the website (or maybe I'm completely blind and just didn't pay attention - in that case, my bad)

Second thing, if you go upstairs for the AC room, do keep in mind that the bamboo structure moves / wobbles a lot when people move around. For me, it was not so annoying, but if you do precision / creative work, or if that kind of stuff annoys you, you'll have to stay in the ""outdoor"" area üòâ","In the middle of the rice terraces. An amazing view when working. The upstairs area has air-conditioning and it's very quiet. It was a very productive day when I worked at Beluna. Will definitely come back again! üíª

The coffee smoothie was also delicious, a bit too much sauce on the chicken salad ü•ó but it was delicious.","Location can only be reached by motorcycle. However, once you reach the location, the view is nice. Quiet for working as this place provides a co-working space. Food & drink is fine, reasonably priced and good service.",I stayed in the area for 3 weeks and visited Beluna quite frequently. It‚Äôs a great place to get work done or just chill and enjoy the the surrounding rice paddies. The food was also very delicious. Highly recommend the dragon bowl and the peanut toast crunch.

After talking to some other guests it seems like this is a problem for downstairs 2 rooms only.
Try to book the Queen rooms or upstairs double room.

2 stars for the friendly staff and scooter service to the main road and good restaurant on site.

Be aware of mosquitoes as near by the fields. The pool just front of the room is a delight. I highly recommended. Plus the smoothies bowl is just wooow‚Ä¶","I both stayed and dined at this place several times and I would gladly come back again. It's a place where you truly feel relaxed, and it immediately feels like home from the very beginning. The food is delicious and feels natural. The rooms are spacious and overlook the rice fields, and you can often see fireflies as well. Taking a morning walk along the rice fields is pure joy and makes getting up in the morning a pleasure. You may need to ride a scooter or take a somewhat long walk to reach the hotel, but it wasn't a problem for me.

Would recommend going,"Incredible setting in the rice fields which is nicely removed from the bustling tourists in Ubud. Great deal, considering the service, setting and rooms.

The very friendly hotel staff will send mopeds into town to grab you & your luggage, but I really loved the walks in the fields. It was beautiful to see it at different times of days and to get the flow of the local community.

As a warning, it is loud with nature noises so takes a day or two to settle in. The rooms are in need of some cosmetic updates, but nothing that upset my stay in any way.

I look forward to returning next time I am in Ubud!","This place is a hidden gem. The atmosphere with the sound of roosters and nature, the beautiful lush rice fields, the friendly staff, and spacious rooms with outdoor showers/baths. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived here and ended up staying longer than scheduled because we enjoyed the relaxing, peaceful environment and friendly staff. If we are ever in Ubud again I will most likely come here. Thanks for everything üôè",Perfect location in Ubud! We stayed at these beautiful villas for 3 glorious nights with our family (kids 9 and 5). We had the 2 bedroom Villa with our own pool. Loved every minute. Surprised by some of the scathing reviews to be honest. The Villa was clean and today mildly run down (very very mild) and the vista from our room was magic. There are roosters but this is a welcome experience in my viewüòÉ! The Villa staff were very helpful arranging transport into town via scooter which the kids loved! This is a free service 24/7 for guests! The breakfast is lovely also but if you aren‚Äôt keen on that a 2 mins scoot into main centre and you have a multitude of options! Very central location also so we were happy to be in the bustle one minute and serenity the next. Thank you to the wonderful team at Masia we will be back!!!!

The place is beautiful, in the middle of the rice fields, it feels like you are not in Ubud anymore.
The place is only accessible by scooter, but you are 20 min from Ubud centre walking, and the walk is lovely, at night you can spot fireflies!
If you don't want to walk the staff offer a drop off and pick up service for free, from 7am to 11pm.
The staff is lovely, they do their best to help. We had a small issue with our room and it was fixed as soon as they were aware of it.
Thanks a lot for offering such a good service in a such beautiful place.

Nestled in a picturesque rice field area, the hotel is close to downtown Ubud but delightfully remote, with access limited to motorbikes and foot traffic.

The hotel's serene ambiance was occasionally punctuated by the presence of adorable ducks, adding a touch of charm rather than disturbance. The rooms were spacious and cleaned daily, ensuring a comfortable stay. One of the highlights was the outdoor shower in the bathroom, which provided a unique and refreshing experience, though it did attract some friendly lizards.

The staff were incredibly friendly and always eager to assist with any issues, making the stay even more pleasant. For those wanting to explore the city, it was an easy walk to downtown Ubud, but for the less energetic, a convenient moto shuttle was available.

The generous-sized pool was a perfect addition to the serene setting, offering a relaxing spot to unwind. Overall, this hotel is a gem for anyone seeking a peaceful retreat with easy access to the vibrant heart of Ubud.","Had a wonderful stay at the Samara Villas! They were very helpful and accommodating leading up to, during, and after our stay with all of our questions and requests. Could not have asked for a better place to stay. The rooms were very clean and had a great view of some rice fields. Make sure to keep an eye out in the mornings for the ducks to march by!
Breakfast here was very good and very well priced. We did not eat any dinners here, unfortunately.
They went above and beyond for us during our stay, helping make the trip stress free at every turn.
As a side note, cars are not allowed down the street, but the villa will gladly transport you and/or your luggage to/from the main road with their motor bikes
Thank you Samara for everything and hope to be back soon!","Absolute best experience staying at the Samara Villas & Restaurant. The property is on an active rice field where you can watch farmers tend to the field. We had breakfast at the restaurant on most days, which overlooks the rice field. The food was tasty and a great way to start off the day. The rooms were very clean and comfortable and provided all toiletries needed (even insect repellent!). The outdoor showers added a memorable touch. The service was top notch accommodating all of my requests timely and without hassle. Rusma deserves a special should out for her service. She scootered down to hail us a taxi because she knew we were running late to our special birthday dinner at Mozaic. I‚Äôll forever remember her kindness. If you are ever in Ubud, I highly recommend staying at the Samara villas and restaurant.","Wow, is how I would describe my whole experience from start to finish at the hotel. I stayed in 3 parts of Bali during my visit and this hotel was the best. I dont like super busy places and this hotel is just outside of the busy part of ubud so you have peace and quiet. The accomodating staff offer a transfer to the city centre which is amazing. From beginning of my stay to the end the staff made me feel welcome and nothing seemed to be a problem for them. True hospitality. If and when I visit Bali again I will definately stay again! Thank you too all the staff for a wonderful 3 day stay.",Our family of 4 loved our stay for 4 nights. It was so beautiful to be close to centre of Ubud but have zero noise from traffic since we‚Äôre at the edge of rice fields and accessible only by scooter. The distance to Ubud centre is 1km easy walking or by scooter with staff. The handling of the luggage could be logistically hard if you travel with large suitcases so warn the staff so they have a chance to provide the great service/help we received during the whole of our stay.

Air conditioning, ceiling fan and hot water - what more can you ask for? My favourite part were the scooter rides to the main road when I was leaving in the morning. They also pick you up if you would like. So much fun and I felt safe with their driving.

Only thing I didn‚Äôt like was that you could hear the people in the room next to me.","Stayed in Bali in several places, this one was the best. Tidy and well taken care of. The ladies cleaned the room every day, adjusting the time when I was away.
The staff is actually fabulous! Always smiling, welcoming, trying to fulfill every request. Responding in a chat within a few minutes. Couldn‚Äôt be better!
Lots of facilities, pool with clear water to swim. Free breakfasts provided from 7:30 to 11am.
Rice fields view (of course!) It‚Äôs a perfect place if you want to be close to the nature. A bit secluded from the city center. They offer free bike rides anytime to the main road though, so it wasn‚Äôt a big problem.","What a great stay did we have! The people are so friendly and so sweet with our daughter of 2 years old. We had the small room but it was great for us three, Juna's little tent could fit next to our bed. There was a free watertank and fruits in the room. And because no car can come to the hotel because of the small path they come and pick you up and drop you off and the beginning of the mean road. They're really quick. And the location is beautifull between the rice fields. So tranquil. We had a view over de ricefields aswell. It's a great place to stay. Especially with the sweet people who work there.

Scooter rides into the middle of Ubud when needed were a massive highlight especially for my 13 year old. The staff were the loveliest. We loved our stay here so so much","I stayed at this location 4 nights in Ubud I can‚Äôt say enough about this place if I could give them 10 stars I would.
It is a hidden gem and off the beaten path. If you would like to be on the Main Street with noise and tons of people this is not the place for you.
You can only access it by motorbike but the staff offers 24/7 pick up and drop off from the Main Street. I called at 11pm in the rain and they answered and picked me up within 5 minutes. I apologized for waking the staff and his reply was no problem if you want to go back out tonight give me a call. I was amazed that he would come in the rain no matter what to pick me up at any time.
That is not the only thing. I left my phone in the taxi when I arrived realized it upon check in and they contacted the driver and went and retrieved my phone for me. I was a sitting duck with no phone I cannot thank them enough.
They asked what I would like for breakfast every morning and what time I would like my room cleaned everyday. They would not go in my room unless I responded. I had no worries about anything being taken.
I will return to this place again and again.
If you like taking walks by the rice fields quite relaxation on your stay with no worries this is the place. Peace and meditation but not to far from all the great eating locations and shops stay here.
Thank You so much Solo Villas & Retreat I will be back."

You cannot choose better location in Ubud. The surrounding is so beautiful and peaceful. The morning view at rice fields and mountains is unbelievable. The rooms are absolutely clean, very good equipped with very nice terrace. Highly recommend when you want to spent few days in paradise.","Juwuk Manis really deserves more reviews, since it is a beautiful,  comfortable and well managed Hotel.
It lies in the middle of Juwuk Manis rice fields. There lies its unique charm and its only ""disadvantage"" if it ever had one. Since it is a bit secluded it will offer you really peaceful nights (aside from junglelike sounds) and a lovely sensation when you wake up. The rooms are very nice, ours had its own pond, and it was overall quite comfortable and charming. The pool is also very nice when it gets hot and humid, and the place is overall extremely beautiful.
To move around you can either either perform a long walk through the fields and the market, or you may ask the personnel to carry you back and forth to the center of Ubud via motorbike which they will do at any time of the day or night without hesitation -I cannot stress enough how good a service they provided in that sense- or you might rent your own bike and problem solved. In any case, whatever option you choose, this distance factor should not deter you, it is really worth it and you get quite a matchless deal concerning quality/price relationship.
If you also have breakfast included, you can choose everyday one of six combos which come with a drink. If you stay long enough you will get tired of these, but tbh is not something to complain about either.
Do enjoy Juwuk Manis and its unique beauty.","Beautiful and peaceful place in nature. Although the hotel is older, still beautifully maintained, in a quiet area (rice fields).

We stayed here for 2 weeks enjoying every single detail beautifully put together by the charming manager of the estate. In fact, his presence together with his one of a kind sense of humor really made our stay! The suites are amazing and made us not wanting to leave the property. We got the chance to try The Lotus Suite with its romantic garden and The Tree House with a jungle bathroom. Both outstanding! A great breakfast is also included and was enjoyed every morning. Hope to come back again soon‚Ä¶","The Rice Joglo is the best place to relax and renew yourself out of the big city. We lived there with my friends for 1 month and liked it so much! Stuff is very caring and polite. Special big thanks to Sonu, who made our staying unforgettable! Every villa is so different and unique, the atmosphere is like everything was made with love. I am sure you will have amazing time in Rice Joglo. No doubt!!","This place exceeded all our expectations: the room details, the garden, the staff, the position in between the ricefields and the forest. Everything was just a dream. Moreover, we organized our wedding in here. We could not be happier for the choice of the location for our special day. Everything was just beyond perfect!Thank you!","This is my new favourite place in Bali. I stayed for a week, but it only took an hour or so to forget about everything and relax into nature here. It‚Äôs a 20 minute walk (or quick scooter ride) from central Ubud, but the path down is a lovely walk through the rice fields, and is dotted with yoga studios, cafes, shops and spas. I travelled solo, and the area felt very safe the whole time.

The property itself is a dream. I ended each night sitting in the outdoor bathtub, underneath the moon, overlooking fireflies light up the rice fields - surreal. And woke to the sound of their rooster, rather than my usual phone alarm. Wayan‚Äôs breakfast each morning, which is included, was delicious. A lot of the time I ate lunch and dinner here too, because the food was just so damn good, no matter what I ordered. Special mention to chef Gede, who I even did a cooking class with which was fabulous.

What really made my stay though, was the wonderful Sonu. He made himself available to me with whatever I needed, provided recommendations when I asked, and is a wonderful storyteller. Just such a beautiful soul. I already can‚Äôt wait to stay again. If you‚Äôre looking to slow down and be in nature, 11/10 would recommend.",We had refreshments in a lovely welcoming atmosphere after a long walk through the rice fields and jungle 'gardens'. It was a welcome heaven before resuming our walk.

They make the check-in process hassle free and quick.
The room is well maintained, clean, and most of the amenities are available including the safe.
Highly recommended if you‚Äôre looking for a place to stay away from hustle and bustle.","If you are looking for tranquility, this is the right place. The view of the rice fields right in front of your eyes is like a painting, large rooms with balconies for relaxing. Swimming pool and all the facilities you need are available here. And what impressed me the most was that Mr Kidem and his wife always made sure all guests were comfortable. They generously provided breakfast, lunch and dinner during Nyepi and took me to the next accommodation which was 2 hours away, truly the nicest couple! Fried noodles are my favorite breakfast! thank you for the beautiful place.","We just spent 2 wonderful nights at Kidem‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs one of the best kept secrets in Ubud, and we have been coming here for a long time. Set in the rice fields, this secluded and private haven is perfect to get away from it all. The location on Sari Organic walk makes it the perfect space to relax. The bungalows are made from washed teak, and the main room is about 30m2, with a huge bathroom area. Half of our bungalow was windows, with huge curtains for privacy.  Plenty of cupboard space too. Has a fridge. Kidem (the owner and his wife) are truly wonderful souls, and are some of the nicest people you will ever meet. Staff are attentive, industrious and will always make sure you are looked after, from extra coffee to preparing a fantastic breakfast - which will prepare you for the day ahead. We were looked after by Kedek, he was amazing and so were the other female staff . A  little swimming pool is all you need for a quick dip too. It‚Äôs a couple of KM from the main Ubud Palace, but the path to Kidem is lined with lovely Warungs, with authentic and affordable Balinese cuisine. Pomegranate is a cool little spot for great food and the best view of the rice terraces.  We will be going back to Kidem for sure. It‚Äôs a piece of privacy we all need, and the perfect place to ponder your own life - and what‚Äôs next.","I could write multiple pages on why this place is amazing. If you are trying to look for a place to stay in Ubud, this is 100% the place you should pick. The owner Kidem, his wife Wayan and the rest of the staff made our first experience in Bali absolutely amazing.

Kidem and a member of his staff waited up for us until 2am when we landed as our flight was delayed, they helped us with our baggage and drove on in scooters through the rice fields past the amazing sounds and beautiful fire flies to our accommodation, we hadn‚Äôt eaten in a while and Kidem very kindly made us some banana juice at 2:30am so that we wouldn‚Äôt go to bed hungry!

It‚Äôs safe to say waking up in our Villa to see the lush green jungle like forest and hearing the running water from the rice fields made us feel like we were in a fictional novel. This, accompanied by the friendly staff always checking in on us and Kidem, his wife Wayan always offering to help with lifts to the main road or the bookings of things to see around Ubud made this stay one our the best holidays we have been on.

To summarize -

10/10 service
10/10 location
Breakfast 10/10
Would we come back ? 100%","Lovely place between rise terraces and jungle, stayed here for two nights and love it very much. The olace has some distance from the main road you need to take a motorbike and have driver skills to go trough narrow small street between rise fields."

Or, you can just spend your time amongst the rice fields where there are cute cafes and restaurants and yoga shalas dotted along the path. The room was lovely, the bath was heavenly, and the people are so nice and friendly. Such a peaceful and relaxing stay, and amazing value for money!","We had the pleasure of staying in the villa. We love the next things in the place:
- Very friendly and helpful staff (we had some problems during our stay and they helped us)
- Beautiful place (rice terraces, tropical flowers, fruits on the trees, well-groomed lawn)
- Very delicious breakfast (banana pancakes, a mix of fruits and mango juice must have to try)","Super nice location, good breakfast and nice service! The walk (you can also grab a moto taxi) is super nice. I have been 3 times in Ubud and this is for sure on my top 2 list!","We have been so lucky to stay in Cahaya villa's of and on for over a month. So, we have been in almost all the rooms :-) and I can tell you they are all great, with fabolulous views over the ricefields. There are two new rooms with an amazing bathroom wit bathtub with a view of the ricefields, highly recomdended. But what makes the place feel like home is the owners and staff who are extremely friendly and serve the most wonderful fruitplatter for breakfast we have seen in 9 months of travelling.","Amazing location in the middle of rice fields, close to the Ubud center but just far enough so you don't hear all the city noise.

Can you imagine a hotel worker telling you in a strange way, ‚ÄúWhy did you come to this hotel and going to another hotel?‚Äù This is what happened to me! It was a very strange thing. The car couldn't get inside so he came to pick me up but I didn't want to ride with a man. So I politely asked not to ride with him. But he suddenly became angry and asked me to go to another hotel. I told him, ‚ÄúYour behavior is impolite.‚Äù So he shouted at me in the street and said, ‚ÄúI am impolite.‚Äù It was as if he was trying to attack me, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about you.‚Äù!!

He was an old man. If the hotel keep him working I‚Äôm really concerned about safety!esp for Female solo traveler please be careful!","Amazing location: 5 mins away by scooter to the center. Despite being so close to center, it is very quite and peaceful in the villa, you are surrounded by nature and beautiful animal sounds in the background.

After a tiring day of sightseeing and being surrounded by noisy Ubud traffic, I always looked forward to getting back to the peaceful villa, taking a swim in the pool and relax while drinking tea :)

The rooms are modest. Simple accommodation: comfortable bed, bedside table, drawer, AC, kettle, toilet with sink and shower. I had all I needed. Also, in front of my villa I had a table outdoors and it was a great place to drink my tea while reading or journaling and enjoying the beautiful nature around.

I booked for 3 nights but ended up staying 6 . I think GREAT price for what you get!! I had delicious breakfast included and the owner didn‚Äôt charge for scooter rides to the center.

When I needed to go somewhere further than the center, the staff was happy to drive me for additional charge (as they provide free rides to the center) , their prices were still better than Gojek/Grab :)

The highlight of my stay there was the owner and the staff! Such lovely people! The owner was very very kind and helpful, he suggested me many local places I could visit. Thanks to him, I got a more authentic insight of the city which I am greatly thankful for!!!

I am very happy with my stay at Taman Bintang Villa!‚ò∫Ô∏è I definitely recommend!","Terrible experience.
We booked 4 nights and only stayed one. Got a refund the next day and run away.
We got a room made of wood with lots of cracks in between. All painted in black so you couldn't really tell how dirty it was until seeing the bathtub and then you realise how dirty it actually is. We didn't even use the shower because it was disgusting.
The room was full of bugs, so we walked to buy a bug spray.
In the middle of the night hubby was woken up by a rat on his bedside table.
We can deal with insects but sleeping with rats not cool. On top of that, a couple of days later bed bugs bite appeared all over my body. I am most certain it came from this villa because the place we went after was a 4 star hotel very luxurious. It was our only option for a last minute booking after running away from this villa.
I would absolutely not recommend this place given that there are so many options around.","We have 4 nights stay and this is our experience

The Owner and staff of the villa are very friendly and helpful, the room is clean as well as the bathroom.
they have swimming pool also which is a good feature, a dining area, and a little bungalow near the pool if you wanted to do meditation or just enjoy the ricefield

Is located a bit far from the mainstreet, but they have free scooter shuttle to the mainstreet, for you who like walk a lot this place is also good!

Breakfast is good but is quiet small portion to start a day, but hey the taste is always be a mainthing!

Overall highly recommend for your stay in Ubud!"

Also the garden is teeming with flowers, plants and bumblebees. Great view and ambience, just make sure you use/bring mosquito repellent.","Very peaceful atmosphere overlooking rice paddies. Friendly and kind staff. but the most average breakfast I have had while in Ubud. Small portions and overpriced for what you get.

We had omelettes and I ordered extra feta (landing up with a piece of feta as big as my fingernail).","Such a great place, the best serene atmosphere, you feel instantly relaxed when you walk in. The food menu is very generous, everything sounds delicious so it‚Äôs hard to pick! I went with an iced coconut coffee and a tempeh burger and was very satisfied.
A must visit","I love this place! Had nice and tasty breakfast: veggie pizza, veggie omellete (cooked with coconut oil), rosella cooler, and crushed watermelon. This vegetarian cafe offers selection of nice vegetarian and vegan foods, with smoothie bar & vegan gelato menu

The atmosphere is so serene, surrounded by green rice field at the heart of Ubud, Bali.

Super friendly staff and very nice accomodations. Very close to the major shopping center/art markets in Ubud. Cool motor bike transport to and from the hotel. Amazing food. The dinner menu is expensive but we splurged and ordered it one night and the food was simply amazing. The hotel is surrounded by beautiful rice fields and you will see many locals going about their business. The staff made a beautiful flower arrangement and left it on the floor at our hotel. When we left they presented us with nice little trays as gifts. The staff also remembered us by our first names. I would definitely recommend this place.,"My partner and I stayed at Luxe Villas in July 2023 while traveling to Bali for our anniversary. We were picked up by motorbikes on arrival and driven to the hotel which was surprising but so fun! We felt extremely safe with the staff driving the motorbikes for us to and from the village whenever we requested- we used this service quite often! Upon arrival, our room was decorated with a beautiful floral arrangement for our anniversary, and it seemed they thought of every detail and accommodation- from local snacks and treats in the room, to impeccably clean amenities. The room was spacious and the upper private deck attached to our room was breathtaking. It overlooked the rice fields and we spent every night up there watching the sunset and having drinks. I wish I had pictures to include from the actual room and view, but truly we were too caught up in the beauty and moment to take many photos. We also thought the restaurant was incredible. We dined there twice- once on our first night, and once as a special anniversary dinner where the menu was customized with our names and featured 7 courses specially curated from all parts of Bali. We paired it with the cocktail tasting which was so well-thought out and wonderful- definitely left feeling tipsy though! Our leftovers were brought to our room with sincere care, and the hotel owner came to talk to us halfway through our meal and make sure everything about our stay was perfect- it was! During our stay, the staff also helped us set up activities, including the 4am hike to Mt. Batur, in-room massages (which were FANTASTIC), and local shops, hikes, and sightseeing. On the day we left, we left before breakfast (which was also incredible!) opened, and they even packed us to-go meals for our travels. I cannot say enough about how wonderful our stay at Luxe Villas was. Being from California, it was a long way from home for us, but I sincerely hope we can return again before long. If you're looking for accommodation that goes above and beyond in Ubud, stay at Luxe Villas!","Let me start off by saying you can never go wrong with the steak eggs Benedict for breakfast. My family and I came here in September of 2023 for a birthday celebration, and everything exceeded our expectations. The only surprise (which was my fault for not telling everyone) was that we had to ride scooters from the main road to the resort. We arrived at 1-2am and it was raining, so that was a unique experience. Regardless, our room was ready, our welcome drink was there, and the staff very accommodating. Everyone, including the owner of the resort, will treat you like family and make you feel at home. I plan to return to Bali in the future, and I already know where I will be staying.","This place is LUXURY.

I stayed at Luxe Villa for the first few days after landing in Bali and I was blown away with the design of the hotel (each corner of this oasis was impeccably designed and thought thru with a focus on all the details), the staff were beyond friendly (after just a few days they felt like a family and made Bali feel like home away from home) and the food. The food is beyond good, I had the best breakfast - something that I‚Äôll miss back home in New York!

Back to the people working at Luxe Villa: they‚Äôre extremely friendly and communicative. The concierge and the owners (Paul and Grace) will lead you in the right direction and help answer any questions you have about Bali - as well as help you plan activities.

Book your stay at Luxe Villa. I‚Äôm already looking forward on when I get the chance to come back.","If I could rate the team's service 6 stars I would!  Everyone recognized me always and with a warm smile, and so responsive over WhatsApp.  Just one example of the incredible service and care: I was out in Ubud shopping at a store that only took cash or local wire payment, but did not have either.  I messaged the property to assist, and they went ahead and took care of the payment without any pause. Will absolutely return again!!"
