Quite old. Not very clean at all. Had to wait over an hour for room service. Spa and massage quite expensive compared to local. We accidentally booked an extra night and they will not allow us to credit for the restaurant. Really disappointing experience for the end our trip. For the same amount of money you can book for a much better hotel.,"It's a cozy place to relax. The room is perfect for me, partner, and family they have a huge space and great view. We've got pool, ricefield, beautiful sunset, amazing garden, and romantic vibes everytime we walk out to balcony. The food is amazing, full of taste. This is a place to remember and a place to go to. It's not a destination. It's a home.

Shoutout to Mrs. Ari and team üëè","Very strange rooms with very bad lighting on the ground level and the upper deck is also not that great. They need to improve the lighting in the rooms, it's very dark and there is only one light for the entire floor.
The gym is very bad , small and dirty, the mats are worn out and the equipments are century old, and the view from the gym is terrible.
If you are on a budget trip and don't want to spend so much for your stay then this hotel is probably ok for you, but don't expect too much from this hotel.
The pool is good and it's nice to chill around in the evenings.
The bathroom is dirty with stains around the shower and the glass. The window is open so it's very easy for anyone outside looking at you taking shower directly if you are on the ground floor, so better take a higher floor.
I would definitely not be coming back to this hotel and I don't really recommend anyone to visit her unless you really have no money to spend on your stay.","Upon arrival we had to sign approval that there was construction work between 9am and 5pm.

We had really misjudged the distance to the beach and therefore (one of the reasons) wanted to cancel to go to a better location.  The friendly staff helped us with this.

Room has a large refrigerator and the possibility to cook for those who want (for a fee).

Large rooms with kitchen, bedroom and two toilets/1 shower.

We really didn't like that the wall near the shower is partially open and you can see through it, saw a man looking straight at me from the building across (5 meter?). We had to hang a towel there.

Airconditioning barely cooled, the bed is hard like wood and we had to clean the toilet seat before we could use it... we booked a garden view but looked at a wall with windows instead.

Very friendly personal and we had the best dinner in our 2 weeks on Bali at the restaurant!",Great spot! Great service! The staff were more than helpful! Really good food if you want to grab some breakfast before you head out! Highly recommend! Will definitely be back!

The staff is absolutely exceptional! Such friendly people that remember your name after the first day and really want you to have a great stay. Thank you so much!

Privacy is an important issue for any backpacker as we rarely have any, so no privacy curtains on the bunk beds is a bit of a bummer. It would also be nice if there were a door to the restroom/shower area. Listening to strangers bowel movements isn't super pleasant.","Nice small hotel with a swimming pool. Staff is extremely helpful. Leaving 3 star as we complained about a broken reading light and it was not fixed until the checkout time.

We were offered with a nice breakfast and great prices for the stay.  Good location and access to many restaurants in walking distance.","I couldn't be happier than I am right now after staying at Gelatik. From the moment I stepped into the reception, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, creating a welcoming atmosphere where everyone seemed like one big family. Their genuine care for the place was evident in its well-maintained and elegant appearance. The proximity to the beach and shops just across the street was convenient. The breakfast was outstanding, and the overall value for everything included was excellent. I highly suggest staying here to soak in the amazing vibes that I experienced!","I like the hostel so much! All the staffs are super nice helpful and friendly.The room is really big and the bed pretty comfortable as well!

Their pizzas and pastas are some of the best I've eaten in Bali this far. What makes it even better is they have 2 for 1 pizza special on Monday and Friday and 75k special on all pastas except for lasagna and risotto on Tuesday and Thursday.  Even at full price is easy here but with the specials you can't go wrong. The interior is nicely done and comfortable and the staff is great.  The oysters we good but nothing to brag about , at least they tasted fresh.  My son had the banana split dessert and out looked and tasted pretty good .

What I don't understand is the few times we've been here it's been fairly empty.  Admittedly there is not much foot traffic in this area but there is a lot of road traffic paying by coming through the shortcut","Be sure to read the descriptions of the dishes. My big mistake was not reading the description of the salad on the menu. I ordered a Caesar salad (all over the world this salad is made from chicken, cheese, croutons, lettuce and special sauce). To my great disappointment they brought me a Caesar with anchovies and bacon (without chicken). I hate anchovies. This was the worst Caesar salad for me.","I live around the corner from Bistro Anwa. The atmosphere and vibe is lovely.. and food has always been of a good standard.
We sometimes come on a Friday night for 2 for 1 pizzas and movie night which is brilliant for the kids. The rooftop is a really nice place to sit and see sunset.",The Anwa Bistro is a great find ! Modern building with leather bench seating and air conditioned . The food is varied and delicious . We had a coffee here in the morning and being from Sydney we love our coffee! This bistro doesn‚Äôt lose out to any comparisons with the best of coffee in Sydney. Worth a visit and when here check out the rooftop bar.,"First timer to this restaurant.

Bristro Anwa which located in Umalas Tunon offers something different ambience. They have first floor area and rooftop area for dine in.

If you are on motorbike this place is easy access from Canggu or Kerobokan.

I tried their Spaghetti, Steak, French Fries, Salad, Nachos and Chicken Wings üòã. All well presented and great taste.

Service is really nice and all staff attentive. Drinks just average. That night there were no vibes at all. Might not come back again.,"Really good food, the best Laksa noodle soups I ever had. Fish curry was very tasty too. They also gave us a small complementary soup starter with crostini that was delicious. Nice ambience, very friendly staff. Definitely recommend.","Dropped in to make a booking and was met by very pleasant staff. They couldn't hide their pride in the place.  It's got great ambience.  Upon arrive we were shown to our table.  We ordered the fisherman's basket and the 500 gram dry aged T bone steak. First the T bone arrived and about 5 mins later the fisherman's basket. We discovered later that the delay in the basket was due to issues with the fryer.  In future that will be corrected. The fisherman's basket which is one of their signature dishes is fresh, everything tender and crisp. Good quality produce. The T bone was cooked really well, medium rare, just as I requested.  Lovely porcini sauce. Only thing that let it down was perhaps quality of the sirloin side of the T bone.  Little bit tough and chewy. But good flavours.  Had a side of mash which was a little too salty to my taste. Service was friendly.  Will go back to try some of their other dishes and see if we can't lift the rating to 5 stars.","Loved everything here. Amazing velvety cauliflower cream. My steak sandwich was well presented, good combination of ingredients bursting with flavors. My wife's Vietnamese beef ball was quite delicious. Service was good. Will certainly return to try other menu items.","Nice atmosphere! Signature cocktails were too unbalanced for me. From too bitter to too sour. Room for improvement, i would say ‚úåÔ∏è"

Some places do one or two things well, Nourish does everything perfectly.
The bulletproof coffee is particularly nice. I often get the Bacon & Egg roll for breakfast and the Salmon Steak for dinner.","Great food and service!

Relaxing view of a rice paddy from the back deck or the busy streetscape from the front - ideal for a spot of people watching too!

While the majority of the food is focused on healthy options there is certainly something for everyone - my teenager was a huge fan of the Naughty Nourish for breakfast!

It‚Äôs truly a  tranquil paradise where you have 3 pools, a spa, a meditation house, a yoga studio, a delicious restaurant, a tea house and co-working spaces all available without ever having to leave the resort.  We also highly recommend taking their cooking class, it was incredible to learn how to make authentic Balinese dishes. We would love to come back next time we are in Bali !","Amazing eco hotel with vibe of relax surrounded by nature with friendly caring service. Great atmosphere for recharge and couple romantic. We selected it for honeymoon trip and it was the paradise. Service is super kind, you feel like at home, they were even coming to close curtains for us and open mosquito net in the evening. Besides delicious food at the restaurant- fusion Japanese and Mediterranean kitchen. You may take breakfast whenever you want during the day, real freedom of rest. The room is designed with natural materials in traditional style, beautiful and have everything you need. Outside bath garden was fancy. Highly recommend this place for couples and families to be on natural relaxing place. It is outside of the ocean, noise of traffic, bars and clubs but easy to reach it by taxi!","My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights. It was a little hard to find initially but once we entered we were taken aback by the beauty and serenity of the hotel. We had a whole villa house to ourselves next to a pool, every night the staff would setup bedside curtains to keep bugs out, and every morning when we had breakfast they would take all the curtains back in. We actually had an issue with the toilet not flushing properly, after raising it with the staff they fixed it right away.

I think we will remember the friendliness of the staff most strongly. They were very, very kind and patient with us, and went above and beyond in meeting our needs. For example my wife was having low blood sugar, and the staff brought out matcha cookies for us to snack on. Or they noticed we were carrying a lot of things before leaving for an excursion one time and they offered to keep our key for us (it's attached to a large totem object, it's a little inconvenient to carry around). Highly recommend staying with BK village for a well taken care of and serene stay in Bali!","It's just an incredible place. I am only 3 days in Bali, and this place impressed me so much that I will remember it forever! Unfortunately, all rooms in the hotel were occupied, so we could only stay for 1 day! But we were incredibly satisfied with even 1 day of stay there! A spa, a delicious restaurant with quality products, a special place for yoga and meditation!
I also want to note the extraordinary loyalty, service and simply incredible sincerity of the staff! You will always be in the first place for me personally! You are unsurpassed! Good luck! I hope to see you again soon‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèΩ","We had an outstanding stay at The BK Village, ten terrificly relaxing days in this beautiful hotel. We will for sure come back!

The environment is fantastic, what a harmonic mix of Balinese tradition and modern design elements. The hotel lies in a calm garden of palms, flowers, nicely arranged pools and local statues. The traditional houses are beautifully furnished.

The staff is a super lovely team that provides perfect service, vacation support and cleanliness. The front desk employees are extra helpful, everybody is very kind and sweet. There are yoga and pilates classes, excellent massages and treatment options - even on a short notice.

The kitchen is providing food all day, a variety of local and modern international breakfast, light lunch and super dinner with terrific Bali-Japanese fusion and sushi.

We spent full days relaxing at The BK village and used the hotel as starting point for sightseeing trips and beach days. The hotel team was always supporting with nice tips, secured taxis and rental motorbikes."

Absolutely NOT RECOMMENDED to book this place! A very laughable service! With some idiots as the staff!","Having lived in Bali for over four years and returning occasionally, I decided to revisit The Apartment Umalas for the second time, drawn by my positive past experience. The rooms boast a pleasing design, and the ambiance exudes relaxation, although, during my recent stay, construction works were underway, slightly diminishing the tranquility.

While one might expect higher-quality linens and limescale-free showers in such a setting, my disappointment this time stemmed primarily from the hotel‚Äôs eagerness to extract money from guests. It‚Äôs a common narrative in Bali; tourists are often seen as walking wallets.

My dissatisfaction peaked when I accidentally broke a small glass in the room and was promptly charged 30,000rp, roughly equivalent to ‚Ç¨2. It‚Äôs not about the amount per se; it‚Äôs about the principle it reflects. It‚Äôs akin to dining at a fine restaurant, accidentally breaking a glass, and being handed a bill for it‚Äîa stark departure from elegance, especially considering the substantial sum spent over the five-day stay, exceeding 5 million rupiahs.

While I appreciate the overall quality of The Apartment Umalas this incident left a sour taste, reminding me of the sometimes crass commercialism overshadowing genuine hospitality in Bali‚Äôs tourism industry","Highly recommend this place! The rooms are great and very clean. The garden is beautiful and has 3 great pools.

From the moment I walked through the door, I knew I was in for a treat. The restaurant's cozy ambiance and attentive staff set the stage for a delightful dining experience.

One dish that truly stole the show was their Beef Wellington. The perfectly cooked beef tenderloin, enveloped in a flaky pastry crust, was a masterpiece. Each bite revealed a succulent and flavorful combination of beef, mushrooms, and herbs. The dish was expertly executed, showcasing the chef's skill and attention to detail. If you're a fan of classic comfort food with a touch of elegance, this Beef Wellington is a must-try.

Moving on to the pasta, I was equally impressed. The restaurant offered a variety of pasta dishes, and I opted for their signature pasta with a rich tomato-based sauce. The pasta was cooked to al dente perfection, and the sauce had a delightful balance of flavors. It was evident that the chef used high-quality ingredients and took pride in creating a memorable pasta dish. Whether you're a pasta aficionado or simply appreciate a well-executed Italian classic, you won't be disappointed.

Lastly, the Onion Soup was a revelation. Served piping hot with a golden layer of melted cheese on top. The soup had a robust and savory flavor, with the sweetness of caramelized onions shining through. Each spoonful was a warm and comforting delight that left me wanting more.","Folie Bali is an absolute gem! The atmosphere is vibrant and inviting, the food is superb, and the service is top-notch. Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor, and the presentation was stunning. The staff were friendly and attentive, making our dining experience truly memorable. Can't wait to visit again! Highly recommend to anyone visiting Bali.",Love the food here. From pasta to beef wellington to its chocolate lava cake. Nice ambience in this place,"Great ambience, service and exceptional food standards. The beef Wellington is juicy, tender and delicious. Also, their iced tea is worth a try as well. The pistachio cake and chocolate tart are great picks for dessert.",Food was amazing... I couldn't believe it was empty on a Saturday night.   Wine was good... Beef Wellington was the best I've ever had.   I have lived here for years and most nights out don't thoroughly impress me.   Folie did... Great service as well!

Highly recommend!","Really impressed with the food. Good presentation, good quality, tasteful. Atmosphere is also nice, with a great playlist , nice variety of cocktails and wine. Service is also very attentive. Really recommended.

The lively ambiance and trendy decor contributed to the overall welcoming experience. The staff's attentive service further elevated the visit, ensuring a flawless dining experience. Notably, the DIY tacos were outstanding, with tender meat, fresh toppings, and warm tortillas crafting an unforgettable taste sensation.
For a different approach to traditional Mexican food MAIZE is a great option.",Best Mexican food I've had in my entire existence!  Fish tacos and beef quesadillas were phenomenal! Staff was great too!

The place has old world charm and so peaceful. Having a private pool is the best along with a large seating area and place for yoga. Bed was comfortable and AC was good. The bathroom is mostly outdoors with complete privacy. Friendly and helpful staff. Great restaurant called Nourish across the street.,"Spectacular. Loved the relaxing vibe and the attention from Rai and Pushpa and their team. The garden is beautiful, bed super comfortable, semi-open bathroom was great and beautiful, no insects at all to report. You feel like you are in nature but close to all spots in Canggu and great shopping nearby. Loved it very much. The breakfast is served at the villa and to order on the day before.","Fantastic Villa and Location!
This was our second time staying at Komea Villas. The villas are spacious, offer a private pool, and very clean. The staff at Komea are amazing, especially Puspa and Rai who made our stay amazing, and ever surprised me on my birthday with a lovely cake.","You can have your own little private jungle with a pool in an otherwise very busy and built in area. The room is lovely, the terrace is large and the pool is excellent for cooling off after spending a day ot and about. The staff was really nice and they get the breakfast delivered every morning from the restaurant Nourish just across the road. The location is actually great for visiting places around, but the reason for the 2 stars is because it is right on a busy road and for my liking the noise from the street from the scooters was too loud. There was construction also, but that can happen everywhere and is only temporary, hence I only took the scooter noises into consideration when giving 2 stars. Otherwise a great hotel with a very good atmosphere.","We stayed here for 11 nights with 3 adults and 1 baby, in a 2 bed villa. The place is beautiful, the hospitality is next level and the location is wonderful.  The care we received from all the staff was magnificent. I feel so relaxed after nearly two weeks here! We would recommend this place and stay again for sure.

Not so much cons, but worth noting so you can make an informed decision on if this villa suits your needs.
- The 2 bed villas are at the front, near a main road. Irs 24/7 busy and loud. Our baby actually liked the noise but if you are a light sleeper, you will not enjoy this.
- The villa is not baby safe. There's plenty of hazards for a young toddler who just started moving around. We hired a playpen which helped keep our baby safe
- The fridge is very small, it only fits a few cans and bottles.
- Cooking facilities aren't great. Download gojek in your home country before travel and get anything delivered 24/7
- The traffic in this part of Canggu is absolutely nuts (at time of writing Nov23) so plan accordingly.
- The breakfast in the villa is delicious and it's very relaxing to have it served to you poolside. However it comes from the Cafe across the road - Norish- who have the same menu items for much cheaper. So you pay a premium to take breakfast through the villa."

The service from the staff is outstanding nothing is ever too much for them.

Thank you Greg and all the Anwa staff.","Anwa Bali is the place to be if you are in Bali. Situated in a quiet neighbourhood so the perfect place to come home to after a busy day surfing, shopping and sightseeing. This is a very safe and secure environment and the restaurant and rooftop bar and staff is amazing.  Best Pizza in Bali.  The spa is top of the class and the staff very knowledgeable. If you want a good acupressure massage the spa is highly recommended.  Thank you to the hard working staff who are always available and very accommodating.  If you have a family and want a safe, secure and fun resort Anwa Bali residences are perfect! Private and quiet.","We enjoyed our stay at Anwa Bali and will definitely be staying again, we highly recommend it.

The resort is beautiful, our room was lovely and had so much storage space. The shower head was the best, its huge! It was nice not having to worry about the water as it's all filtered so we could drink it and brush our teeth. My hair was actually softer when we left then when i arrived!

Having Bistro Anwa with the delicious food (the pizza is amazing, we ate there a lot) the Roof Top Sports Bar (with incredible views, is a total vibe) along with Spa Anwa (they have great specials and the best massages) next door to the resort was so convenient and the decor is very stylish.

The staff were friendly and helpful, it was clean, tidy and safe. The location is central and is handy being close to Seminyak and Canggu. It's kid friendly with something for everyone.We Can't wait to go back! Thanks for having us.","Such a beautiful resort. The rooms were stunning, stylish and so clean, they have drinkable water too which is unheard of in Bali. The owners and staff were so hospitable, kind and provided the best service on the island!

Also, the key to having a good and friendly time here is having actual (friendly) people staying here, so you need to consider certain days that may not suit

I also enjoyed the pool. Its not too big but a really private one

Kudos to the hospitality crew David and Memet to always be ready to assist us with anything

Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt many other guests during my stay. There were a few day visitors, but not much action happening. That was made up for by the warmth & kindness of the staff - David & Mehmet. They were both welcoming & friendly, and made me feel comfortable being naked as they were also naked.
I had a private room, with a private bathroom, air con, & a very comfortable bed.There are also some wonderful restaurants nearby! I would definitely stay here again. Thank you üëç",Nice ‚Äúreceptionist‚Äù indeed but otherwise boring place. Most guest seem to stick to themselves with little to no interaction. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the trip if you‚Äôre looking for a nudist spot.,"The villa was fantastic - cozy, private, clean,  friendly hosts that made it feel like home, and a small community of like minded people.
The pool was clean surrounded by greenery, just wish there were more sun loungers.

One drawback was the mosquitoes since it was rainy season,  but most of the mosquitoes didn't seem to bite too much haha.","I stayed here at the dorm for almost a month between July - August 2022 and it's easily one of the best moments of my life. Met lots of like-minded people from across Indonesia and beyond. We went to the beach and searched for breakfast together. I keep in touch with some of them. The longer you stay, the more people you meet.

The place felt so homey, situated strategically between Seminyak and Canggu with plenty dining options. Owners and staff are super friendly. They have cool living room, textile-free swimming pool, and dining area with huge TV and couch, so it's easy for guests to socialize. Don't be shy, it's a perfect place to be ourselves.

Also they have this lovely, cuddly dog named Coco. Will definitely come back again when I have chance to.

My only suggestion for the dorm: improve the air circulation."

The four bedroom penthouse was great for our family - the pool was gorgeous, location great and the living areas were generously sized, luxurious and perfect for hanging out. We did a lot of cooking this trip, and the open kitchen and dining areas were a delight to use, meticulously designed with comfort and utility in mind and there is a full sized fridge and freezer for groceries and wine!

Our toddler had great fun climbing the spiral staircase, swimming in the rooftop pool and also wandering around in the rice paddies.

Would recommend this place to any discerning traveller looking for comfort, convenience and luxury.","My recent stay at The Revery was nothing short of a dream. From the moment I stepped through the door, I was captivated by the perfect blend of minimalist design and warm, inviting ambiance. The choice of furnishings and decor elements reflects a keen understanding of creating a comfortable and cozy environment, not only chic but also exceptionally well-executed.
This property is a masterpiece in itself, with a volumetric design that is a testament to architectural ingenuity, showcasing a harmonious blend of innovation and functionality. Comprising five distinct apartments, each unit is a unique and exquisite artwork.
The highlights of this house are the clever use of open spaces and the breathtaking 3 stories high staircase. Large windows and sliding doors allow natural light to flood the interiors, giving the space an airy feel.
The rooftop pool is the crown jewel, elevating the entire experience to a new level of luxury and relaxation. Perched high above the lush surroundings, the pool offers a serene oasis with breathtaking panoramic views of Bali's landscape.
But what makes this place truly special is the attentive hosting, ensuring a seamless and memorable stay. It's a perfect retreat for those who appreciate the art of minimalism without sacrificing comfort. Highly recommended for a rejuvenating experience in the heart of Bali.","Just had an amazing stay at The Revery! The staff is super friendly and made me feel right at home. Everything was spotless, which I loved. Plus, being so close to the beach and popular spots made it the perfect choice for a chill Christmas getaway.

Every corner of this villa is pristine, the attention to detail and esthetics are off the charts! The kitchen and dining area are nicely separated from the bedroom and living area making the place feel huge and giving tons of privacy.

It was so nice that they let us check in earlier But the cleanliness could  improve it ! It has stains on our bed and the bridge was full of soft drink stains as well......

The property gives a very peaceful and quiet vibe. Although it feels a pity that there‚Äôs not much guests yet, however this exudes serenity amidst the heavy traffic area between Seminyak/Canggu. Definitely a hidden gem for its price point.

Third floor suite rooms are amazingly spacious, clean and smells great too, the best part is the very strong water pressure for showers!

Do note to reserve your spa/massage session in advance, as it seems that the masseuse is on-call basis, and she was slightly late for my scheduled session. The 1.5hr mixed massage was fantastic, with a mix of traditional massage and hot stone massage.

Very bright villa opposite to many others in Bali.

Few concerns I‚Äôve had:
Last morning of our stay someone was on our rooftop walking and smoking early in the morning right where the bedroom is located, so I woke up due to the noice and the smell! I can‚Äôt stand the smell of cigarettes, so for me it was unbearable I had to wake up and go to living room.
Another concern was about the AC in bedroom. We never put it on in the bedroom but decided to do so last evening of our stay and as soon as I turned AC on, the smell of mold came in. Didn‚Äôt have time to let the staff know about it since it was late night, hopefully they check these reviews constantly and will resolve the issue in a timely manner.

The bedroom we‚Äôve had was covered in mirrors. I mean, the walls are the mirrors, so from any angle you stare at yourself. It‚Äôs metaphorical and scary at the same time.

All in all we loved our stay at Moon Villas, so I‚Äôd highly recommend checking it out!","I just wished I could give more stars to this place.
