During my stay for the Disability Rights Workshop, I noticed some areas for improvement regarding room accessibility. The hotel should provide accessible rooms for wheelchair users, including bathrooms with sliding doors. My colleague have to using toilet in the lobby when take a shower due to this inaccessibility. Additionally, they should avoid placing wheelchair users in isolated or hidden parts of the hotel. Despite this, the service was excellent. The staff was very helpful and showed great initiative, especially in the restaurant, in accommodating guests with disabilities.","Our stay at this hotel was fantastic! The staff were welcoming, the rooms were clean and comfy, and the premises were beautifully maintained. We loved the kitchenette and full-sized refrigerator in our room, along with the option to refill water jugs at water dispensers as needed ‚Äîa refreshing change from the limited bottled water provided at other hotels.

We treated ourselves to spa massages during our stay, which were truly rejuvenating and added to the overall relaxation experience. One of the highlights of our visit was enjoying a delightful dinner at the rooftop bar on our first evening, complete with a live performance that enhanced the ambiance and made it an unforgettable night.

The hotel's location is another highlight. In addition to a nearby mart for convenience, it's also conveniently situated within reasonable distance of charming cafes, lively bars, shops, and even the beach. While there was some nighttime noise from a nearby club, it was manageable and didn't significantly impact our overall enjoyment.

Overall, highly recommended for a memorable stay! We'll definitely consider returning whenever we find ourselves back in Bali.","The staff were excellent, always super kind and approachable. They won't walk by you without saying hello which makes you feel even more welcome.
The rooms were a good size and had everything we needed. When we first arrived, our room had a slight damp smell but the staff were quick to change our room (even with limited availability)
The pools were beautiful and always maintained and clean. The gym was also an added bonus.

We would visit again in a heartbeat.","The place is in a really good location(mind you I was riding bikes) if you're walking can be a bit of a walk to get anywhere. The closest convenience store is 5 min. The room was clean, I thought it was slightly over priced as I was on the ground floor. The restaurant looked good but I didn't eat there. The best part of the hotel is the rooftop pool, can def recommend for that","This is the second time I‚Äôm staying at citadines. This time I was given a room in the wing above reception. I felt this time my stay did not exceed my expectations like it did last time. The staff were polite but not particularly hospitable. Check in staff was more factual than welcoming.

The room also had some flaws: the hair dryer cannot be used in the bathroom as it short circuits the entire room - WHY was this not put up as a sign?! Also the DND/clean room switches had no sign on it, nor any light switches. The water pressure was weak, and the shower has its share of yellow and grey water stains. The plastic holder for the shower gel is moldy. They have smart TVs but don‚Äôt give you a way to access any apps! Noise from outside is very audible.

There are areas for improvement for sure. But the rooftop bar is nice - if towels were readily available and they served some coffee in the morning."

They have different genres in every night depending on what you feel like partying to. and the music is awesome!","It was one of my fav clubs in Bali; they played great music and had interesting light effects, and each day, they had a specific music theme.

I would say ‚ÄòThe Standard‚Äô dish is great value you for money as you get eggs if your choice, four slices of sourdough toast, cheese slices, jam and butter for 70k.

Great vibe and lovely staff.","We enjoyed this bakery cafe so much we returned to it for the last time (after 3 successful times we visited their Uluwatu branch). The BEST pastries in Bali!!

Their avo toast with poached egg & bacon was one of the BEST ones we had in Uluwatu, so we had to order it again in this branch, and it definitely didn't fail! The egg was runny and perfectly made, so delicious.

We also ordered their granola yogurt which was so fresh and tasty.
Lastly, we took the coconut croissant which was soooo amazing!! If you need to choose only one pastry out of their great selection, make sure to choose this one!","I came here for brunch. Crowded even in weekdays, but now i know why its crowded üòÇ the food is really great & i really recommend to try their coffee (i order iced latte w oatmilk) ü•∞

The food preparation which was happening in front of us was impeccable and the chef explaining each dish added to the whole experience. Ambiance was relaxing yet engaging. The food itself was delicious with interesting flavour profiles with a mix of refreshing small bites and high quality ingredients. We would recommend the Tom yum shiromi!,"This place is just incredible, THE place to go in Bali. The food was like nothing I've ever experienced, so well prepared, so full of flavour and so carefully presented. The decor is intimate and plush and the vibe was amazing the night I was there. We were at Tuesday Tokyo night and they went all out with dancers and costumes. The cocktails were also fantastic. Would highly recommend, loved it.","Went there with a friend for dinner on a Tuesday night. First, service was excellent. Everyone was super friendly and gave us great recommendations.

We sat by the bar and we initially ordered a la carte but were still hungry after all that and they gave us the option to have some of the omakase options and the showmanship, the flair, the flavour, the taste.. everything was 10/10!

Was also pleasantly surprised when dessert time came and they came out with not one but two desserts (we did order them) and a birthday song for me!

Rooms, location and resort are great. My partner and I are keen into fitness but the gymnasium is more like a broom closet  only 1 treadmill that did not work, and a set of 8 free weights which they called a fitness centre.
Staff were lovely but service was very slow. To our disappointment we asked for a late checkout when the resort was at 30% capacity and were told we had to pay a premium to have the room for an additional 4 hours. Was extremely disappointing after being there for a week and spending a lot of money to be there. Great resort but management need to learn to think outside the square.
Also lacked a bit of ambience. A little background music at the pool wouldn‚Äôt have gone astray.
The showers we had to use after we checked out were full of black mould, looked like had not been cleaned for months, and had no privacy. A male hotel guest walked in on me while changing as was no way to lock the door.
When we spoke to the manager on duty, seemed more interested in the video game on his screen than of my concern. .","I had the most amazing time, the room was clean and luxurious, the service was always fast and with a smile. The food in both restaurants was absolutely delicious and a very reasonable price, I highly recommend the ‚Äústeak manager‚Äù.

The bonus stuff that comes with it, free afternoon tea and beer, free wine tasting, free entry to atlas beach club is what really sells the place. Rooms can be updated but they try their best to keep it clean. We had a wonderful stay!",We are very happy with the service of Swarga Suites. They have complete amenities and we enjoyed all of them. We had a massage at the spa and it was amazing. Buffet breakfast was really nice with a lot of selection.

The portions are so tiny (see photo‚Äîone slice of salmon üòÇ) and the dishes have high bottoms, so you can finish everything with just three forkfuls. The worst coffee we've had in Canggu.

Great pastries, coffee also smooth, good vibe to hand or work. The sandwiches not my favorite.

Its a sibling brand with 7AM. Worth a visit!

I think coffee could be definitely be improved. I recommend this place for breakfast or to buy your bread or pastries for the day.

The pizzas here are great - super thin and deliciously flavourful, just how authentic Italian pizza should be. Although I would have preferred them to be slightly crispier, the overall taste was still fantastic.

A standout for us was the cheese, particularly the Burrata, which was exceptionally fresh and soft, melting beautifully with every bite.","We really enjoyed our pizzas here, they tasted like Italian pizza, as it should, not like Indonesian chefs making a mess out of Italian dishes, like in other places.

The sourdough base was yum. What I didn‚Äôt like was that what I thought was bacon was more like ham. If it had real bacon, it would have been amazing.","The location is exactly as shown on the maps.

I practically consider it my second home since I'm here almost every day. The food is consistently delicious, and the service is top-notch - the staff here are so attentive, they feel like family.

It's no wonder every time I bring friends along, they instantly fall in love with the place too. In fact, it's getting a bit tricky to snag a table lately!

Their breakfast menu, which conveniently lasts until 3 pm, is my jam, especially since I'm into intermittent fasting (so I get my breakfast meal in the afternoon). Starting off with a bulletproof coffee, I always dive into my all-time favorites: the prosciutto and ricotta omelette, breaky tacos, smashed avo and salmon scramble. Their sourdough is just perfect, and accompanied almost every breakfast dish.

For dinner, my go-to options never disappoint: the New Zealand grass-fed beef tenderloin, seared barramundi, and pan-seared salmon hit the spot every time.

However, because is an Eco hotel they do not intervene with any animal presence in the hostel, that includes mouses and for what I hear above my hut, rats. This was very unpleasant specially at night! They were running all over and I was afraid of them entering my room. But if you don‚Äôt have any problem and you have a similar Eco environmental vibe it will be fine for you!","I really enjoyed my 10 days here with the yin classes and breakfast buffet being my absolute favourite. Other things such as daily room cleaning, mosquito, shampoo/body soap and spa services being provided were a plus. The staff were amazing and very kind as well as the other guests that gravitate here and restaurant it was easy to meet new friends. I left abruptly and forgot to say goodbye to the staff! It was the peaceful paradise I was really looking for in Bali! Thank you:)","As a solo traveller for the first time, i wanted to be in a safe place, calm, peaceful with good services. That is everything Serenity Eco House has offered me. I will definitely go back if i am in Canggu because it offers the calm but also is so near from the beach. I have met wonderful people (staffs and travelers) and i encourage you to try a few nights (you ll probably stay longer if you love calm, yoga, beautiful environnement).","I always have a lovely yoga session with Helena, her classes are amazing and I always come when she‚Äôs teaching there! ‚ù§Ô∏è such a great energy and I‚Äòm always learning sooo much üåü if you see that she‚Äôs teaching you should definitely check out her classes, they are one of a kind ü´∂üèº"

We loved our villa and our own little pool. The very attentive staff is always there and answers immediately to any message. It is very safe with security at the front. The little hotel buggy drives you to nearby restaurants, shops and clubs. We enjoyed the brand new and big fitness studio which has a very high standard. Everything was very clean. The location is in between Old Man‚Äôs and Finns if you walk along the beach. We were very sad to leave but we will definitely stay here again when we come back to Bali. It was by far the best place we ever stayed in Bali. Thank you Secana for making our holiday so special.","I stayed at Secanatown for a month and I loved it. Rooms are very big, so great if you are staying for a while. The gym is awesome. Got all equipment you need for a good workout, including recovery centre (ice bath, sauna). And the staff is amazing. Great service, super sweet and 24/7 standby. Location is great. Berawa is close to all the nice beach clubs, restaurants etc in Canggu. I def will come back to Secana next time I'm in Canggu.","My wife and I recently stayed at Secana Beachtown for 10 days. Here's a detailed review of our experience.

Positives:
- Accommodation: The lofts are comfortable, spacious, and exactly as pictured.

- Amenities: The rooftop pool offers a great view of the ocean, and the gym is equipped with a variety of equipment.

- Location: The location of the property was a highlight for us, providing convenient access to the beach, restaurants and shopping.

Constructive Criticism:
- Restaurant: The restaurant service is slow, and the food is bland. We had to seat ourselves and waited quite a while before my wife had to get up to grab a menu, despite the presence of employees.

-Security: There is only one door preventing unauthorized entry into the building where the lofts are located, and it‚Äôs never fully shut. Anyone can walk in from off the street and enter a loft if it‚Äôs open from housekeeping. This lack of security is concerning.

- Housekeeping and Privacy: Despite requesting room cleaning at 10:45 am, our room was still not cleaned when we returned at 3 pm. Additionally, we found three individuals in our room, who did not introduce themselves until we inquired. They claimed to be IT staff fixing the TV, although we had not reported any issues nor gave them permission to enter. Reception was completely unaware of them entering the room and there is no system for them to track who enters/when.

- Communication: When we broached this with reception we were informed that this is an issue they are working on. Another instance of unauthorized room entry occurred as we were at reception voicing these concerns. Basically if your DND light is not on it is a free for all to enter your room.

- Management Response:* While the manager apologized and offered an additional 3 hours towards our late check-out, this did not fully address our concerns about privacy and security.

Conclusion:
While Secana Beachtown has many positive aspects, significant improvements are needed in communication, security, and service. If safety is not a primary concern for you, this might be the place for you. However, if you value privacy and reliable service, you may want to consider other options.","Super loft hotel! Our loft had a magnificent view of the ocean! New, clean and very stylish hotel. The location is excellent - close to all infrastructure. There are no construction sites nearby, and therefore complete silence. Excellent gym, free for hotel guests. But you need to know that you can only lie on the roof by the pool by renting a sun lounger. This is the only thing that spoiled our stay here! We'll definitely be back!","Centrally located and plenty to do within walking distance. I booked the Villa with the private pool and it was amazing. Very new and modern, the staff was incredibly helpful and came in clutch multiple times for me.

I will definitely come back and stay at Secana!"

Bartender Kevin was a nice host for us and a really nice guy who knows what hes doin. Thanks!","We came on Christmas Day for dinner and everything was excellent, the staff were friendly but not overbearing and really helpful. The pasta dish was exceptional, steak was great but the highlight was the dessert! The tiramisu was amazing but what blew my mind was the pineapple carpaccio","I recently visited Riviera Bistro in Bali, Canggu, and unfortunately, my experience didn't meet my expectations. The fried pork I ordered was disappointingly thin, tough and had barely any meat on it, which was not at all what I was hoping for in my meal. Additionally, the pasta dish I tried was overwhelmingly salty, to the point where it was difficult to enjoy the flavors intended. However, I do want to acknowledge that the staff at Riviera Bistro were pleasant and nice, which was a positive aspect of my visit. Despite their friendly service, the food quality and preparation significantly impacted my dining experience. It was pretty pricey too.","Always a good time in Riviera!
Wahyu the manager was really kind to offer us some limoncello to close our dinner. It was really good!","Lovely italian restaurant that sees a later evening crowd. The layout of the restaurant is good for friendly groups but can pretty loud if the group is rambunctious.
Service is attentive and friendly.
The food was really good quality and every dish was perfectly executed. I really enjoyed the deep fried zucchini flower filled with mascarpone. So good! Its light batter and light cheese filled crunchy sticks of flowers was definitely the highlight of our meal.
Their clams with chickpeas is also another winner. The fresh clams although a little small, were super tasty and the broth in the bowl was rich from its juices and hearty with chickpeas.
We also had the mackerel and the fried pork.
The food although was pricey, it was well worth the quality and standard"

The still river in the back of the resort is kinda smelly (if you stand close) but didn't bother us at all.

All in all, this is the place to go in Canggu. If you have some doubt, don't.","The ambiance of the hotel is absolutely amazing. We stayed in the teak villa with private swimming pool with our little one, which was perfect for our family.

The rooms are spacious, well appointed and quiet. The pools were divine. It‚Äôs a 3 minute walk to the beach and easy 10-15 minute walk to all the restaurants/shopping. Extra perks including a free daily class at their ZINfit studio and a complimentary foot massage made the stay even more special. Breakfast and food at the ZIN Cafe was tasty and the service was second to none. Special shout out to Puspita who went put of her way to make a personal connection."

The guy called ‚ÄúApril ‚Äú, didn‚Äôt allowed me me in, probably he wanted to impress his girl colleague.

I asked him why he denied my entrance and he turned his head arrogantly away.

An explanation would be appreciated‚Ä¶.

If i was wearing a tanktop, I would not even try to enter, as i could read the policy rules very clearly.

Next time of ignooring me in an arrogant way, at least explain me why yoy think an oversized sleeves handmade shirt is in your eyes the same as a tanktop.

And at least say it in a friendly way and don‚Äôt treat me like a criminal not dressing as u like.

The bar is a beautiful spot where everyone chills in the evening. With pool tables available, it felt too good to be true. I highly recommend this hostel for anyone looking for a fun and welcoming place to stay!","my husband stayed here for a week alone and we wanted to come together because he was so pleased. but unfortunately everything we encountered was very different from his experience. first of all, the hostel is divided into two, there are two different areas. while the back area is very noisy, the front area is much quieter and very different from each other, also its the same price! they took us to the back part and even we came there at 3 pm, our beds were not ready yet! i mean the check in hour is already too late and the only thing you have to do is change the bed sheets? anyways the rooms were so small and cramped that we had to take our bags to our bed and sleep. there isn't even room to put a bag. there was only space for bunk beds. when we explained the situation, they changed our room the next day. they took us out of our room at 12 pm as if we were checking out and said that we have to wait for our new room (which was already empty and ready) until 3 pm. when we asked why we had to wait because we had already checked in, the woman at the reception spoke to us in a very harsh and aggressive manner. if you are making a change so that we will be satisfied, your attitude and tone should be the same! or, when the rooms are so different from each other, it is very unfair to price each room the same. i don't think I'll ever come here again. they don't care about your satisfaction when you don't speak up, and they are very rude when you do!
we continued to stay just because there was a pool and we had a few days left, but i wish we had gone somewhere else!

Now Police claim wouldn‚Äôt help but more security at the hostel would have prevented this

There is no work area. Very loud during nighttime. Music very loud everywhere. No possible to call anyone. Apart from that it's a nice place. Also not easily accessible power socket beside bed. I would give you 5 stars but too loud for work. Dissapointed a bit.,"Doesn‚Äôt feels like a hostel but more than an hotel.
