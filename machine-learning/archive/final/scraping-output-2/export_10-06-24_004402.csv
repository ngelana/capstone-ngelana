We were the only people there! All of the areas were accessible, nothing was closed off. We got the chance to really see all the beautiful details up close, it made for a contemplative session walking through the amazing mixture of natural scenery taking over the human made stone carvings.","My favourite temple in Bali.  Find out when the next Odalan is (temple birthday) and go then!   It is a very significant temple and keeps the old traditions.  Everyone is welcome at a Hindu Temple.  That is the way here in Bali - all inclusive.  Take a Balinese friend with you - and it is not hard to befriend a local!  This temple has such a powerful energy and historically is one of the most important temples. Often the Odalan ceremony goes for 3 weeks!  Opera, drama, dancing - till 0200 am!   Stop and listen to the gamelan.  Just stop.  It's meditative and soothing to the soul.  Every musician plays for God.  You see that, you feel that.  Every time I visit the people are so happy and so friendly. You will no doubt make a fiend on the day you go.","This place is wonderful, peaceful and stunning. One of our favorite temples in Ubud, but please, be careful with the dog, it can be quite aggressive and follow you around anywhere you go. Do not panic, remain calm and he will leave (or be called by someone in the temple). There is no entry fee, but you will be asked to provide a donation at the end of your visit.","Had the entire temple grounds to myself. Very picturesque, large temple grounds. There was not even a caretaker present. Highly recommend a visit. Better than many of the more popular temples."

The ricefields around are beautiful + a river you can walk along. Highly recommend. There are also coffee shops","one of the best ancient tourist destinations.

The people around are great. It's a small community with an own Kindergarden. Of course during the day you can here the kinds, but for me it's totally fine. It starts at 9 so it's not a problem to get wake up. The owners live also in the community so you get help all the time if needed. It's simple but beautiful and you have everything there you need.  I recommend it and i will come back for sure.","I was with my girlfriend only in transit, but the two days we felt very comfortable. A nice place to recharge your batteries for all the other experiences in Bali. For us it is always important to feel welcome and not just a tourist. Therefore five stars from us!","Stayed at Sairam House again with our daughter. LOVE this place next to the rice fields, with cats, dogs, playground and pool for her to be entertained. Amazing hosts!","A great place to stay, very welcoming host","Amazing rice field views and family comunity feeling!

We stayed two months at Sairam House and the comunity with its families as well as Tamir and Ksenija made us feel like home. The place is magic! We loved our house, especially the fantastic views from the first floor. The Sairam House team took very good care of everything and helped us with all we needed. Our daughter loved joining the Kundalini playground next door and made good friends and countless great experiences. We will hopefully come back soon!!!"

Hope the owner can explain this as i feel uncomfortable eating there. The place got a lot of mosquitoes and seems not taken care of as there's a lot of spider web in the ornaments. All in all its a good experience.

Edit : condiments were dirty and got flies, and the staff didn't do anything.
3 star i guess since the noodles taste the same.","The staff was helpfull and the vibe was amazing.

But the food didn't suit my taste, sorry.
It looks like indo-chinese type of nooddles but they use fried shallot and fried garlic instead of boiled/raw one
It looks like chinese noodle but taste like traditional/local noodles. It taste confusing for me. Imagine chinese style noodles but taste like Bakmi Jawa üò≠
Also my kwetiau have no taste AT ALL, it taste a bit like stale kwetiau, but no salty, savoury, or anything like that.
And i think they didn't use any sesame oil or chicken/pork oil at all. I had to ask for soy sauce but still didn't satisfy my appetite. For kwetiau lover, i didn't even finish my meal because it's just bad ü•π

The Bipang was great tho, very tasty and salty. But dang too pricey for me, 20k for 5 slice of pork?

Pangsit goreng was nice but the meat filling is too littleüò≠

Jeruk peras was good tho at least","Located inside small road, surrounded with caricatures and few antiques. Noodles are yummy.","I just remember to post this even though I've been here several times.
This is one of the best noodle place that you should try in Bali. The pork noodle seem regular at first, but then you feel the crispy pork fat that pops as you chew. When they added charsiu & roast pork menu, it couldn't get any better.
The place located few minutes out of Ubud, you'll be surrounded by greens as you seat and surprisingly there is a comic museum lodged in the same space.
So you'll have something to look around while you're waiting your orders to be ready.
Highly recommend, I've heard they opened another one in Denpasar, so give it a try since it's not so far from you if you're on the south part of Bali.","Worth to try. Price is fair due to their location is in busy area so the highest price that they have is 45k. The place is not that big, so if they're full you have to wait. The place is clean but how they keep the cutleries on the table is not clean for meüòÖ the cutleries basket doesn't have the cover. the staff is friendly. The payment can be cash, card or QR. Safety for children. As far as i see they don't have baby seater. So not friendly for baby but okay for toddler. The food is out lil bit slow, im wait about 20min. but luckily it's worth to wait cause it taste good. I wish that they sell the crisp pork belly separate with the noodle so i can eat it with rice at homeüòå The portion is small to average. The soup also me likey cause it contain ginger flavor. We will def comeback."

The cafe itself was closed the last time I went there, but the restaurant is always open. Enjoy the cold pressed juice while staring at the lush rice fields. If you feel hungry, choose one menu cooked by the owner to comfort your empty belly. I ordered a lemongrass tea last time and it was freshly harvested before serving.","Beautiful, natural, tranquil seting for this fresh cafe. My young coconut came straight from the garden. Ice made from filtered water.","An insider tip near the Yeh Pulu Temple is the Yeh Pulu Caf√© overlooking rice terraces.  The place is quite hidden but definitely a great place for tasty refreshments like fresh fruit shakes and some local dishes. The place is very idyllic and pleasant for a stay in the countryside.  There is a homestay and as already mentioned a temple nearby.  We had a homemade juice with tamarind, ginger and lime that is said to have a detoxifying effect and, like all juices, it was freshly prepared from really nice stuff.","What a hidden gem! A tranquil setting in this beautiful garden was the perfect backdrop for the best dinner of our trip. One of us was gluten free, so we showed a coeliac restaurant card we brought and they understood really well. It was very easy for them to show us what options could be made gluten free.

Everything we had was incredible. Super fresh juices from their own produce. Gorgeous teapot and cups with nice and strong ginger & lemongrass tea. We had mie goreng (not GF) and steamed Balinese infused flavoured rice with chicken sate sticks (adapted to be gluten free without fuss). Both were 10/10. Perfectly succulent juicy chicken in each, the rice was morish and very well balanced flavour in the mie goreng.

Dessert was just as good!

Can't recommend enough for you get out of busy Ubud and experience the amazing local Balinese cuisine at this restaurant."
