I very much enjoyed the tranquility of the place, where you simply only hear the surrounding nature. Rooms are basic, clean and comfortable.",Nice and clean room. Wonderful host who try to be helpful. Great value. And they provide bottled water which was basic but a life saver. ( some homestay they don‚Äôt ) If u like a quiet and easy place to stay this is for you. The room is actually facing a huge price of rice paddies but right now it‚Äôs blocked by the forest. It‚Äôd be a game changer if the bush is cleared. There ain‚Äôt much around in the area. So prepare yourself if you are heading there.,"We were very well received at this lodge in the middle of nature, where you can only hear the sound of nature. The coffee comes from the tree in the garden, and the traditional breakfast is prepared with ingredients from the surrounding area. A rejuvenating interlude to see Bali differently.","We arrived without expectation to another homestay but they were booked. They helped us find this place owned by Dharma. His uncle, Babe, had a room for us in a nearby hostel. They have made sure in each moment we were satisfied, safe and happy. Gave us recommendations of what to do. Local and delicious breakfast, tea, towels, shampoo, fresh water and even a ride to the capital so we could find a better transport to Medewi. The village is full of nice people and it is a beautiful place just 10 minutes away from the UNESCO world heritage rice fields in Jatilwih.

Best best hostel and hosts!!!","a comfortable place,fresh air and beautiful scenery üôè"
