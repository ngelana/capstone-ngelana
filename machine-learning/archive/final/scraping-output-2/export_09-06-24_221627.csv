Overall good option to choose.","A beautifully landscaped tranquil haven right on the beach. Very comfortable private bungalows, two pools and an affordable on site spa. The restaurant is on the beach. Breakfast by the ocean was the highlight of my day. You can snorkel directly in front of the private beach in crystal clear warm water and the dive shop is adjacent.

The rooms were clean and beautiful, the bathroom was fantastic, the restaurant on the beach is very, very good (and has a great atmosphere), staff is friendly and snorkeling from the beach is also very nice.","Love this place.

Definitely give a donation to keep this project alive.,"Kudos to those who are actually doing the work!If anyone wants to help, learn, understand, do pop by.

There's a Rp 40k entrance fee, which would help run the place. And what you get is information about how the eggs are saved, incubated, hatched, put into a tank, then released. Absolutely worth it.

If you're lucky, you'll get to be involved in that cycle. Or, at least, get to witness the little ones. Just make sure you're there in the right season.","I’d recommend stopping by this place! Clearly having a big impact for a relatively small outfit. 40k entrance fee valid for a week, and a great explanation on their conservation work. Turtles of all ages to see! If the timing is right you can also pay 100k to release a turtle to the ocean.","Really good experience.  They receive and hatch hundreds of eggs, saving them from being eaten by dogs, snakes and birds.  Great to see them and know that they will be released back into the see to continue the cycle. A really great contribution to maintaining the turtle population of north Bali. Four of us just turned up, a small contribution and a quick tour and talk, perfect","Save a turtle, visit their project. 40K entry per person. But loved to see baby turtles.

Visit early, if you are lucky you can name a turtle and set them free. We where unlucky and only got to see 2 months old baby’s

Still a lovely experience"

The plants and pond are beautiful, i stayed in number 7, Lotus villa and it was a great time staying there. The beach is fairly clean and good for snorkeling in good weather. The animals are tame and cute. I will 💯 go back :)))","Beautiful grounds!  Friendly and helpful staff!  The restaurant is on the beach so the view is perfect.   And if you like to dive, Karang Shop is on the same grounds.   Shore dive is muck with fun finds.   Or boat to Menjangan island for beautiful corals.","Impressive old hotel. Clean, spacious, and well-maintained.

Tried the food. Burger was ok, fish & chips were good. They use tuna. Weird pricing for coffee and some menu: Americano is (45 + 21%) higher than latte 35 + 21%  ha ha ha..

Overall we were satisfied.","We stayed in this Villas (Amertha Bali Villas) back in July 2023 with my husband, brother in law and niece during our visits to Bali Indonesia. Two nights we stayed in the big group 4 villas behind the Reception.
Outside the wall people burn trash so we swallowed all the smoke, and the  dog barking all night long.

The third nights we moved to the Ocean View Villa with 3 bed rooms which initially we requested to be in the ocean view villas.

The compound has 12 units Villas with different owner. 3 Villas with Ocean View.

The ground is very nice with all flowers and trees here and there.

Each Villas has pool and there is also public pool near by the restaurant.

The Mattress is too old and create some wavy like a big hole, after wake up all my body is aching. I know the owner is from Denver, Colorado US. We met during our first stay between 2012-2014. We stayed in Villa number 7 which is the smaller villa behind the Ocean View Villa.

You think you paid $500 per night the mattress should be at least good for sleep but not at all.

When we check out at front desk I told to the reception desk that the mattress need to get rid and buy a new one.
I even say please tell Mr. Owner (I will not stated his real name) the mattress need to be change.

I told them in our house we changed mattress at least every 5 years.

The other problem is the sink  clocked, the hot water not running smoothly.
The menu in the restaurant is ok we ordered most Indonesian food.

If they change all the mattress I may come back.

I don’t normally give review but this time I did in order to help others to choose the best places for their family vacation. Overall we enjoyed our vacation in Bali, in view different places and our driver help us to find every good restaurant in every corner or village in Bali.","I just got home from staying at the Amertha Bali Villas in Pemuteran, Bali. This place is a little slice of heaven. Just a gorgeous setting with the mountains in the background and beach right on the property. The staff were extremely accommodating and so kind and supportive. Sandy is the manager and he gets to know every one who stays there, making sure your experience is wonderful. The villas are gorgeous, spacious, with a pool for each villa. The grounds are absolutely beautiful. And your stay wouldn't be complete without taking advantage of their spectacular spa treatments! Go snorkeling, as the water is calm, very warm and the fish are amazing to observe. I highly recommend a stay at the Amertha Bali Villas"

So close to the beach, amazing snorkeling and amenities. Temples and monkeys are a close drive away too. Thank you for such a wonderful time.","At last a decent shower, it’s just the greatest.
I actually love this place, despite a few minor issues that can be easily overlooked.
Basically the issues are the front door and bathroom door don’t fully close. You can make a wedge to close them if there are mozzies around but we didn’t need to.

Staff were great on arrival and were very happy to help me communicate with another hotel and police on a matter that happened elsewhere.
All the staff here are very friendly, they all introduced themselves as we met them and they remembered our names.

The room was great, bed was fine, mozzie net did its job and the shower was awesome ( we haven’t showered in 6days properly )

Pool was great, pool bar served great drinks, restaurant was good and food was fine and presented very well.

Onsite scuba gear was shocking but dives were cheap. I would have done a quick service on the bcd prior to wearing but regs were passable.

About 30m to the beach
150 to Bio Rock","This is a fabulous place to stay, the management, staff, and owner are brilliant together as a team and provide you with the perfect package of relaxed, safe, and a beautiful environment with a professional and easy to deal with attitude while being attentive to your individual requirements. The beach access to take yourself snoorkling/swimming is so quick in your swimming gear, it is a delight to then come back to a quiet haven with a lovely pool (with bar and towels) to relax by -- the whole place is set in well developed gardens that are maintained extremely well. The restaurant is great and provides consistently delicious food with exemplary service. The spa has a good list and a pleasure to take advantage of. Housekeeping service rooms daily and note personal details to make your stay even more comfortable. This is not for the price is great, this is just simply a fantastic place. Stay and enjoy being looked after.","Amazing hotel in a great place. We loved everything about Tirta Sari: the food, the rooms, the garden and swimming pool, the spa and even the activities (snorkeling trip to the island). And the staff is just lovely, which made our stay even more pleasant.
The hotel is nested in quiet place, very close to the beach (that has coral reefs and pretty fishes), which made our stay very relaxing. I also really like Pemuteran, which is much quieter and more authentic than Ubud/ the south of Bali. If I could give 6 stars, I would!","We just stoped by for dinner..
The food was excellent,  so was the service. We would absolutely recommend it,  and we will definitely come back.

(There is also a sign written)
I'm not a diver but for me it was really nice and many different fish including a pufferfish one day.",The water was not clear and some of the corals had already died. No fee entrance or parking fee. However it's a good place to spend the day at the beach.,"Hmmmm depends, the concept is excellent and they are doing an amazing job!! I dived here and the diving was interesting but very beginners and average. Not biorocks fault but my dive operator should have taken me somewhere else.

Personally, I enjoyed my massage, but my partner did not. What surprised us was the 21% tax and service charge added to an already relatively expensive massage by Bali standards. This information was not communicated clearly beforehand. I'm leaving this review to inform others about potential additional costs to consider. Despite this, the staff was delightful, and the location and hotel are beautiful.","We had stayed here 20 years ago.   While we were not staying there this time we had many drinks and meals at the hotel.

It's a beautiful garden and looks the same as it di then.   It's well-maintained.   The staff are very attentive and friendly.

We had many lunchtime snacks, cocktails in the evening and we went for dinner twice.

The food is great, well prepared, fresh and authentic.

The location is amazing and next time we will definitely stay there again.","We stayed almost one week in the Pondok Sari resort. We booked a spacious colonial wooden bungalow which was beautifully decorated. The resort is in the middle of a green jungle garden. The sea is at your finger tips and the staff is very friendly. The only downside was the quality of the food.  The breakfast is a bit basic and the dinner is not value for money. The food we order for dinner was a bit cold,even the extra rice was not warm.Good thing is that there are plenty good warungs in the proximity of the resort. Overall, a good and pleasant resort to stay.","I really wanted to love this place, but there were a few problems.  First, I will say that the guest services man, named Michael, went above and beyond his duties by obtaining medicine for me when I was sick.  He was fluent in English, unobtrusive but always available and very pleasant.  Cheers to Michael!  However beautifully designed this resort it, the filigree above the door to our room was so low that my husband, who is 6'2"" had to duck to get in and out of the door.  Several times he really hit the metal filigree hard.  Inconvenient for him. Also, the door had a huge gap at the bottom, which allowed insects to come into our room every night. The actual door handles were in the rustic design, which I did not like.  The doors to the outside really were never completely closed and sealed.  All doors were always slightly ajar, which wasted a lot of the a/c.  The beach area is very nice with lots of shade and unlike most beaches in the area did not have tons of boats anchored, so swimming was very good.  The food was fine, nothing to rave about.  The laundry service was prompt and well priced.  The bed and pillows were not up to the standard of any of the other hotels I've stayed in in the two months I've been travelling in Indonesia, the bed had a seam in the middle, which  made cuddling uncomfortable.  The pillows were not that good, either.  The spa was beautiful but massages were overpriced and their oils did not smell very fresh."

Ondřej and Veronika from Czech Republic.",I rated this hotel 2 out of 5 stars because we lost electricity at 1:30 AM and it got extremely hot in the room. I woke up in a pile of sweat absolutely soaked. After complaining to the manager for an hour and a half he finally woke the owner up who apologized and FINALLY moved us into a new room. The employee had 0 critical thinking skills. Moving us to a new room is obviously the correct thing to do immediately for your guest so they can go back to sleep. I'm exhausted this morning and have to conduct business on half energy. I do not recommend anyone to stay here because if something goes wrong it is proven that it will take a good amount of time to be resolved.,"Terrible experience! DO NOT STAY HERE! I am not one to complain but this hotel is of very low quality. Definitely not a 3 star hotel!

Our room lost electricity in the middle of the night and as a result the room was unbearably hot. Things happen but the response was inadequate.

The customer service representative sleeping on the couch checked the fuse box and said he would fix the issue. Adter nearly 45 minutes of no solution, I went back downstairs and saw the representative just staring at his phone. I requested to speak to the owner on the phone and he stated that he needs to pay for electricity which was shocking. I politely suggested to give us another room or our money back but he replied that he needed to check availability, which was ridiculous because there were several rooms available. He didn’t even have the courtesy to provide us a fan.

After another 45 minutes in the hot room, my friend who was also staying in the room complained again (my frustration was peaked at this time and could not deal with the hotel staff any longer) to the owner who finally gave us one of the other available rooms.

There were other issues but I don’t want to go on a rant. My advice is DO NOT STAY HERE! There are much better alternatives in the area also at a better price.","I would definitely stay at Arjuna Homestay again if visiting Pemuteran and diving with Dive Concepts. The dive concepts team
Operates at the homestay so made it very convenient. The breakfast was lovely and rooms were good. Will be recommending friends and family to stay here when diving. The lady at the front desk was very lovely and nice too.

My favourites were Tum Ayam , crispy fish fingers and the chocolate volcano dessert, but everything we had was delicious. There was a good selection of hot and cold drinks.","Went a couple times over our stay and enjoyed our meals. My husband ordered the curry sandwich and enjoyed it but said that it was pretty mild.
The chicken satay was good, I do wish it came with more veggies though.

Not pictured but we did order the chocolate lava cake, based on someone else’s review we made sure to order it when we ordered our entrees. It still took about 30 minutes after we finished eating for it to arrive.

Went back another time to try the Pad Thai and it good but slightly sweeter than you would expect.
The staff are very friendly and overall the food was good.","Without doubt the best food I ate in whole Bali. Went there twice in one week :)

The ingredients are amazing quality which can explain the little bit higher price of some dishes. On the pic you see the chili prawns. With my partner we took it twice - this is how good it was!

The other dish was green seafood curry, also full of flavor!

I would like to say big thank you for the people cooking: you made me love balinese cuisine!

The people working there are also super nice and humble.

This is the place to go, you’ll thank me later!","We went back two nights in a row as the food here was excellent, good portions, fairly priced, and served quite quickly. The ambiance was lovely, as it's located on a side street with nice decor, cooling fans, and even cloth napkins! Not an ant to be seen on our table.
The only dish in two nights that we found slightly disappointing was the black rice with coconut milk dessert, which tasted watery and bland compared to what we made during our cooking class in Ubud. The seared tuna was excellent, as were the soups and salads I tried. Red Curry chicken was maybe a bit sweet for our taste.
Overall, probably our second favorite restaurant in 1.5 weeks in Indonesia."

It’s absolutely delicious, the menu provides a lot of different dishes (each one even better than the other!) and the staff is really nice. Simply the best place if you want to eat a good amount of amazing food for a very cheap price","Hands down the best warung we’ve been to in Bali and Pemuteran. This place is a short walk from the Global Royal Pemuteran hotel we are lunch or dinner here most of our 5 days spent in Pemuteran. The food is clean and freshly made, which is why some dishes take longer to prepare than others, but it sure is worth the wait!

Among some of the dishes we’ve tried Nasi Campur, which is amazing. Their Padthai with prawns is heavenly and if you’re craving for some western style food the Special Sandwich is a delight, it caught me off-guard how good it was.

I would go back to Pemuteran for sure if only it was for this restaurant.

Slight downside is the noise from the street and all the cars/scooters passing by. But you can also order takeout if that bothers you.

Make sure to leave a tip for this special place and the amazing food that’s prepared by the kitchen staff and waiters/waitresses!"

The staff was very friendly and quick to greet and seat me. My drink and food order was brought out very quickly and actually separated in appetizer and main (which rarely happens in SE Asia).
The spring rolls and the dipping sauce were very good!
As a main I had grilled Mahi Mahi with vegetables and rice, it was cooked perfectly. Topped with a chili, garlic mixture that rounded it off great.
There was also nice music playing in the background. Not too loud, not too quiet.
I can highly recommend this Warung for a good meal and nice environment.","Very good warung. The food is very tasty, the dishes are excellent. Prices are almost half, compared to the restaurants by the coast. Highly recommend!","Thank you Wargung Sentai for your delicious authentic Bali food! Always served so well, with care for foreigner’s needs.

They have a beautiful garden! Thank you for sharing plants with us. 🙏🏽🌱","Cash only.

Food was average, the fish was not fresh.
Price is affordable.","Its a family owned place at the entrance of Tamansari Resort. It was the best among all the local warung's in Bali. They have special menu for lunch & dinner apart from other dishes, which is a excellent choice for food lovers and it has to order earlier so that they can make available the ingredients to serve. we've been there three times while staying at Tamansari, and we had really nice experience every time we visited there. They serves mouthwatering food with very nice hospitality."

The little road towards the resort is a bit difficult, but once there its just relaxing 🥰 you're right at the beach, there is snorkelling and diving available and with some luck you can see the little turtles in the hatchery!","Dear Resort Manager,

I am writing to express my satisfaction with my recent stay at your resort. I had a wonderful time enjoying the facilities, activities and services that you offer. The staff were friendly, helpful and professional. The room was clean, comfortable and spacious. The food was delicious, varied and well-presented. The views were breathtaking, especially from the pool and the beach.

I appreciate your attention to detail and your commitment to quality. You have exceeded my expectations and made my vacation memorable. I would highly recommend your resort to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable getaway.

Thank you for your hospitality and for providing me with such a good experience in your resort.

Sincerely,
Happy Guest",We had a fab time diving and snorkelling with Reef Seen. Gorgeous staff and very experienced dive master. We had a fabulous day trip to Menjangan island. Would highly recommend choosing Reef Seen.,"Amazing place! Chris the owner is such an inspiring and kind person. If you’re looking for a beautiful place right at the beach, where you can relax, snorkel and visit the turtle sanctuary you are at the right place :) looking forward to coming back!"

Great food and very fast service! Cap cay was best I ever had in Bali. Delicious pizza as well, stone baked. And I love the relaxing atmosphere, so much greenery!","Wow! A delicious surprise.  The atmosphere was tranquil as it is separated from the street by a stone wall and a fountain.  The service was very attentive. The bruschetta was great. The ranch pizza with olives and extra cheese was tasty and filling; the toppings were generous.  I am Italian and have eaten many pizzas... this one was great. It could have easily fed two hungry people. I had the recommended soda lemon grass (with sugar as recommended) it was refreshing and not too sweet. For dessert i tried the Dadar Gulung. A sweet treat without being overpowering.  I will be back tomorrow and may try their specials: chicken Alfredo,  Tomahawk porkchop, or seafood platter.  Come and try it, you will not be disappointed.","Wood oven pizza like in Italy! We went there twice and had totally different food and every time we were more than happy with our choices. Even our kids liked it there a lot, and they can be picky eaters sometimes.
Try the Rösti, they're definitely as good as in Switzerland 😀
Nice and friendly staff and a very beautiful garden.","I reviewed this restaurant once 9 months ago on my first trip to Bali. This time I didn't have pizza. The restaurant was empty and I am not sure if the pizza was fired up. The waitress steered to 3 dishes- penne pasta alfredo with chicken, Tomahawk pork chop or Seafood platter. I chose the Tomahawk pork chop with roasted potatoes and a avocado/shrimp salad as an appetizer. The avocado shrimp salad was swimming Balinese stripped down version of thousand island dressing. That is ketchup and mayonanaise. It is ubiquitous in Bali and I hate it. I can't understand the love affair with this horrible concoction. Even Mcdonald's secret has more flair. To add insult to injury, I calculated that there were 5-7 tables spooned added, coating the salad in a pinkish goo. The shrimp were shrimpishly small and probably frozen. The pork chop was very good. It was accompanied by a small salad with Balsamic vinegar dressing and hash browns. That was the first time I had hash browns being called roasted potatoes. The pork chop plate was good. The salad was bad. I suggested that they may want to ask if the customer would like the dressing on the side. The atomosphere was a nice as I remembered it. It is an inviting restaurant with a warm, casual vibe. I gave it 1 star less because of the salad dressing.","2 nights running I ordered their pizza and got it delivered to my hotel.

The pizza was excellent, the prices very fair. If you're in Pemuteran I would definitely recommend eating here.

The service was superb. I just WhatsApp the staff and the arranged my meal and delivery."

Friendly and helpful manager (Ms. Ria), Fantastic location, 100m from the main road, and 100m from main road direct to the beautiful Pemuteran Beach!!! 💙💙💙💙 easy access to local restaurant.
It was a really relaxing and refreshing break! Highly recommended to anyone wanting a getaway in Pemuteran, Bali.
We will absolutely go back in the future 🙌","Great room, cute landscape/ pool/ ambiance.  Very good customer service! AC worked well and was quiet.  Did was fantastic and reasonably priced.","The place is absolutely fantastic! The rooms are very spacious, with air conditioning, an outdoor shower and a large, comfortable bed. Cleanliness is impeccable! The swimming pool is also very pleasant and very well maintained.
The hotel restaurant also offers quality cuisine at a very reasonable price. Considering the price of the room, the value for money is absolutely unbeatable. The hotel team is always ready to listen and we were very well received. We loved our stay and will definitely be back.","Really loved our stay here. It’s in a beautiful secluded location with pretty landscaping, a pool, and on-site warung. The room was spacious and the AC worked great. The indoor/outdoor bathroom was also a fun feature, like being inside a cute little walled-in garden. We ended up staying for 9 nights and were sad to have to leave. One note for those afraid of dogs though - during our stay there was a pack of them that would hang out and guard the alley after sundown, barking at you as you were returning from town. It was a little disconcerting at first having them approach you in the dark until we realized from watching others go by that they were all bark and no bite. Not great, but otherwise everything here was awesome. For the value, it can’t be beat.","Very nice warung with local menu : fish and chips / pad Thai / ayam betutu / Tom yum / selada niçoise / tofu and tempe...
Stay there and chill in the pool for after lunch rest."

We are a party of large family. My husband and his family have stayed here in 2019. Pak Wayan accommodate us with sincere care and the best service. We are thankful for him and his family for welcoming us there once again.

The room is spacious, with a perfectly working AC, large bed, large mirror and decent-sized wardrobe. Each room got its own spacious outdoor shower and toilet which was very well taken care of. Their amenities include disposable small hotel soap bars, toilet paper, liquid soap, hot and cold shower, housekeeping services, free large parking space, and many more.

They have big garden with decent swimming pool. Perfect for family-friendly activities. Our children loved the garden since they can play and run freely on a green fluffy grass and shaded garden.

The establishment is about 10 minutes walking from a wonderfully calm beach. It has become our morning routine to visit the beach for a quick soak in the crystal clear water.

Overall, we had such a wonderful memories there. We'll come back again in the future."

We were a family of 4, from New Zealand and stayed here for 3 nights.
We were greeted with a welcoming lemon drink and Kadek checked us in (he made an effort to remember all our names). All staff were amazing.
We were able to check in early.
The Pool was great!!!!
Well kept grounds. We were offered to have our rooms cleaned every day. Great clean outside bathrooms. Awesome showers.
Concrete gym on site for the active relaxer, and the breakfast included was delicious. Fruit platter with a choice of egg dishes or pancakes.
The rooms and bed were very comfortable. We requested a fridge which was put in our room.
Kubu Pasi is a 2 min walk to the beach, access via a resort on the beach.
Down at the beach was great snorkelling as this beach has Bio Rock coral restoration project. A short walk from here was a Turtle sanctuary where we were able to release a baby turtle into the sea and follow it (with snorkel and mask) as it swam away.
Although there is no meals on site except breakfast (this is something they want to work on) there are two fantastic Warongs a short walk away, and also the local resort for western food.
We loved everything, snorkelled every day and really don’t want to leave this very affordable accommodation.",An oasis! A garden full of delights... including three cats. Lovely pool and chilled atmosphere. Hosts were very attentive and the owner took us for some local moonshine (!) and shared her experience of Pemuteran and Balinese culture. Great snorkelling just out front and diving to Menjangan island... Organised with ease.,"Of you are looking for a 5 star property you should look elsewhere. What it does have its awesome staff, great location, excellent pool, quiet and calming atmosphere.
Some rooms only have cold water showers but you get used to it quickly.
No on site restaurant but walk 100 m and Santai Warung is awesome.

We are foreigners living in Bali for a long time, in the southern area of ​​Canggu, where there is a lot of restaurant, but it is still difficult to find such a perfect restaurant like this Lakawi.

Thank you Lakawi for an excellent gastronomic experience, we will definitely come back here.🙏👍","Just tasty, simply tasty. I'm so happy to eat hamburger here. It's more expensive than local warungs and I basically eat at cheaper place but no regret to come here and the quality is clearly higher than the price. I already miss it. I wanna try all the hamburgers here.","Very good burger and wrap! Absolutely delicious. 🫠 one of the best restaurants in Pemuteran, i will definitely come back. Maybe tomorrow 😁 congrats!!🙏🏼","Ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Burger but it wasn't spicy at all... said it was meant to come with a Nashville Hot sauce but it came with something that tasted like pickle mayonnaise. Still tasted good but would like to have gotten the spice.

My partner got the Menjangan burger which looked really good and he liked it.

The fries were spot on 👌
