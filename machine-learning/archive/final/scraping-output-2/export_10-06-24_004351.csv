Besides that, there is a little coffee bar downstairs with incredible delicious and healthy snacks to enjoy the great view!","Are you in Ubud for Yoga?
There are many places to practice yoga in the area but ‚Ä¶ the best place to do Bikram (hot yoga) and any exercise in the heated room will be Ubud Yoga Centre. More over, they are probably the only yoga centre that has Asthanga classes that is open to all level with certified teacher/ instructor. Mysore is available.

The lounge/ cafe serves all the essential health conscious dishes and the boutique sells cute yoga related stuff. Yes, you can buy nice yoga attire here.","Such an AMAZING yoga center! It's STUNNING! The teachers are very knowledgeable, Jessica is my favorite ! The studio provides an array of classes. Upstairs host a massage area as well as delicious dining options. Clean, Beautiful and HOT!  The staff is SO friendly and welcoming.  I recommend this studio for all Yogis visiting Ubud as well as locals.  I can't say enough about this space. LOVE IT!","Came for the Yin yoga class, stayed for the food. Wonderfully relaxing and the instructor was very good.  Was able to put my large backpacking backpack behind the front desk during class because it was so massive. The food was delicious too.  I‚Äôd love to come back and try the other classes.","The Ubud Yoga Centre is not to be missed! The yoga facilities are magical, so calming and restorative. The staff, especially Komang (she is amazing!) is super friendly and attentive.  The cafe is wonderful too, I thoroughly enjoyed every meal I had there! I can‚Äôt think of a more ideal setting to practice yoga! üòä"

Beautiful trees, a gorgeous infinity pool overlooking the river, and lovely flowers are all around. The staff are wonderful and the rooms are spacious and modern. I recommend spending a little extra for one of the river view rooms, it‚Äôs worth it.","Good location next to Ubud Yoga Center and walking distance to the Nyuh Kuning neighborhood. But, you have to cross a very busy street on a curve. Our room had a fantastic poolside view, but many others did not. The sound of the river everyday was very relaxing.  There was an air-conditioning issue which took a long time to resolve and resulted in wet floors every morning. The breakfast was adequate but nothing special and the toast was never toasted enough, even though I requested it repeatedly. The play list in the restaurant was the same 3 Kenny G songs. Over and over and over. Another big disappointment was the reliability on plastic bottles. They should give each room a clean water jug dispenser. The manager, Widi, was very accommodating and did her best in arranging transport and guides. The shuttle to town was handy. We chose this hotel partly to be close to the yoga center and it was literally a 45 second walk, so extremely convenient if that is your interest.","We stayed for 3 nights at the Labak river hotel and had a great time. It was perfect for us as we were using it as a base to explore ubud. They sent us a driver to collect us from the airport and he was a great tour guide as we used him for a whole day of exploring at a very reasonable price. He proper looked after us. He also arranged other drivers for us when he was not available and they were very reliable.
The hotel was clean, the staff were attentive (booking us excursions and helped to remove a small lizard from our room one evening). Breakfast catered for most diets having international and local cuisine. If you are looking for a hotel to sunbathe and relax this would not be the place as the pool area is very small and did not get much sunlight, but is ideal for those exploring and is not too near the city centre to hear the traffic or get stuck in the traffic. We walked every day to the centre and it was fine. Overall 4 star.","Such a lovely, tranquil place to fully emerge in the Bali experience. Very relaxing and pleasant to stay in.","Hi everyone! I was there in 2020 to do my internship program. during my experience carrying out an internship here, I really know all parts of this hotel to all types of rooms, overall this hotel has very good rooms at very affordable prices with excellent facilities and comfort. all staff are very friendly to guests at the hotel. this hotel also has views of the Labak river which is very beautiful and green and this hotel room is located on the lowest floor so it is far from noise suitable for guests who like peace and quiet. This hotel has 2 restaurants, namely the Japanese restaurant and the main restaurant. it's just that the hotel facilities are not very complete, there is no gym and only has 1 sharing pool. I've stayed here one day during Nyepi, and was served like a guest hehe thank you "

Would highly highly recommend this place.","A very cozy and nice place to enjoy your day, perfect for those who look for some peaceful surroundings. The owner is very friendly and helpful and the food and coffee are great, with vegan options. I ordered their signature orange coffee, mushroom french fries, and cinnamon cake. The cinnamon cake is a must! Usually served with ice cream but sadly it‚Äôs currently sold out. Also tried their special brewed tea, a blend of chamomile + peppermint + white tea. Will definitely come back here:)",If you are looking for an underwhelming poorly constructed meal in a beautiful surroundings you've found the right place. Best to order a bottled water without a glass here.,"Absolutely love the vibe and the food. The cafe is cozy, the food and beverages taste great. They‚Äôre currently having promotion, with a min purchase of 75k worth of food you get free gym access (towel and a bottle of water included). They also run a lot of interesting events and workshop.

You can also find a sound healing studio within the compound. Perfect place for food, working remotely, and peaceful reading time.

We came especially to buy some coffee beans for our friends and got the chance to see how they use their special machines and tools, and they even specially roasted for us a specific blend we wanted to try that they didn't have in hand.

Keep in mind that many of the staff don't speak English so the communication was a bit harder, but the beans were worth it.","I was happy to find somewhere with a small selection of beans to choose from for v60, but unfortunately no light roast coffee. The beans available didn't have any information about taste profile etc which is helpful when decision making. So I had a smell of the options and chose one. It was ok coffee, but lacked depth, not much going on. My partner ordered a flat white and it was more like a latte, but the texture was good. They serve the coffee with some biscuits which is nice. My v60 was served with a sachet of brown sugar, which was strange for me, as filter coffee should never be paired with sugar. We got a pastry each and they were ok but nothing special. No chat from the barista about the coffee or anything. They have the roastery next door which is cool, it's a nice space to sit for a while but for me the coffee wasn't up to much.",They have their own roastary. The coffee is good. The always give biscuits and water as compliment. The price is super local friendly. Try their ice americano or v60 it was nice. If u wanna drink coffee in ubud just come here.,"Since my workplace was reassigned to Ubud, I had difficulties to a local coffee house that serves a consistent coffee taste until my friend recommended this one.

love so much with the houseblend since they owned the roastery too. A glass of Americano as always in my morning time before working. Not surprisingly if they had some regular customers including me in the meantime üòâ","""Hooked on coffee nostalgia""

Oh yes! You immediately feel like a character from a Salinger novel when you enter this cafe. The retro atmosphere is like a rift in time that your gaze falls into. Who wouldn't want to fall in love at first sight, especially with something as reasonable as good coffee at a reasonable price?

The ambiance of the place is so captivating that just a glance at the roasting machines and antique coffee grinders makes you feel like you've been transported to the past. The owner knows how to process the beans to create an unforgettable coffee experience. And yes, you can even buy coffee here! Amazing, isn't it?

If you are a true coffee connoisseur who appreciates coziness and low prices, this place will become your nirvana. It's a quiet refuge from tourist hustle and bustle. Thanks to some miracle, tourists have not yet destroyed this place. But for how long? Enjoy it while you still can!"

I would definitely recommend this place for people stay clam and relax and fun going out ubud","There were so many bugs!! Ants and gnats everywhere. There were bugs around when we first got there but the staff person sort of swept them out. However, the kitchen was still disgusting and within an hour all of the bugs were back. We weren‚Äôt able to find a new hotel for that night and I swept our two rooms multiple times attempting to keep the ants at bay. The staff that night did nothing and had no bug spray. The next morning the floor was covered in bugs, and there were bugs in the beds. It was honestly the most disgusting thing I‚Äôve ever seen. There was a new staff person who came and thoroughly swept the rooms. We left that day rather than spending a second night, and the staff was unsurprised- they were aware of the bug issues but didn‚Äôt seem to care enough to do anything about it, just said that the bugs tend to show up in the afternoon and night. Do not stay here! Plus the bathrooms smell and are moldy and it‚Äôs so far from everything. Honestly it kind of felt like the whole hotel was a scam."

We are currently 3 weeks into an 8 week contract. Despite expressing the importance of reliable internet for work, we encountered persistent issues with the WiFi, and our concerns were not addressed adequately.

From the beginning, we faced difficulties with the internet connection, which significantly impacted our ability to carry out our professional responsibilities. Despite bringing this to Fiona's attention on multiple occasions, no effective solutions were provided, and the issue persisted throughout our stay.

Moreover, instead of acknowledging and addressing the problem, Fiona chose to deflect blame onto us, making it clear that she was unwilling to take responsibility for the inadequate service provided. This lack of accountability is disheartening and unprofessional.

In an attempt to resolve the situation independently, we have resorted to purchasing our own routers to ensure a stable internet connection, which should not have been necessary in a well-maintained rental property.

Additionally, attempts to seek a refund for the subpar service and remaining month of rent inorder to relocate were met with resistance and further frustration. It is regrettable that our reasonable requests for a resolution were not met, leaving us with no choice but to share our experience here.

I would advise potential renters to carefully consider their options before choosing Villa Ishtar, especially if a reliable internet connection is essential for your stay.","Stayed with my family for 3 nights. It's a lovely place to stay with nice forest view. The space is much larger than the pictures. The kitchen is well equiped. Fiona and Tya were extremely prompt and helpful to us. All rooms had air conditioners and a nice little stream flows at the back of the villa. The only minor downside was extremely loud fans, though the air-conditioning is very effective and as such fans were not required. Recommend having own vehicle when staying here since Ubud is about 15-20 minutes away and not within walking distance.","I really enjoyed my stay at Villa Ishtar! It‚Äôs such an experience, when I walked in I was very impressed by the design, everything just looks beautiful and carefully thought after, a real pleasure to be in a space with so much art, antique features and modern furniture. Everything is very new and extremely clean, Tya was very friendly and extremely good, she made me and my daughter feel so comfortable abd at home there!!!
The jungle and river are very serene, you feel really surrounded by nature and isolated while being in Ubud and so close to all the restaurants and sightseeing. You can really feel very relaxed and at peace there. Swimming in the pool with a jungle view was a treat.
I‚Äôm a very light sleeper and can never sleep long but the beds were so  comfortable with amazing mattresses and very high quality bed linen that I have slept for 11 hours straight. It‚Äôs very quiet all the time there so it‚Äôs a right place to chill.
The roof top has a comfy gazebo and a great sunset view, I‚Äôve overslept the sunrise but believe the sunrise view with all the volcanoes and endless rice fields around would be fantastic too!
The kitchen is very well equipped with everything you need.
My daughter really enjoyed feeding the fishes too!
Would definitely come and stay there again, a real gem of a villa!","Beautiful space with an amazing jungle view! Made me feel like I‚Äôm in the middle of nowhere, away from the hustle and bustle of the world!
The location is really great! Close to the restaurants and cafes and we were able to enjoy go-jek‚Äôs delivered food on the last nights of staying in.

The place is well designed and beautifully furnished. Clean with a friendly staff,
Over all - really loved it! 6 starts out of 5","This is not your average house!! I really enjoyed everything about this stay. The location, the rice field AND jungle views, the art in the house and the spacious layout. It was the perfect mix of city design set in the middle of nature.

My boyfriend and I stayed for 9 nights, and we have no complaints, everything was perfect. it's a bit further away from the center, so it's more relaxed and you can have a glimpse of a day in the balinese life. at the same time, it's not that far from the center, so you have all the structure you need for enjoying the holidays. the main pros are:
- bed & pillows were super comfy;
- room had fridge, AC, mosquito-killer, and great wi-fi;
- private bathroom, with towels and soap provided;
- small kitchen (2 pans, kettle, basic utensils, 1 gas stove burner, sink), perfect for cooking up some breakfast;
- frequent housekeeping (almost everyday) to make bed and sweep the floor;
- near local warungs (Lingga Sedana was my favorite, and it was literally the house nextdoor; Minang Vegan, Warung Sate Madura ""dua putri""), cheap laundry service ($7k per kilo), coffee shops (Jaya Coffee Roasters), Coco Market (10min by foot), and massage (Putu's);
- very friendly family, specially the lady who always said ""HELLOOO!"" with a big smile :)
- Ubud center is 10min away by scooter. I dont drive, so I used Grab (~15k one way, around US$1) and it worked perfectly - drivers usually went through the Monkey Forest, which was super fun! if you drive, Artawa can rent you a scooter.","+ Very nice place, quiet and peaceful.
The owner and his family are super friendly and helpful, they helped us every time we needed and let us participate to the cerimony together with the hole family.
The room has everything you need to spend good holiday and the price you pay for it is really good.
- It is a little bit far from the center but renting a motorbike is perfect if you want to exit from the noises.
The room was really humid but probably because of the rainy season.","Very clean dormitory. You got your own bothy where are toilet and shower, very nice place.
But it‚Äôs far away from town. By walking it‚Äôs about 30 min to town, but you can borrow a motorbike.
And there‚Äôs no WiFi.","Nice place to stay, but quite far out of town. There no gojek in and around Ubud so you'll either have to use overpriced Taxis or walk. Beside that it's a good place to stay :)",the place is cool.. and the owner is so kind too.. if you want to visit in ubud this is good place to stay. best luck to the next travelers. you will appreciate the place.. amazing place with amazing and hospitable people too..
