There were many tour groups completing the purification ritual, but we just walked around to see the pools and koi. Very tranquil and serene. There is a small entrance fee but is totally worth it!","Nice temple, had a lot of visitors, you can move quickly in and out, the entrance fee includes renting a sarong that everyone is required to wear.

I could recommend booking a professional meditation tour before hand so you can do some meditation and guided shower here.

Very positive and peaceful ambiance overall.",Gunung Kawi Sebatu Temple. It is located north of the Tegalalang Rice Terrace.. about 10 minutes.. the view is beautiful. Specially we can also clean ourselves.. namely bathing in holy water..,"It is the second time I have visited this place. It is not very busy, not too many tourists, no aggressive sellers (they are on the other side of the street beckoning you to come). You can actually relax there and contemplate the surroundings. The place is not large so don't expect the spectacular architecture. I think this one is better (more spiritual) than Tirta Empul if you actually want to do the ritual purification.","One of the most beautiful and peaceful temples we visited. I recommend going early in the morning, the light is magical and you will avoid the crowds."

The rooms are very big and very good equipped. The only minus is there is a humidity smell inside and the rooms are not cleaned properly. They should put a little bit more pressure on that. One day they forgot to clean our room too. In total it was a very pleasant stay and we would for sure come back! üíö,"This place could have been great. But you can tell its glory days are in the past.
We got a ‚Äúprivate villa‚Äù and this was what we experienced:
The rooms and bathroom were huge. So that was nice.
But you can tell it used to be an open air bathroom that got boarded up. When it rains it pours‚Ä¶ IN THE BATHROOM. There was a waterfall between the toilet and the shower (not on purpose) because when you look up there‚Äôs wooden boards attempting to cover the ceiling you can tell there‚Äôs mold everywhere behind these walls. Then all the floors and toilet and everything is sopping wet.

Our private pool that I was so excited about  was not private. Anyone in the community pool could see right into our villa pool area. And the water was freezing! So unfortunately we didn‚Äôt use the pool we upgraded to.","I'm compelled to commend the exceptional service provided during my recent stay. From check-in to check-out, your staff exemplified the pinnacle of hospitality.

Across all departments, the cordiality and supportiveness were palpable, elevating my experience beyond expectations. Each interaction, whether at reception or in the restaurant, was characterized by professionalism and genuine care.

Furthermore, the ambiance and amenities surpassed what I've encountered elsewhere, creating a truly memorable stay.

In short, Puri Gangga sets a new standard in hospitality, thanks to your remarkable team. I eagerly anticipate my next visit.","We stayed at Puri Gangga Resort for 4 nights and the experience was absolutely stunning. We stayed in the Godavari suite which is one of the suites with a private pool. Definitely get a private pool suite if you can. The view from these suites are beautiful. We stayed in the midst of nature in a very private and spacious room. The environment was so extremely peaceful. The pool was a little cold but if you like pools, you know it just takes a few minutes to get used to and then it‚Äôs perfect. The restroom is open concept with skylights over the bathtub and the rainfall shower ‚Äì everything about this room was breathtaking, especially considering the price in CAD.

During our stay we got airport transfer, a  floating breakfast, a candle light dinner in the beautiful porch of our villa, a full day tour, and a drop off to our next hotel directly from the end of the tour. Throughout all of this, the staff were extremely friendly, kind, and attentive. Every time you walk by the lobby the staff will ask where you‚Äôre going and if you need anything to ensure you‚Äôre comfortable during your outing. One of the main drivers there, Jo, was extremely helpful and just the best tour guide you could ever have. We saw him in the resort throughout our trip and he always had answers to all our questions about where we wanted to go, and the best and safest way to get there. It felt like Jo was our personal guide during our stay here. Our interactions with the staff and especially Jo really took our experience here to the next level.

The candle light dinner was very romantic. Full dinner service to your room as if you‚Äôre at a top-notch restaurant. Options include tradition Balinese food as well as western food (steak, fries, etc.). In my personal opinion, Balinese food is very tasty and you should stick to the Balinese food at this resort.

Our full day tour was awesome. Jo was able to figure out an itinerary based on a few things we wanted to see, time out a lunch break, and get us back in time for dinner at the hotel‚Äôs beautiful restaurant.

The village we stayed in is known for wood carving. We walked out from the resort and into the village, checked out some of the local stores, grabbed some souvenirs, coffee, and some fruit shakes. Everything felt very safe. The locals here are very friendly.

On our last day, Jo dropped us off for another tour after checking out. During this tour he made sure we were okay and ensured we got connected with a ride to our next hotel, and confirmed we made it there safely. The customer service at this resort is just unmatched!!!!","I was presently surprised when we reached the hotel. When we have booked the hotel seeing the images we thought we made a good choice. But the moment we entered the Resort we were mesmerized with the Ambience, Feel, Green Cover, Rooms, Infinity Pool... It was absolutely stunning and we thoroughly enjoyed the Stay. The food prepared by the Chef was so good we decided to spend our anniversary night in the resort itself.

Had a great time. Wish we have booked this for our complete stay."

You also have a restaurant with delicous italian and indonesian food.
We‚Äôre definitely coming back again next time.","*One Star*
this was my real experience in your resort, after 20 years in Bali I had never been treated so rudely by the staff.  I advise you to improve your education.

I had a terrible experience at this hotel near Ubud. The staff was incredibly rude throughout my arrival. The pool is ridiculously small. To make matters worse, they demanded an outrageous fee for an extra bed for my kid, more than half the price of the room itself! I would not recommend this place to anyone.","Suarapura is a real treasure located right in the middle of the jungle and rice fields. Beautiful, quiet place with excellent, gentle service. Definitely the best location we have been to in Bali so far. During our stay we felt very well taken care of. There is delicious, simple cuisine in the restaurant, the restaurant staff is very friendly and attentive.
Thank you for your kindness, we hope to be back one day!","Visited this place for their restaurant, looking for dinner nearby.
It's like finding a gem in this area, it's a mixed of indonesian cuisine and italian dishes, run by italian family who have lived in Bali for 35 years, it was great meeting Sebastiano and his staffs , they are all very friendly.
Definitely will recommend for friends who are looking for peaceful resort with great food and view. it's peaceful and very relaxing here."

Service: not too good, only 1 person doing multiple jobs, no phone only whatsapp.
Can ask for airdryer. No toothbrush and toothpaste.

I did get a room with non working AC, and complained several minutes about it, the staff eventually changed our room..

The villa area are well landscaped, 2 pools, nice paddy fields, lots of vegetation,","The place is beautiful! Surrounded by rice field and peaceful ambiance, this villa also has swimming pool and luscious landscape.

The room was quite homey, but it will be greater if the staff can improve its cleanliness. They are friendly but when i checked out the staff is not available on the place.",We stayed here for 3 nights. It was a great experience. The service is great with many helpful and friendly staff around. The pool area is very nice and offering a great ambience to relax or take a swim. Would have stayed longer and would stay here again when in Ubud.,"I absolutely loved my stay in here. Stayed there for 3days recently at the time of posting this review.

A lovely place that is closed to the nature, and right smack in the padi field. The weather was very comfortable and cooling, average about 23 degree Celsius. In the quiet night, you can hear the song of insects; the sound of various insects. People are really helpful and friendly. We, a family of four, stayed here for 4 nights in a family suite with 2-bedroom. It is a two-villa that is an adjoining unit with a sizable balcony which is good. Both our teenaged kids enjoyed their stay too. Pockets of the staff can speak English very well. Special thank you to Yuika who has been very responsive and helpful; and Bayu who has been very helpful also. And thanks to Cha Cha too - friendly and helpful.

Cultural performance is worth the  mention. This property surely has put a lot of effort in making their guests feel at home and bringing Balinese culture to the guest. The cultural of 5 dances comes with a full-course dinner (paired with a glass of wine)for a reasonable price of IDR300K per pax. There is selection of western styled and indonesian cooking to choose from.

our experiences in the room and it‚Äôs services:
*they were very responsive to cleaning the floor as there‚Äôs shoe marks are seen, and was a bit dusty
*they were very efficient in providing additional two pillows as only two pillows was available when we checked in.
*the bed and mattress was good!
*loved the construction of room with matured woods throughout, wished it were maintained well as some of part the wall has holes, some of the wood areas are infected with ants.
*all furnitures are made of matured woods too, very nicely done and authentic, just that it needed some up-keeping: some of drawer‚Äôs handles are not working, opening of the cupboard‚Äôs door are not functioning properly.
*as this place is surrounded by nature, please do expect various kinds insects as part of the whole setting üòá

The following are also provided for:
*towel - one bath towel for each person
*drinking water - 2 x bottled water 500ml for each room per day
*safe box, TV, hairdryer, kettle, instant coffee
*toileteries: toothbrush with toothpaste, shower cap, soap bar, shampoo, body wash, cotton bud - wished that is uses the one with paper shaft instead of plastic
*wifi - not the best, intermittently not working but it was alright, this way we have more time to feel the presence of the nature.

Overall experience:
*people are very helpful, responsive, and accommodating.
Breakfast was alright, the usual standard set in most hotel in Bali: a selection of american breakfast, or Indonesian styled. The food at it‚Äôs restaurant was delicious. Loved the grilled snapper. Soto ayam and bebek betutu (a local dish of duck meat) was equally good.","They are expanding the capacity of villas from 6 to more. I stayed for 2 nights here, You can fill the peace in the air with greenary all around, they provide the free tour to near by areas as activity which was good. Swimming pool is not that good as you don't get the privacy here nor the pool is infinity one.","Beautiful countryside  location amongst the rice fields and away from hustle and bustle of Ubud. Staff are super helpful and friendly. The dining area is a raised open sided platform with great views and the food is good, especially banana pancakes!","Worst experience. Remote location. Everything is just not right. Breakfast is big problem. Extremely limited breakfast. Staff blatantly refuses to give more breakfast even though you are not wasting food.
We had private pool villa, however, private pool is just there where everyone walks, so no privacy at all. Ants and spiders stay with you in your room. Temple near by which uses announcer to announce all the time.
Pricey but services are just below 3 star hotel. Never going back.",We were looking for a short escape to the nature and this is perfect! Tucked in the north of Ubud surrounded by rice fields. Room itself very spacious and modern. We will go back and definitely going to recommend this place to our friends and family

A local friend told us that the cost per person would be around 35,000 RP (she saw our food). However, the restaurant ended up charged us 100,000 RP in total which I believe is at a very high price range compared to other local restaurants. (At another restaurant nearby we had nasi campur for 15,000 RP each.) Nonetheless, the food and the view were enjoyable.","This place is very famous for Baby Guling. Today is was ""officially"" not the right day but we still got Nasi Campur (rise with mixed stuff) but still based on pork meat. It was one of the best we ever had in Bali.

The food is absolutely gorgeous, and also the drinks are great! We had the vanilla punch, and the sirsak juice which was unbelievable good! For lunch we had the spicy traditional fish and the stir fried prawns which both came with very good sauce. Very delicious!

We will definetly come back to this hidden gem!!! Thanks to the very friendly staff!","The food was excellent. I ordered about four different things. I ordered the tuna steak, the sesame chicken, banana fritter, fritter, crispy mujair, and ice lemongrass ginger tea.

A few things to call out. From an American standpoint, that sesame chicken will not be what you think it is. It is more of a cordon bleu type of plate.

The tuna steak was probably my least favorite. Was still good. I asked for medium rare, and it was almost nearly fully cooked. I should also assume any place not near the water is not gonna have the best seafood. And this particular situation it was the case. If you want seafood, I would definitely recommend eating in seminyak.

The ice ginger lemongrass tea was delicious. It was very refreshing.

The banana fritter was covered in the same crust that you would see on the sesame chicken meal. It was good and a good size portion after already eating three other meals lol.

The crispy mujair was probably my favorite. The sauce was very delicious mixed with the fish and the white rice. I wish the fish was bigger but that‚Äôs coming from a westernized mindset of portion sizes lol.

They do have these two stray dogs that seem to be fed by gas. They are very friendly, but just something to keep a lookout for.

The views were very relaxing as you can see in my pictures were overlooking the pool into the massage and grass area.

Be mindful that, depending on which road you come up to the place, your car won‚Äôt be able to go down that road. You will need to be on a scooter to be able to go up that specific road or walkable.

I would also say the pricing for the food was very reasonable. The cost of my meal was so much just because I tried a few different items.","There's a terrace overlooking the jungle below. The view is absolutely gorgeous and food delicious. The staff is also very friendly and speaks very good English. We ordered two ice coffees, two juices, two main dishes (squid and fish) with additional rice, and two fruit fritters. Paid around 230k for everything. It's truly a bargain.

If you're staying somewhere around, you can't skip this place.",Great spot to chill and eat after a spiritual experience.,"We were staying in the villa about 5 min drive. You have very limited options in this region of Bali. Food rather overpriced ( due to no competition), or just not tasty.
This place was nice !
Mi goreng ( 25 000)was tasty, with enough sauce and spice.

The outdoor seating is nice as well with a look on the rice fields.","Really nice place that just opened yesterday!  We saw the sign while biking by and stopped in for lunch. The food was great and so was the setting.
It is in the middle of a rice field. Great service also. You can tell a lot of thought went into the decor of the space.
The staff kindly greeted us and sat us down.
Their chocolate croissant was flaky, crispy, and one of the best croissants ever.(We've had a lot of croissants.)The dragon fruit smoothie bowl was huge and delicious. The spring roll was also excellent.","Great restaurant, menu is very good, lots of options, and moktails and Bali brewed Kura Kura very nice. Very friendly owners and highly recommended.","Such a beautiful, sweet and nice place! We enjoyed it here very much and the coffee was so great! Vegan options for milk etc. available.
