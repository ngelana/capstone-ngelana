So beautiful and aesthetic. We had a wonderful time in the king suite, it was very spacious and peaceful. There is plenty of sunlight that comes in and places to snap some photos.
Thank you very much Hotel Sages and we look forward to staying there again next time!","Sages Hotel offers a villa-like experience with 9 rooms of various sizes, views, and rates. The Mediterranean decor creates a Santorini-like ambiance, making it a charming choice for a secluded sanctuary. However, it's important to note that there's no parking area, and the hotel is quite far from busy areas and stores. Some rooms may have issues with moist walls, which might be a concern. Overall, while it's a nice place, some improvements could be made, especially considering the price. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê","I recently stayed at King Suite, and it was an absolute delight. However, consider carefully if you want full privacy when choosing this room type.‚Ä®‚Ä®The design and decor had a beautiful blend of modern elements and traditional Balinese touches, creating a serene ambiance with instagrammable corners.

The hotel's pool area was a highlight, providing a great spot for relaxation and sunbathing. If you don‚Äôt like the sun, there is also a poolside rest area.

The staff was helpful in accommodating with the requests I had.

The location was also convenient, less than 20 minutes by car to the Canggu area with trendy cafes and restaurants.

Overall, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a short relaxation stay. Bear in mind it‚Äôs not a full-fledged hotel, rather it's an Airbnb. So don‚Äôt expect a variety of breakfast choices, activities and amenities.","I really enjoyed my stay here in Sage Hotel. I joined the retreat and it was such a relaxing yet adventurous experience. The hotel itself is a little paradise on its own. Greeted by nice hospitable hotel staffs with a pool that is so inviting for its guests. I stayed in the main room on the second floor and it got an amazing view that captured the sunset.
This Sage Retreat offers a vegan food dish selection, yoga class, and an adventure day out together with fellow quests. We went to this breathtaking waterfall and it was one of the highlights of such a delightful mini trip with Sage Retreat.
I highly recommend this retreat for those solo travelers out there such as myself.","While the hotel is beautiful and I loved the pool area, it's not focused on function or the guest experience at all.

I do not recommend staying in Room 2 as it has floor to ceiling windows and only a semi-sheer curtain. At night time it was really bright - I had all of the light from the lobby and Room 5 shining in my room which made it difficult to sleep. My shower often didn't work, and there's also no water in the rooms, tissues, tea making facilities, and you have to ask the staff for a pool towel each day."

I had booked for three days, but I can only handle one night. The room has a bad smell and the bathroom is also unpleasant.

I regret not checking the reviews beforehand since it was a last-minute decision.","I've never written a bad review before.. but this is outrageous and I'm writing this furiously this morning being woken up by my neighbor's alarm for 40 straight minutes

the walls between the rooms are very thin, you will hear your neighbors whispering. floors that creak every time you walk even the squeaks of your neighbors can be heard

there is no receptionist on duty at 6am (i searched for 20 minutes and was not there) so you can't complain about this problem

better loking other place if you want some peace","Staying here is terrible!  In the room, rats ran along the beam on the ceiling, incomprehensible worms fall on the bed, or what is it?  Behind the fence they constantly play billiards until 2-3 o'clock in the morning, the windows do not close with a lock, your things are not safe, the board on the porch broke under your foot, everything is old.  The staff is not polite, except for one girl.  The air conditioner is brought straight to your shower room, there are no windows in this place, you can boil yourself alive there.  Their photos do not match the quality!  In reality, everything is not so colorful and cozy.  We were allowed to use the kitchen, the girl tried to be polite, they gave us a night light on request and this is the only thing I can note in a few days, We paid in advance, we were looking for another accommodation and so we wanted to leave as soon as possible.. do not ruin your life, stay somewhere else","This place is the worst place I have ever stayed in for budget travel.

Woken up at 330am to the noise of neighbors who didn‚Äôt care that people are sleeping. Security tried to help but that didn‚Äôt stop them.

Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else. The owner obviously doesn‚Äôt care.","it's a humble old cottages compound, since the main corridor made of wood (with low maintenance) not suitable for children."
