Luckily though that means not many people and we had the whole area to ourselves. Really powerful and large waterfall surrounded by luscious bright green forest. Entry was 20k and well worth it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this for a family or anybody with issues with stairs.,"Be prepared for a trek to this waterfall, road down and lots of stairs, meaning you have to do lots of climbing back up, which is a pain. But so worth it as this is a gorgeous little waterfall. Fortunately I had it all to myself as there were no other tourists there. You can see a beautiful rainbow at the bottom of the waterfall at the right angle. Really recommend making your way over here and just enjoying the sounds of the nature :)","The second highest waterfall in Bali, Indonesia, extraordinarily beautiful and neatly arranged, prepare good conditions, quite good to be able to arrive at this waterfall","beautiful waterfall, very high.  the road to it is insanely long, down the steps.  if you are not a sports person, then it will be difficult for you to go down and up.  given that there are two more waterfalls in this area, I would not go here, because the road is too long, and the waterfall is ordinary.  entrance 20.000 rupees, as elsewhere.","Far away and long-distance, take care of yourself and be careful, when you go there, The road to go there is a dangerous as the stairs to go down, but there will be a lot of peace and relax when you get there."

The staff is beyond nice, welcoming.
The restaurant is also pretty good.
The room are very nice.
Only drawback : we were not accustomed to spring matress and thus leave the hotel with back pain.","The rooms are very basic, but the view from the room we had is fantastic. We were a bit disappointed in the restaurant, it's better to go out and eat in the nearby village (walking distance).

From the hotel it's possible to walk to some really nice waterfalls.","Romantic, nostalgic place in the center of Munduk‚Ä¶ nice walking paths all around it. Spice forest. They have beautiful yoga shala, and a feeling of history when traveling to Bali was something few could do.","Very special place to stay in a original Lumbung (communal rice staking hut) amidst rice fields and beautifully designed gardens. With deity statues and lotus ponds all around. Good starting point for waterfall trekking from hotel grounds. Living with nature the Balinese way. Big black ants crawling on balcony. All they were busy with was clearing a death moth. After moth gone, ants gone too. üíö","We had a lovely time at Puri Lumbung Cottages. Everyone was so friendly. We were invited to join the stuff during the Ogoh Ogoh parade and we were able to see ceremonies and offerings on silent day. In the morning at 2 after Nyepi, the stuff made some food in front of the hotel area and we were invvited to join. We felt very welcome. Thank you for your hospitality.

The cottages are lovely and the view from the balcony is amazing. Unfortunately, the weather was very bad and we couldn‚Äòt see the waterfalls and temples nearby."

Good location, many beautiful waterfalls nearby üëåüèºin short walking distance.
The restaurant is really pricy compared to the other ones near by.
The breakfast buffet is nothing special.
But the staff is really friendly.","I came here for dinner and I was so disappointed with the food and drinks quality as well as the staff. I ordered  the tuna, which was completely raw in the middle, and smelled off. I  asked the staff to take the meal away because it was rotten. The strawberry drink üç∏ I ordered was also terrible. The strawberries were rotten. When I got the bills, they tried to charge me full price for everything despite sending my meal back without eating it. I was also charged an extra credit card fee even though I paid with cash. Avoid this place at all costs. Everything about it was bad.","It was amazing staying there for 3 nights. They surprised me with birthday cake at diner time and pancake at breakfast time.
All staff members are friendly, room was huge, I can see mountain from my room it was amazing. I wish I could stay bit longer there. Never skip infinity pool for a day :)
Thank you üôè",I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights with my friends. We got a family suit with 2 seperate rooms. The rooms were clean and have a welcoming atmosphere. The personal was very friendly and the room service was quick and reliable. The location of the hotel is great and exactly what we were looking for. It is very humid up here and the roads are quite small to get here. But the view and surrounding area are definetly worth the trip.

Especially the me goreng and the corn fritters were absolutely insane!",Best Nasi goreng and lumpia we have had yet. Easy to find and stunning views. The restaurant supports women workers in the area.,"What a fantastic find. Coffee great. Spring rolls fantastic. So good, we went twice in two days.","Best cafe in Bali by far!! (My opinion)

If you like rustic, tucked away nestled in the mountains of Munduk and a scooter adventure to appreciate and support a business that supplies only local produce direct from the farmers this is the place! The business is Fair trade accredited with %100 of the income going to the co-operative.

We were lucky enough to meet the owner ‚ÄòBudi‚Äô while he was at the cafe serving in between running another business and he was kind enough to teach us about Luwak coffee and gave us a wonderful insight about Balinese culture.

If you are luck you will also see monkeys on the trip up!

We have the worst lunch in Bali, I‚Äôm not even sure how old were the food.. with ants and mosquitos, really dry and tough.
We came to the rooms and the towels where smelly, the bed sheets where still wet, side tables light doesn‚Äôt work, bathroom with weird distribution and smell.
Wifi is really bad 0-4mb speed.

The only thing that i liked was the view from the balcony, but is like every other place in here. So I wouldn‚Äôt recommend at all this place.

The picture that I uploaded is not with all the ants and mosquitoes that i take from that particular plate, sadly I couldn‚Äôt take more from all the plates.",I‚Äôve been coming to Munduk for 30 years and to Puri Alam for about 15 years. If you appreciate beauty then this place is one of the best accommodations in probably the most beautiful part of Bali. When you wake you should get the view - if it‚Äôs clear - of the three dormant volcanos. You can climb them also if you have the time. The area has lots of hikes. You could easily spend a week here. Though a warning. It‚Äôs probably also the wettest parts of Bali,"The air of fading grandeur only adds to the charm of this delightful hotel. Perched on a ridge just above ‚Äòcentral Munduk‚Äô (actually just a row of shops), it has gorgeous views across the valley to the sacred peak of Gunung Batukau. Rooms 2 and 4 were real classy though I‚Äôm told not all the rooms are up to the same standard, so best check first. They take credit cards: pretty useful as there is no ATM or bureau de change in Munduk. The pool is a bit old and the breakfast uninspiring but the prices and the vibes are just right.","The view is beautiful here, and the service is great. But for travelers who brings your own car, I don't think it's recommended because the parking lot is so small, only 2 car fits, and the location is near the highway so you can't park your car outside the hotel. For muslim travelers, be careful when choosing food because they serve pork fried rice, so I don't think it's halal here. Maybe you can buy pop mie/other instant food on the way here.","The hotel itself looked very good, there was a swimming pool with a nice view, although it was a bit small for a hotel that size. The WiFi signal was a little weak, and didn't work at all times. I would recommend looking for other restaurants for dinner."

We got the ribs and a pizza. The pizza had a bit of a frozen pizza quality and the ribs were rather chewy. It did the job and filled us up but I wouldn‚Äôt eat here again","The food was great, and the view is very beautiful. Yes the place is a bit pricy compared to the area, but the food quality is also miles ahead. The pizza was the best pizza I had in Bali by far. The burger was very delicious. The capacino is perfect. My wife's molten lava cake was amazing. My frozen teramsu was meh. Overall, the food is the best I have tried in the area, and would absolutely recommend it.","Very nice staff. Service is great. Good is delicious, for a good price! We were so hungry, so we only wished the portions were a bit bigger. But everything else was perfect!
Update: All three of us concluded this was the best pizza we ever had in Bali (and we eat pizza pretty often) The crust, the taste, the cheese, not too thick not too thin, perfect, just a little small haha)","Referring to this place as a pizzeria is selling it short.  Yes, they have pizzas on the menu but they offer so much more.  My wife had the saltimbocca and it was very good.  I had a local pork dish that was equally as good.  But just as importantly, this place is gorgeous.  We went in the evening so we could not see the view but the architecture and surrounding grounds are beautiful.",Beautiful Restaurant with great service and delicious balinese food.

The instructors were passionate and knowledgeable, making the complex world of cooking accessible and fun.

The hands-on experience, coupled with the warm and welcoming atmosphere, made this class a highlight of my trip. Highly recommend to anyone looking to expand their cooking skills in a friendly and supportive environment!","What a fantastic experience, we were collected from our hotel and taken around the market to buy the last few ingredients needed for our class and to try fruits and foods that we are not familiar with. Our wonderful hosts purchased things we were interested in and explained what they were before we were able to try them. From the market we were taken to their family home where we prepared 6 courses all from fresh ingredients and traditional cooking methods such as using a pestle and mortar rather than a blender. All of the courses were absolutely delicious and there was plenty to enjoy afterwards. Being a group of 5 adults we were all stuffed by the time we finished the pudding. This lovely couple were so attentive through the experience and genuinely kind. They drove us back to our hotel after the course. I couldn‚Äôt recommend this more, an evening wonderfully spent!","We had a lovely day with Nyoman and her family. We went to the local market to get all ingredients for our vegetarian meal. She picked us up from our hotel.
Then we prepared our lunch at her house. The food was delicious and she prepared everything with a lot of love. She also has a small shop at home, where you can buy local products. We can highly recommend her cooking class. Thank you so much for a lovely day with you!","We had such a great time at Arta Shop Cooking Class. Nyoman and her husband were so lovely, and gave great education about Balinese traditions and food. They picked us up from our accommodation in Munduk, making it very easy for us.
The market visit was a great way to see the everyday life of the people of Munduk. It was clear to see how passionate Nyoman is about cooking and sharing the Balinese traditions to us. This was the best Balinese food we have had!
Highly recommend this experience.
Thank you Nyoman for a wonderful time","Had an amazing experience coming to this cooking class!!! My husband and I had an incredible time visiting the market with Nyoman as she explained different ingredients and customs. On the journey back from the market she would point out trees where local foods were sourced from as we passed by (including cloves which I never realised how they grew), and during the cooking demonstration she explained every detail of what we were doing and waited patiently as we filmed each part (so we could easily watch at home and replicate).

Also they are an incredibly lovely family - her husband is so kind and her two sons are very sweet (who came in to say hello quickly as they finished school).

We felt so welcome in their home and we will love to visit again the next time we are in Munduk."
