The atmosphere is a bit more energetic when there's a live show. I found it very suitable for anyone looking for a place to eat, drink, or just have fun because it's frequented by foreigners, and there are people in the same vibe looking to share with others.
Overall, my experiences at this place have been very good, and I would definitely come back if I visit the island again.","after having a terrible lunch at Warung Beach restaurant, we were very afraid to try out this place just next to it

Plus I had bookmarked this place for their Octopus

I spoke to their staff first and she seemed to have a good idea on how the octopus is prepared and that i will probably like it
we took the risk and ordered the same along with spaghetti

Food was great!!!

My first octopus experience was fantastic.. lovely creature to have on a dinner plate
Staff and the atmosphere is lovely plus live music.. this place is a great option for dinner and clearly in the top 2 in our Penida trip

Impressed by the friendly, competent service, and the food was great. Several nights of live music too. Latin night on Thursday, and music on Friday nights too were popular and fun. Highly recommended Penida Colada if you find yourself on Nusa Penida.","Very lovely vibes, great live music, kind staff. 3 dips apetizer seemed a little bit too simple and small for 80k dish.

The ambiance is elevated by the thoughtful lighting that creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, making every moment spent here truly magical.

The highlight, however, has to be the authentic Indonesian cuisine that tantalizes the taste buds with its rich flavors and perfectly balanced spices.

Every dish we tried was a delightful journey into traditional Indonesian culinary excellence.

Lava cake desert was just sensational and since we tried it we got addicted and kept on returning for more. We also had our Christmas dinner here and food was just great.

I went several mornings during my stay in Nusa Penida, always good, very nice environment, friendly staff, fair prices.

Shrimp crackers might appear, we asked because we were confused and they confirmed it was shrimp. If you don‚Äôt eat animals, and don‚Äôt want to see dead sea animals on your plate, please ask them about shrimp crackers before placing your order! Not the first place on Nusa Penida, many people think shrimp crackers are vegetarian. Killing ocean animals is NOT vegetarian. Lucky a friend was happy to take and eat the shrimp crackers. Photos are: tofu wrap and vege mee goreng! 100% rate the 2 chilli spicy level! If you love Nepalese spicy, or Sri Lankan spicy, or Chinese spicy, or Thai spicy, or Korean spicy, get the 2 chilli spicy! Mie Goreng is yummy! Loved the potato wedges as well :):)","Had an early dinner here and ordered the nasi goreng for starters and the Mexican tacos as mains. (My friend had the seafood marinara pasta and the taco's) All the food tasted nice. The goreng tasted different from all the nasi goreng's I've ever had, but not a bad change. The taco's were by far the highlight of the dine experience here, highly recommend those!

The cocktails on the other hand were poorly made and the margaritas were just tequila and weird tasting lime juice. No triple sec or cointreau present. The mojito tasted like it was missing some flavour, yet the rum punch was definitely present. In bar presence they can definitely grow significantly.","My wife and I ordered the Crispy Calimary and the fish and chips appetizers.  The Calimary was not good and we did not eat
We mention to the staff but they say no it is good. They charge me for it anyways even though I complained. The fish and chips was poor. The B&B Poke Bowl, the chicken Saute were very good. The smoothie was good too. I do not think we will go back. A few steps away is much better with a much better atmosphere.

The Calimary did not taste fresh and was like a rubber band. Not tender and succulent. It had a funny taste."

Well, both the kind of dishes had this ridiculous amount of fries. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal, I asked the waiter if it wasn‚Äôt little for the dish and he said that that was the standard portion. So, from this my review. Good food, insignificant portions.

My partner had garlic prawn with rice. The prawns were pathetically small. One of the smallest prawns that I have eaten after so long in Bali since most restaurants serve decently huge prawns.

Calamari rings were quite bad as it was small and somewhat under-fried. However the fries were decently good.

You should choose company leaving at 6am maybe you'll have more chance to see it.,"Very bad place. They promise to bring you to Manta Bay for snorkeling. And they bring you to Crystal Bay for snorkeling. They deceive tourists.

As we understand, the low season for snorkeling on Nusa Penida is from September to May. At this time, In Manta Bay are hit by very large waves and it is very dangerous to go there. At this time they promise to bring you to Manta Bay, but on the way they pretend to be surprised that the waves are big and you can‚Äôt swim there. And they go to Crystal Bay.

If you do not want to snorkel at Crystal Bay, your money will not be returned. We didn't get our money back and didnt snokeling because we wanted to snorkeling only in Manta Bay and see manta ray.

If you come to this place, refuse the excursion and return the money. Do not use the services of this company. SKAM","Absolutley not recomended, we where told we would be 3-3:30h snorkeling at 4 different manta points and we just went to 1 manta place and 2 coral places (1 of them just in front of the beach)"

Private beach.
Beautiful interior, dishes and details. Comfortable large bed and a gorgeous view from the window.
There is a sushi restaurant right across the street.
Beautiful friendly hostess. I'm delighted! This is my best vacation! Thank you!","An absolute sincere recommendation, the accommodation was large, very nicely furnished and the location was perfect for us! There are stairs leading directly to the beach and one of the two bedrooms has a sea view. The other room faces the street, which can be a bit noisy in the evening or early in the morning, but we still slept very well! The bedrooms are both equipped with air conditioning and the breakfast was also very tasty. We were within walking distance of our diving school and could make great excursions from there. The owner was very friendly, accommodating and communication was easy. On the day of our departure, she spontaneously arranged a taxi for us! We were very lucky to find this lovely accommodation.","Wonderful apartment that I can imagine of.
The sea view makes me feel relaxed.
Would definitely come back, not only the host is friendly but also the whole apartment is beautiful.","Great experience, such a beautiful place , right in front of the beach, perfect location , I totally recommend this place","Stunningly beautiful location with super kind and hospitable staff. Highly, highly recommend."
