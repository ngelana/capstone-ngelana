For me, the room is 6.5/10 because the air conditioner is very noisy, and the bathroom does not provide a sanitary kit (they only provide a small sachet of soap) and does not provide mineral water for guests. The swimming pool is quite clean, but they have ongoing construction on the first floor, so it‚Äôs quite messy.

However, the one thing that mesmerized me was the view‚Äîthe paddy field view with the sound of ocean waves. We walked to Biaung Beach by crossing the paddy field, and it was amazing!","Sorry to say that the price you pay really is what you gonna get. I paid for this place as low as Rp 167,000, well I thought the view of paddy field can compensate for the basic room for the price. But this place really need a renovation for its mouldy walls.

One more thing to note is that the pictures displayed on booking platform are not actual.","The staff is not always available in the hotel.

The room size was spacious, but it was dirty when I was there.

Insufficient lighting, it was so dark and spooky in the night.

Beautiful view next to the rice field in the morning though.","Not satisfied.

Cheap ‚Äúvilla‚Äù with a dusty room and many things didn‚Äôt work. there was almost noone everytime I am at the receptionist.

The swimming pool wasn‚Äôt clean.
Did I mention no towel, water drinking rubbish bin, even toilet paper.","Very nasty place. Worst so far, can‚Äôt believe that for 150 000 rp we have this s**t hole. Alot of mold, smells like mold and also not been cleaned nothing for a while. Lots of ants in the bed aswell as dust litteraly everywhere. Been told its because it only re-opened after covid. Truly awful. Glad we only stay 1 night.

Staff person was nice tho. Althought not very concerned about how dirty it is.

0.5/10, atleast we have a roof"

When I am back, wow, the road from Bypass Mandre connected directly to the beach here.

It was cover with bushes and tall grass few years ago. But, now is beautiful. Since this beach is few steps away from my house, I could jog and walk in the morning and enjoying the sunrise üëçüèΩ

- They provide a dining table and several chairs outside
- However, there will be a TPST built next to this kos, so I am not sure about the air quality after this.

The Food Menu ranges from 6K Nasi Putih as expected up to 60K for Rib Eye Steak and 3 Paket Choices from 40K-55K.

It was too hot to eat this day so I just ordered up an Oreo Milkshake...MilkshKe gets lost i translation a bit as it arrived more like an Oreo Drink. Not sure if it was over blended or the heat melted it before it got to me, tasty but not a ‚Äòmilkshake‚Äô in the traditional sense.

Seating for 25+ people plus 4 toilets in all, but very little parking if in a car so I‚Äôd suggest a scooter for this journey.

Quiet location overall as it sits right next to the Muara Jetty leading to the beach which about a 10 minute walk away.

Other nice little niche features is the ATV Rentals and the Horseback Riding if the mood strikes.

A good experience but can be easily passed in this hidden away oasis.","we waited 25 minutes for a cappuccino and it came out of the coffee machine.  35 minutes later they brought us capcay seefood and nasi goreng.  look at this cap cay, it will not be enough even for a child.  and the cabbage in nasi goreng was rotten.  By the way, the prices are very much increased compared to what is indicated in the photo.  chicken steak costs 180,000 rupees) in general, pass by.  here you will remain hungry and angry.",Muara Kopi and adventure have no building permit (IMB : it is mandatory to show this at the entrance). Consequently they also have no business license neighter for keeping horses nor for a cafe. Now they invite customers to ride loud and noisy ATV on the normally quiet beach. No permit for that. So if you have an accident at this place don't think they will have a insurance! They are disturbing neighbors and a lot of people that enjoy the quiet of our beach.,"Menu options are good, a lot of unique dishes you can order. There is also a nice 2nd floor view over the Ayung River where you can enjoy and drink your latte. Staff are also really friendly and are able to do extra favors (exp,. Adding milk into your tea). Destination is a little remote and dangerous when using a motorcycle but overall this restaurant is ""menyenangkan""!","As the way It's called, Muara Kopi Bali is located near the estuary, specifically, the estuary is in front of the restaurant.
You can see the way Ayung river flows in to Tangtu Beach.

The restaurant had a good taste of food, clean, quiet, staff or host was really friendly, kind and helpful.
You could have some food here and ride a horse to the beach, or ride an ATV.
The --what is it called? Ehmmm people who take care of the horses and help us to ride the horses-- were really helpful and good skilled.
It's a really comfort place to have lunch or dinner with your family.
The rest room was clean with a shower inside.
Love the spot a lot.
Would come again next time."
