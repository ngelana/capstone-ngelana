Friendly people, good food and peaceful vibes.","Wonderful place, staying with a local family surrounded by gorgeous rice fields. We were unprepared and didn't bring food so the family kindly offered to prepare dinner for us ðŸ’š Rooms are simple but great value for money. Welcome drink of fresh lemon water with organic lemon from the garden was lovely. There's no amenities in the area so come prepared! Then you can truly relax and enjoy nature :)","Remote, cozy place, very warm and friendly family. They make nice food. A very quiet area and a beautiful walk to reach it. The Wi-Fi was even good enough for web browsing and phone calls","- the food was good/there is a nice rice terrace area around the corner/it was cheap
- I was looking for a quiet place, there is a building site with external workers now on the compound/the bed is too short (me: 1,80m)/the radio starts at 6:30 in the morning, everything is very tight on the compound, you can hear everything, the family lived behind the wall of the room I was trying to sleep, I heard somebody snoring, so you have the ""balinese family lifestyle experience"" all the time, I spend as much time as possible outside, to have some tranquillity

comment after reading the answer to my review: I dont think any marketing blabla will change anything. This place is not what to expect, because of the marketing blabla. Consider this. (There is no view from your place. Outside, somewhere in Tababan, but not at your place. The description of your place is a fraud.)","Absolutely amazing place to stay if you are looking for a spot close to jatiluwih rice terraces. Extremly friendly family, you can use their kitchen, there is a brand new bathroom, and the room is super clean, and the place is super quite! Gede even showed me his neighbourhood on his scooter, since I had a car. Lovely place!"
