ChIJSWSfcR8n0i0RT4_o78xAK1I,Sang Tirta Farm Living Resort,-8.3915227,115.13590819999999,"peselatan desa Belulang, Mengesta, Kec. Penebel, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 80152, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=5920897384051150671,OPERATIONAL,+62 819-0707-0745,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.2,52,,"It's a wonderful farm stay in Bali, never expect such a great and peaceful place here.. ‚ù§Ô∏è cold wind in the night... quiet, only insects orchestra we can hear,  amazing!! We enjoy every moment here!
Good for retreat, family and friends gathering, very private place..strolling friendly.
Swimming pool was not functioning on the day we were there.

All staff are nice, polite and helpful!",It was an absolute nightmare. We fled the place at first daybreak forfeiting 3 more nights. Horrendous rooms smell and feels like a stuffy basement. No services or staff. No Transportation - Gojek/Uber won't come to the property - 20 mins brisk walk to where you can get a ride. Yet this vital information was not shared with me until the day we arrived.,"It should be 3.5 üåü

Because the food offered here is not good and expensive here.
even I can feel they try to show the sincerity of the food, but tasty and  Ingredients are just fine...but not worth the price.
The meals look really old school, actually kinda cute.
But the breakfast just I don‚Äôt know how to say...
Here is a 10-15 minute drive to the little town, the road is a bit steep, just be careful.
By walk to town maybe take 1 hour down...
So if you don't have transportation, you definitely should bring some food.
But they don't have a place to cook...
lose one start.

If you don't have transportation by yourself, you gonna be a bit hard to move.
So lose 0.5 starts.
Because here is a bit far place, you gonna pay more for a taxi. (but yeah it is fair enough )

Maybe nothing to do more around here.
but just walk around the farm and enjoy the room, the mountain is also good.
we stayed the room is second-floor villa padi
I love the balcony so much. Yoga, meditation or just dancing with the whole Mountain, farm view. Ôºàif not rain)
Here is a comment about the rainy afternoon.
They offer umbrellas.
Also, chilling in the room on a rainy day is one of my favourite things ‚ù§Ô∏èI love it. the view is still pretty.

The tv comes with NetflixüòÇso nice.
Wifi almost time is good.
Only maybe a few times not good, wait for 30 mins.

Not crowded people here, they have enough space between each room.
Good for intense sex ~
I just run away from Ubud.
no car noise, smell.
Don't need to socialise much.
Only small stream sounds and insects sound.
Full glasses around the room. wake up with sunshine.

Maybe a bit wet, but not too hot...
Nice cold at night time.
The room is ventilation so I am good with no air conditioning.

There are some mosquitoes, but I didn‚Äôt get bit so badly, It‚Äôs fine for me.

a bit dusty, the space is traditional building and ventilation, I feel it is fair enough.
I am ok with that.

There is moss in the pool...but the water looks clean, not a chemical smell. But I didn't try it.

I like here.
I will come back again if I finger out how to deal with the food problem here.

*the hot spring is nearby walking about 15 mins.
10 dollars for a foreigner, a bit small, not super clean but yeah it's ok, you know that‚Äôs cheap so...
Only one small pool be warned, the big one is cold.
Not many people, so it's a good point for me.

Have a nice trip everyone~","4/5
It was overall an OK stay.
4 for location. It was located in a nice green surrounding with tranquil atmosphere.  I enjoyed the morning breeze. Unfortunately it was facing the west :)
4 for cleanliness of the gladak house. some termite started to eat up the wooden blocks.
3.5 for cleanliness of the natural spring water plunge pool. Water was crystal clear but the pool base was a bit full of dried leaves and some moss
3 for food. taste was standard and menus rather very limited with not so much of local Balinese dishes.
4 for services. Staffs were friendly and helpful. thanks!
3.5 for overall safety. pathway to the villa from the entrance shouldn't be made as ramp, it could be slippery during rainy season (time when moss will start to grow). All was good during my stay but it was too steep for a ramp way.","Really beautiful place with a spectacular environment where you can enjoy and relax, either with your family, couple or alone. Great and healthy food, friendly and attentive staff, perfect natural pool temperature. Large and beautiful rooms well adapted to the environment. Perfect rice fields, fresh air and good energy to disconnect and reconnect.
I will come back obviously."
