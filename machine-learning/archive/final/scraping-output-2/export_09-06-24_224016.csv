Big parking area with shops just infront of the gate. With Rp. 25.000/person we can enjoy the beautiful trees, fresh air, and photo spots. They still bring the natural texture of the land and just adding the wood, bamboo, and root to make it gorgeous. More than ten spots to have before going down to the waterfall of Love and valley of Love (lembah cinta). The staffs are super friendly. We can try the swing and the flying fox as well by adding some tickets. We enjoy to visit it.","Beautiful place, but the road is very curvy. Entrance ticket IDR 20.000/pax. If you want to find beautiful spot picture this is one of the place you must visit in Bali.",Now the waterfall looks like this. Maybe that's why this place is abandoned and there are no signs.,A unique place to take a big bird nest for people who love adventure,Beautiful waterfall with beautiful natural scenery. It's well worth a visit.
