I believe it’s by far the best fitness location with state-of-the-art facilities. The teachers were off quality and experienced, they know how to bring the best out of you in the class. Plus their service staff are amazing. After class, you can recover at their recovery zone, co-work in their comfy spaces or just eat delicious clean protein rich meals at their cafe. Fun fact: I left my book in the club and the service staff was responsive to my inquiries. I will definitely come again and try more classes.","One of the best experiences of my life!!! Nirvana is literally a paradise within Bali. The facilities are absolutely insane, the craziest gym, yoga studio & recovery / treatment spaces. Everything is so well managed and the nirvana team is super friendly - you’ll feel like you’ve known them your whole life. They have the BEST trainers, coaches and nutritionists ever. It’s such a holistic experience because the food is also amazing and so healthy. The transportation was the best, most hassle-free thing ever. From picking me up at the airport, to taking me to Nirvana everyday at 7:30am - Ajik (the head of transportation) made the process so easy. Literally wish I could stay at Nirvana permanently. It’s perfect. Worth every single penny. I’ll definitely be visiting again very soon for a longer time!!!","From the moment you walk in, you're greeted by a warm and welcoming community that instantly makes you feel at home. The atmosphere is vibrant and motivating, creating the perfect environment to achieve your fitness goals.

The team at Nirvana Strength is truly amazing. The trainers are highly skilled and offer incredible classes that cater to all fitness levels. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced athlete, you'll find the perfect class to challenge and inspire you. The operations staff is equally fantastic, ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently, which adds to the overall exceptional experience.

If you're looking for a fitness center that offers more than just a workout, Nirvana is the place to be. The combination of a supportive community, great atmosphere, and an outstanding team of employees makes every visit a pleasure. I highly recommend it to anyone in Canggu!","When your favorite place on earth’s best staff Krisna, asks you to write a review on Google, you must do it.
I have been traveling around the world and always looking for nice gyms and activities. However, Nirvana is literally the best gym I have ever been to. It's not just a nice gym; it's the top calisthenics resort where you can find the strongest people, not just physically but also mentally. You receive inspiring information about how high the ceiling of our physical achievement can be. If you ever visit Canggu, you should come experience Nirvana.","If you’re into health and fitness, this club is heaven on earth. I can’t say enough great things but to name a few, their group classes are top notch with awesome instructors, their kitchen is delicious with endless high-protein options, and the pool/recovery facilities are a dream. If lived in Bali, I would basically live at Nirvana."

This haven is perfect for a health-focused holiday. The clean, air-conditioned room provided a comfortable retreat, and the classes led by Holly and her team were amazing. With a pool, spa, ice baths, sauna, and delicious, healthy food, I didn't feel the need to leave the village. The friendly team, especially Nancy and her reception crew, made the experience even more enjoyable. Highly recommended for a unique Bali experience!","4th time staying at Wanderlust.

Holly is great at managing your stay and she’s an amazing coach as well. Highly recommend for anyone wanted to explore Bali, Canggu and train and relax at the gym and recovery area. All in one, what else would you want 🤩","Had an amazing trip to Wanderlust Bali! Gym is amazing, lots of great coaches, and killer workouts. I did the Eat Sleep Train package, and villas were nice, quiet, clean, and pool side! Yummy protein smoothies, and friendly staff on site. Thank you Coach Dave Driskell and team! Overall a great experience.","Great open gym for those that like to do your own thing, plenty of space and equipment.
Classes are also good and helpful to stay motivated.
My rooms rating is for gym rooms as I haven't stayed here.
Could do with a boxing bag or 2 available for open gym times as your only allowed to use them in a class and some disc weights need maintenance.
Pool and recovery area is a great touch as for the full send package you can use as much as you like which is great"

The staff is wonderful and they make you feel like home. I'm traveling solo but here it's so easy to meet people. Staff also hangs out in the evening and arranges some nights out.
If you want a quiet night, it's also possible since there is another small common area where you can chill.
Also The Hostel can help you with trips around Bali, scooter rental etc. Pool is nice and the rooms are always clean!!! There's a kitchen which you can use and store your stuff in the fridge.

Thank you guys ","I stayed in the female dorm. The rooms and bathrooms were cleaned every single day which is EXTREMELY important for a beach destination. The staff are all great.

Just something to note is the doors to the room and bathroom are loud and some guests don’t try to minimize the noise they make so wear earplugs if you’re easily woken up.","By far the best hostel I have stayed while traveling across south east Asia. The whole team really puts in a effort to get to know you personally and make sure you have a unforgettable time in Canggu. The vibe really feels like my home away from home. Every night they organize different events and bars to go to, such as cocktail nights, beach clubs, and some pretty awesome night clubs. As a solo traveler it was a awesome way to meet other travelers and have a memorable night out! The hostel also host a communal kitchen which you can cook you’re  meals and store you’re drinks and food in there fridge, what more can you ask for!!! Shout out to Mita and Alfin, you guys are great!","feel like home while in Bali! this hostel is run by the most caring & welcoming people, and has a chill family-like vibe that will make you want to extend your stay (over and over again!)

the rooms are well-kept and have clean sheets & towels provided. also, the main area is the perfect place to hang out & meet people.

The weekly cleaning is nice and the staff are always making sure the facilities are up and running. I would recommend Butterfly Bali Guesthouse to anyone who enjoys being centrally located and a good night sleep.,"We stayed here almost three weeks. It was nice! Recently opened so everything was new. Very friendly and helpful staff. They were still dealing with a few water issues (toilet was leaking in the bathroom), but that wasn’t a problem for us. There was nothing where we could hang our towels after showering, but maybe they changed that by now. The garden is beautiful and decorated with all these butterflies.","We stayed at Butterfly Bali Guesthouse at the beginning of our backpack trip. We had a deluxe room with outside bathroom which was amazing!! We felt really welcome, thanks to the lovely staff who is always prepared to help you. They keep everything nice and clean. We enjoyed the guesthouse so much that we decided to return at the end of our trip to spend the last days there. It felt a like home far away from home 😄! We could easily rent a scooter and the staff arranged taxi drivers on request. Thanks for having us!","Love everyone that stay in here. All the helpers is really warm, the room is quite spacious (depend on which room you're staying)
The kitchens also really spacious.They have two of em and also pools.

The best thing is the quietness of Canggu and loving the rooftop view. It is the tallest building in the area and it creates a mesmerizing view of ricefields, a lil bit of GWK statue, and sunset. For digital nomads like me, the 3 coworking spaces and fast WiFi are such a plus point. The rooms are clean and each one has a private balcony facing the ricefields.

Overall, the place is worth every penny spent. Really recommend👍","Loving this place so much!! At first, I was overthinking to stay here due to the see through curtain review from the Google review because I need to have a long sleep from my trip and jetlag. But turns out, they have changed the curtain into the blackout and the Internet is so freaking fast. I really love how they provide lots and lots of coworking space as I needed to. 2 indoor coworking in first and second floor and a super duper huge outdoor coworking place in fifth floor. And the best part is they have a roof top to see sunset and do yoga while sun bath. The lobby is super nice and it feels like home. Their staffs are the best and super friendly (as all Balinese people are). I really recommend all of you to stay here just for vacation, business, or maybe both of them!! I will stay here in the future definitely!!!","Amazing place to live! I was spending 3,5 months at Shashvata. It’s an amazing place for working as you have many different coworking areas and a nice café with good food and drinks for affordable prices. The rooms are really nice as well and the staff is just awesome. They are nice, helpful and always making sure you’re ok. The location is good, there is a nice gym really close (Nirvana) and the beach is a 10 mins drive with the scooter. Also really accessible if you want to drive to Denpasar, Ubud or other areas. Can highly recommend Shashvata! Thank you to everyone who has made my stay so pleasurable.","I would recommend to any remote worker out there. Perfect conditions, you have 3 nice co-working spaces, a pool and even a cafe inside!! No need to go out for food and get distracted from work.

Donny, his wife and the team are super nice and make you feel like home immediately!

I found a used toothpick and ear bud in the room.

The pillow cases had some stains.

The bathrooms are really not great, they are half outdoors, so you shower with lizards, snails and all kinds of things if it rains.

Doors are not sealed to the bedroom at the bottom, so often I’d find ants and bugs coming through there.

Yes its tranquil with a nice big lush garden so some of these things can’t be helped, but they could try a little better to prevent it.

It’s 450k IDR per night and only 15 minutes into Canggu, so that’s the main selling point.

Personally I’d in hindsight rather spend a little more for something a little less raw.","What a beautiful place it is!! Very comfortable, you can hear the sound of nature around, the garden is so beautiful a place to rest in crazy Canggu! I LOVE it! There is no breakfast but the near coffee place delivery an amazing breakfast just at your room door, the number is inside the room!","Nice and quiet place. We had some noise from equipment from the rice field but it was not an issue as they only work when the sun is out.
Over great location, slightly off the grid, but just a 10-15 min scooter ride from the busy area.
Only issue was water pressure in the shower and smell coming out of the toilet. Other than that it was great.","The location was great, everything was within a short distance.

I opted for a private room at an additional cost, which was a bit expensive but highly comfortable. The atmosphere here is homely, and the people you meet become like family. The staff was amazing and very helpful, always with a smile.

The food is reasonably priced and delicious, especially when compared to other places I've stayed in Bali. They offer the best food with a variety of options.

The surf instructors are professional, ensuring you always feel safe. I want to express my gratitude to my instructor, Arki. He took care of me from the beginning to the end, was there, patiently guiding me and helping me overcome my fears. Thanks to Arki's dedicated support, my skills soared at an incredible pace, and now, surfing is not just a hobby but a passion that fills my heart with joy and gratitude.

This place makes you want to come back. Many thanks to the entire staff for their outstanding job.","Overall there is not much structure in the camp. After check in you don‘t get any Information about how to join surfsessions or other offerings of the camp. You need to ask for everything.

Theory lesson is only once a week, so it can be that you can‘t join it if you stay shorter. Video anslysis was also not that great. They just film one group and you never know when and where so you also don‘t know if you get analysed. The free scooters are really old and often out of fuel, because the guests don‘t go to gas station after usage.

The coaches often are drunk in the evening and flirty in a way that girls I met there were anoyed from it. Also me and my friends expirienced that the knowledge you get really depends on the different coaches and their motivation. However their knowledge is really good and if you ask them you get a helpful answer most times.

To get the free breakfast worked well and also the accommodation was nice and clean. Reception was also helpful.

Location of the camp could be better. You drive at least 30-45min to the surf spots so you loose up to 3 hours a day for driving around if you join two sessions a day.
For socializing it is good, you meet many people.

Surfboards are not in the best condition, bit for beginners ok.",A great place to stay if you want to learn surfing from ground up. Teachers are very helpful and can tell you how to improve on yourself. Staff in the camp is also very friendly and the food is affordable and good. The only things that are a little bit annoying are the distance to the main surfing spot( Kuta) and the generous amount of cameras watching every part of the camp(feels like you are constantly watched).,We LOVED this place! We stayed for four nights and did their beginner surf course. Every single instructor and staff member were so warm and fun and the overall energy of this place was incredible. They are all great teachers and we felt really well looked after in the hotel and in the waves. We will likely be back 😝,"It’s a nice camp if you’re a beginner and like to party, but I wouldn’t recommend this camp for intermediates. I learned to surf here a couple of years ago and it was great, also since the vibe of the camp is fun and the staff is super kind! So I came back, but was unfortunately quite disappointed.

There’s one star and two star session, where one star is for the people that just finished the beginner course and two star for everyone else. There should definitely be more differentiated levels and also a bit more spots on offer for two stars. Also, they have a fixed schedule of going out at 7am (weekdays) or 9am (weekends) every day, which doesn’t always fit the conditions. It would be so much better to have a flexible schedule and go out according to conditions (e.g. tide, wind, etc.).

The surf guiding is barely existent, there’s no spot introduction, warm up, or feedback in any way. If you go out with the two star group, most of the time the guides just surf themselves and would often even take the waves the guests are just paddling for. Even if you ask for guiding or help with choosing waves, they would perhaps halfheartedly help you. And if you go out to the reefs with the boat, it allegedly costs 100k IDR per person, even if you’re 6 people. So in total, we paid 600k IDR for a less than 5min boat ride, which I find outrageous! If you hire the boat directly, you usually pay something between 50-70k IDR, so what kind of deal does the camp have?

The rooms are ok, but could use a bit of love. If you want to go to bed early, avoid the Lumbungs or main building, as it’s usually quite loud in the evenings. The restaurant serves good, cheap food and the beers.

So if you’re an intermediate, it’s much better value for money to hire a private surf guide or choose a different camp. If you’re a beginner, go for it, you’re gonna have a great time!"

They also have a laundry service where you get to pay 10.000 IDR/kilogram. The rooms are spacious and each has its own couch too.

Dumpling is small but very good though!","My husband and I are super regulars at this place and staffs are so nice and very friendly! And of course quality of meats and banchan are so so good too! As a Korean, this is a place I am truly thankful for. Xoxo!!","The food are great. I ordered the samgyupsal and doenjang jjigae. I think this restaurant one of the best korean restaurants in Bali. When you craving korean bbq, you should try this. The service also good. Will be back again! Recommended! I think they need to have a proper place to wash hand.","For the first time I’m not finish my korean bbq food..

I love korean Food, especially korean Barbeque..
Today go there for celebrate my 1st Salary from work, lunch with my sister and my best friend..
The place is okay, vibe like korean restaurant with wall full of hand writing, that is cute actually .
First I complain about the music too loud, because the quality of speaker not  good, so its really hurt to hear .
But the waitress turn down the volume, thank you for that .
The services actually okay, they quick .
So about the services, everything is okay .

But I very dissapointed with the quality of the meat, I order Beef meat .
It’s not fresh, Im sorry to say this.
When the meat come, i can tell its not fresh from the color.
I like to grill the meat crispy, so when the waitress  come, I didnt see butter .
I ask, where is the margarine ? She said dont have, because the meat have fat so the oil will be become from the fat .
So okay, I continue to cook.
And when i cook, the oil from the fat is not like usually, not many oil from the fat .
I dont have appetite at all to eat, from the first appearance and now the meat look so dry, no oil.

So i ask the waitress butter or something so can make it will be crispy, and it is what it is.
Even Its already crispy, the taste not even better.

The kimchi so sour, sorry..
But I also order 2 ramen.
The ramen is good, I like it .
But the meat, i am sorry .

Maybe today is not my lucky day ..","Portions are an absolute joke. Ordered 2 sets of Jae Yuk Buk Um, got enough jaeyuk buk um to barely fill a single bowl of rice.

Not enough to feed a child.
See photo of what was delivered and what 200k of jaeyuk buk um gets you.

Complete rip off"

The breakfast fast options were brilliant and the breakfast itself was absolutely delicious. The accommodation it just a short Grab ride from the beach, there is a supermarket next door.","I would not recommend this place to anyone seeking a peaceful and restful stay in Bali. Be cautious when viewing the photos and facilities online, as they appear heavily edited and far from reality. For instance, there is no TV in the room, and the bed sheets have unsightly stains. Despite using the best earplugs available, the relentless noise from the main road next to the hotel is unavoidable.

The room service is disappointingly poor, as they ignore any requests, and the manager's behavior is extremely rude. To top it off, be prepared to encounter geckos in the bathroom that may bite you during your shower. Additionally, the rooms lack any soundproofing, leaving you at the mercy of your neighbors' conversations and balcony activities throughout the night—even with the windows closed.

In summary, I cannot recommend this establishment to anyone. It falls short of being a boutique experience and is a far cry from even the most basic hostels.","Great place to stay near the most crowded places of Canggu. The rooms are big and comfortable. Friendly staff. Yoga available if booked the day beforehand. The best was the food. Great restaurant- there is an all day breakfast restaurant and a seafood restaurant. The seafood restaurant was very good, we ate there twice even if Canggu is full of amazing restaurants. The fried noodles with seafood were incredibly delicious. Only annoying thing must be that the hotel is located next to a busy road so there is always noise from motorbikes.","Located off the main  Canggu road, Taman Nauli is definitely an amazing place and worth visiting. They have a beautiful restaurant surrounding by luxurious nature. The whole place is stunning. Their rooms are simply wonderful. They have a yoga Shala too. Definitely worth a visit and even a stay.","The place is beautiful and the rooms are nice, clean and spacious, importantly the bed is comfortable and the location is great if you want to be close to both canggu and seminyak. Close enough to most yoga spots in canggu and popular brunch areas but apart from this there are some little details that could be improved
1) Really friendly staff but some of the staff spoke little to no English which made it frustrating. I also felt like they had to be asked to do things instead of proactive service , for instance if I have to go to the car when it’s raining heavily to shelter me with an umbrella and when I asked if they can pick me up with one when I return and I’ll honk, they didn’t so I was wet and the two staff cleaning the reception area didn’t bother and were more focused on covering the sofas from the rain
2) When I checked in, the pillows smelled sweaty / have been used and even the next day after the room was cleaned it smelled like this so I had to ask for it to be changed. Again the case of no proactive service from the staff , I have to ask for them to burn a coil for the mosquitos before they do so. Towels were not changed promptly.
3)  because the beds are comfortable i knocked out but you can definitely hear the traffic from the busy main road it’s next to"

They were kind, punctual and the food was delicious! I highly recommend! Thanks again for everything!","I order catering for our private event. We book for buffet and live BBQ. The lunch time at 12.30. And they coming at 12.30, unprepared at all. I already mention specifically that this event only have 1hour for the lunch time. So i want to make sure everything is on time. They really unprepared, everything in a rush. They promise us vegan corner, what i've got only a plate. And since they are in a rush, they even put a tray of the food in the middle of bushes. The skewer were burnt out. And also there is no tag menu in each dishes as promised. They also promised 3 kind of sauces for the BBQ, but they dont serve even 1, and finally they serve 1 kind of sauce in last 15minutes

If you dont want to ruin your event, dont order this catering!! Very very u professional!!! Untrusted!!! And i paid 10.5million for them to ruin my event!","First time I tried Quesadillas (veggie), it really tasty and delicious. Very recommended, you should try it🥰","Good food, good mood. Big portion, friendly staff and good exterior - interior. Located at heart of Canggu area. Recommended and will going back.","Very friendly atmosphere with good service.

I appreciate sharing my feedback and look forward to more wonderful adventures in amigos. Amazing sunset views.,"Guesthouse located in a quiet street of Canggu .
Simple yet clean and value for money rooms .
Rooftop with nice views and shared kitchen.
Very friendly and accommodating staff .","My partner and I stayed in the Amigos villa for a month whilst we were in Canggu and we absolutely loved it. We felt like we had our own tranquil haven in Canggu, as the Villa is located in a quiet peaceful area but only a short moped drive away from the busyness of Canggu. The pool area is gorgeous and there was regular maintenance whilst we were there. It is well equipped with an open plan kitchen dining area and even a large TV. Rizky and the owner were always on hand if needed and super helpful. We would love to return when we are back in Canggu. Highly recommend to anyone staying in the area!"
