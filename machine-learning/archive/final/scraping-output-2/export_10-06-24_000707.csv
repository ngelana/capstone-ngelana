Hati Suci is such a lovely place. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The houses are very beautiful. Hati Suci is surrounded by nature and rice fields, so there are bugs, ants, lizards and frogs. But they come and go and you don‚Äôt have to be afraid of them. Also there are some sweet cats and a dog keeping company with you, if you (or them) want to. The manager, Ita, is always ready to help you, she can order you massages or a driver and helps you with everything else, just ask her. Hati Suci Team: thank you a lot, we will keep you in good memories!","A place with very nice common areas and a yoga studio.
It is located in the heart of nature in the vast rice fields.
nature is truly wonderful.
20 minutes to ubud centre.
Room cleaning is sometimes done late.  Rooms are a bit small for crowded guests","Calm, beautiful with stunning service.
We visited with our teenage daughter, and had the best family holiday of our life. The setting is stunning, in peaceful rice fields outside of Ubud. The centre itself is very tranquil, with beautifully crafted open buildings, and gorgeous landscaping. Just thinking about it calms my system. I felt very safe there. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  I appreciated their suggestions of where to go, and how they arranged transport for us. It took the hassle away.","I had an amazing time! Such a wonderful welcome from the owners who have created a beautiful, magical space. Set in a rural village it was very special to have an authentic experience of Balinese life. And the staff are just so lovely, making great food and helping in any way they can. Great place if you want some time out but also near enough to visit temples, waterfalls, Ubud, etc. Best of both worlds üòä","What a beautiful place in the middle of tranquil rice fields. The owners make you feel right at home, the staff are all really friendly and helpful, with lots of advice on where to go and what to see nearby. We had the freedom of cooking for ourselves and hanging by the pool, relaxing in the peace and quiet. Would definitely and highly recommend to anyone as very suitable for both young and old, couples and families. Absolutely loved our stay, was great value for money and will definitely be back for further stays! Thank you so much!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

The location is so secluded thats why u get the best view. The view it self is just impeccable, the villa is so spacious and beautifully designed, and ofcourse gotta give credit to the amazing crew who took care of us during our stay, they made us feels like we‚Äôre home. Totally recommended","If you're looking for luxury in the middle of the jungle this place has it.

Just finished our 3 night stay at this villa and it absolutely worth it! The staff were super friendly and we enjoyed  the quick meals.

Things to note:
1. If you're faint of heart of bugs, keep in mind you're in a jungle.

2. There are Geico's that make a barking sound at night and can get quite loud, but don't mind them.

3. There is a 20% ""villa fee"" charged for the meals that the staff prepare not included in your stay.","Great experience, awesome staff, super food, fancy interior. Swimming at the pool is very refreshing. The staff keeps everything very clean, help you with everything. The ordered meals are wonderful. If you turn off all lights, you see no other lightsource around you. You hear many different animals, they guide you to a wonderful sleep.","Wonderful place!
We stayed with our kids and we loved it. The house is well maintained and clean. The stuff was very helpful and nice. We had very delicious and high quality dinner and breakfast. The arrangement with the driver was good and the driver was very funny.
Unforgettable was the guided tour with the house keeper thru the rice paddies and surrounding small villages away from the normal tourists tracks.

Thanks to the whole team.","Such an amazing stay for a very good price. Other than being surprised by charges for more guests (not over capacity), the stay was perfect. Nyos, Made, and Wayan made the stay easy, and made AMAZING food. If you are going to Ubud, this is THE place to stay."

Lovely country wibe with high quality of food (was much better than breakfast in our 5 star hotel),"Really nice people attending us and explaining everything we wanted to know about their culture and way of living. Apart from that, the food is really good and much cheaper than in the touristic areas.
If you want to escape from typical places this is the one to go to.","Was looking forward to have some local food that‚Äôs super affordable looking at the 5 star review and nice photos! Unfortunately, the place was already closed by 6.30pm despite the opening hours stating that it‚Äôd be open till 8.30pm. So perhaps lunch would be a better option for anyone who wants to try!

Still going to give a 4 star for its potential, because we dropped by the location and saw the overall atmosphere, and local neighbours were nice enough to chat with us and tell us it‚Äôs closed early so generally nice vibes. Just a note to the warung to perhaps post it online or change the google opening hours so that we don‚Äôt have to ride over in the rain and don‚Äôt get to try it ^.^‚Äù","Amazing food and very welcoming , can't go wrong with this restaurant and the prices are amazing. Highly recommend üëå",Very nice and cozy Warung. Host speaks English. Food was delicious so we didn't take any photos lol
