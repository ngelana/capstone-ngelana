Anyway, the staff were super friendly and it is the most important things.

I think they also smoke their own selection of meat & seafood which they sell by weight.

We opted for their breakfast set (avail 7.30 -10.00) with choices of any brunch menu + choice of fruit juices + choice of coffee/tea all for only 95k which is a very good deal, as their menu already priced at around 80-105k

Food was tasty & unique, with ingredients mostly home made. A fresh option for you if you are bored with typical Australian style breakfast menu.

Service was prompt & kind. (As they have to cover both inside and outside seating). We chose outside seating as they were comfortably covered with enough trees and shrubbery. It is located right next to a main road though, if pollution is your concern.

Limited parking, better if you are using motorbike. But the parking attendant will help you park your car & find parking spot.

Non halal. Using pork ingredients.","Great Place to have Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner.
Super friendly Staff, delicious food with an amazing display.
Highly recommended.","I‚Äôve been to Warung Go√ªth√© about five times in the past and always enjoyed delicious food with perfect service. However, tonight was a disaster. We waited at our table for 15 minutes without anyone taking our order. Eventually, we realized we had to order and pay at the cashier, where there was a long queue.
The terrace was dirty, the staff unfriendly, and several other customers left. It's disappointing that they no longer provide any service.
With so many other fantastic options available, it won't be long before they close down.
We won't be returning, a party of four who wanted to enjoy a nice meal!","Food was pretty good but can get quite rich for the palette,  heavy from the cheese & cream, so very French.  The portions are very generous, definitely European sized but would advise to share if you arent big eaters. Its self service which is fine, but our only issue was that the furniture in the garden area was partially rusty and had sharp edges so we had to be very careful that we didn't hurt ourselves on it. Overall it was a decent place and meal but nothing too special and slightly pricey albeit the large portion sizes.","It's wrong to put the sauce on the octopus without knowing if people would like it. I would have liked to dip the octopus in the sauce myself. The sauce was disgusting and ruined everything. The white dog was happy though.

Update: After eating at this restaurant, I felt sick and had a bad time. I don't recommend it or suggest they serve the sauce separately."

It has diverse √† la carte and a amazing tasting menu‚Ä¶ anyway you go, for sure you‚Äôll have a delicious dining experience.","Kong, oh my taste buds! This place, let me tell you, transcends mere dining ‚Äì it's a gastronomic odyssey! The moment you step in, flavor fireworks explode in your mouth like a culinary supernova. The food? A symphony of taste! Each dish is a masterpiece, elevating mere ingredients to divine status. I've never tasted anything so exquisite in my life! The ambiance? Picture this: you're dining on clouds, serenaded by angels strumming harps made of flavor. The service? Impeccable! Their waitstaff is like a squad of flavor ninjas, stealthily attending to your every need before you even know you have it. I haven't eaten there yet, but I just know it's the kind of place that would make food critics weep with joy and turn fast-food aficionados into fine dining connoisseurs. Trust me, you'll want to bring your taste buds here for a VIP experience they'll never forget!","We had a wonderful meal here tonight. The service was perfect at keeping an eye on us while at the same time not unnecessarily interrupting

The food was wonderful. The tuna tartar appetizer was a favorite as well as the short rib. Oh, and don't miss the chocolate fondant

And the interior is beautifully designed with soft sofa style seats that make you want to spend all evening chatting here"

Waiter Bagus was very attentive and made us feel taken care of.","by the advice of my childhood friend, I came to try the food at this restaurant,
the food looks great and prawns scramble is SO delicious! hot chocolate is good (no sugar!!), my best recommendationsüëåüèΩ","Stunning atmosphere with stunning food.
Japanese fusion menu was super tasty.
Great selection of sake, wine and Japanese whiskey and gin. I don't see them anywhere else in bali or even in japan. Must to go!
Totally recommend it. I suggest to put your most favorite stylish outfit.","Without a doubt, an amazing dining expirience ! I ordered delicious crispy eggplant and tuna tataki with incredible sauce for the start. It was great. But the highlight of the dinner was the duck with a glass of French wine. It was amazing, highly recommend that combo! I would especially like to note the stunning design and musical atmosphere! great work guys!","When i first went there, i was blown away by the interior. Well thought out seating and very intricate lighting. The atmosphere was amazing with the music and vinyl collection adding so much depth to the vibe of the area.

The service however was slightly lacking. The floor staff are inattentive and look lost in general, not on the ball to say the least. We took a while before we could order despite giving multiple signals to be given a 'wait' ..

The food will take some time to arrive but i believe the wait was worth it. Their cocktail crafts were amazing too and i wanted to try everything! But once again the food was so good it was so hard to decide a favourite dish of the night.

All in all if you're willing to wait, it will be a great culinary experience as the head chef gives it his all and it reflects in the quality of the dishes.

Will definitely return."

When we arrived there was no one at the front desk (if you could call it that). We hadn‚Äôt been told how to enter the property so I had to walk around and ask random men on the street if they knew ew which villa it was and how to get in as the contact number provided wasn‚Äôt being answered.
When we entered, we immediately noticed the pool was dirty. You could not see the bottom of the pool with how murky and unclean it was.
There was mould and limescale build up in all of the bathrooms, the toilets weren‚Äôt cleaned, smells of sewage, the bedding was covered with stains and hairs. The kitchen floors hadn‚Äôt been cleaned as there were food spills, cigarette butts and dirt everywhere. There was no drinking water available. We advised the staff that we weren‚Äôt comfortable staying due to the cleanliness and lack of drinkable water and requested a refund. The property stopped responding to our messages and calls, even when we went past the front desk to speak to them. Everyone had apparently left so they didn‚Äôt need to deal with the situation.
The property are now refusing to refund us almost $1000AUD despite us not being able to stay there for our health and safety.","One of the worst situations I‚Äôve ever been in. Staff was great, the owner on the other hand was terrible. During the pandemic I don‚Äôt know if or when I will get a job, four days into my month stay I found out I will leave. I asked the owner and they said that because I paid the full month I cannot have any of my money back. I stayed a total of six days and had to pay almost one thousand dollars. I will never ever recommend this place to anyone. Stealing money from people during a pandemic is low. The room was nice enough but very dated, old paint, old wood, old. It‚Äôs unfortunate because like most Balinese people the staff were very nice. You can find a lot better places than this. I wouldn‚Äôt trust them.",Nice pool and decent size villa. Very private in a somewhat remote location. It is 20 minutes by taxi to Seminyak Square. Food in the restaurant and the service in the spa is good but not great. Staff were friendly and courteous. Lacking a wow factor but would certainly not be unhappy about staying here again.,One of the best villa I have stayed it so far. Everything is great. One of the best thing I liked about this place is the staff of the hotel. They were very nice people. And I loved my staying over here. Restaurant is pretty good as well and the cook is very nice too. He understand the requirements of the customers food.,"Super cozy and quiet place to live. Villas are nice, spacious and clean.

There were 9 of us and it was quiet and so relaxing. Staff are so beautiful and the food was great at Happy Buddha restaurant. My son celebrated a birthday and the chef made him a special pancake breakfast without being asked. Our Villa was cleaned everyday and the pool was great to relax in and swim in. There was the filtered fresh water cooler stand in our villa which was great. I visited Bali 25years ago and traffic has increased, restaurants are everywhere and the markets have improved. We walked to restaurants every night and yeah the roads don‚Äôt have footpaths but we did, lol. With my phone l found all the places to eat with menus and reviews. So much better now than 25yrs ago.","My husband and I visited Villa Besar for the second time, and once again, we were thoroughly impressed. The value for money is unbeatable ‚Äì including airport transfers, a delicious cooked breakfast, wonderful villas, and, above all, incredibly helpful and friendly staff. One of the things we appreciate about Villa Besar is its peaceful location, away from the hustle of busy streets yet conveniently close to all essential amenities. Without a doubt, we plan to return again. :)","Beautiful place with great staff. Perfect privacy in every way.  Away from the bustle, but still close enough to get anywhere.  Breakfast included is great, too.  Fab place!","We love it here and have stayed a few times now. From the owners Mike and Jenny to each of the amazing staff we always feel welcomed and taken care of. Everything is done professionally and the service, cleanliness, facilities, inclusions and the whole process is seamless and fantastic. The villas are beautifully kept and we love the location.","Villa Besar is a set of so called villas: private areas with several bedrooms, garden and pool. Or villa #4 had 6 bedrooms (all with private bathroom) for 12 or more persons, one large living room and 2 smaller sitting / dining areas. The place is gigantic and gave more than enough space and privacy for all of us.
Around the villa there's numer of shops, cafes and restaurants, however it's not the best walking district as the street is busy, with no pavement. Taking a cab or ordering food by grab or gojek works very smoothly.
The staff was very helpful and nice. Always happy to assist, there were some services included in the stay such as laundry or airport pickup.
It's been a great stay and I'm looking forward to come back."

I initially wanted to have pancakes, but got curious about the coconut syrniky so had to try! It was presented very nicely and served with fruits, strawberry jam and coconut sauce, and a fruit juice. I liked it: tasty and not too sweet. The ginger tea was also good, made with fresh ginger and spices. I went back a few times, and everything I ordered was good (chicken wrap, dadar gulung, banana pancakes, espresso, smashed avocado toasts with poached eggs). The restaurant has two floors, which both have a nice atmosphere, and it is possible to sit at tables or at counters overlooking the street. All staff members are very friendly. All of that for a great price. I will definitely go back. Terima kasih to the team!","Very very tasty! food, service, staff! Everything about this establishment is great!",A really nice place with good prices! We have been there a few times already and we enjoyed the food each time. It‚Äôs also served very quickly. Highly recommended!,"This is definitely one of my favorite places in Canggu. The food is delicious and they have lots of healthy options here. The staff is super friendly and they always find a solution for whatever you ask for. I‚Äôm very picky and usually ask to change this particular ingredient with another one and they always respond positively and do it perfectly. I feel really special every time üòá

Sometimes I dine in, sometimes I take away and in both scenarios the staff doing their job amazingly good üëçüèª And it‚Äôs so cool that in the morning you can get a yummy cappuccino with your breakfast just for +15K ü§©
