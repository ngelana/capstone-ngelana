The first time we ordered the jackfruit, the risotto, dumplings and the sweet potato medallions. We were not impressed. However the second time we ordered the gnocchi, the ravioli, the veggie meatballs and the organic salad and it was a completely different experience. The gnocchi and the ravioli were amazing! We also had the warm apple pie - also great. They also serve mocktails, which are also very good. I would revisit, given the great second experience.","We had an incredibly lovely time in Hai Ri Zen. The place is just perfect for a sunset cocktail to start your sumptuous dinner. My favourite dish there  was the Gnocchi. It was really nicely cooked and I had to order it every time we went there and I even have extra sauce to fully enjoy the mix of potato and cheese. I would also suggest trying the Potato Leek Soup and the Seafood Chowder. They also conjure a mean Risotto which you can order by itself or you can also have a taste of it by ordering the Seasonal dish. You can then top the dinner off with their Classic Baked Lemon Cheese Cake which was really good. They also have a good selection of cocktails and wines. I would surely suggest my fave - Irish Cream Martini. The food was really good and filling and you‚Äôll also receive amazing service from their friendly staff who are very attentive. Kudos to Gita and their manager Junnie for their hospitality.

We went there for 4 dinners over the 7-day stay we had in Nusa Lembongan. Having my Hai Ri Zen experience surely makes me want to go back there again.

And Fanny the waitress was awesome. It‚Äôs not cheap and you can get good food for less coin elsewhere- You pay close to Aussie prices for it but for a top quality meal this place is well worth the money. I recommend 100%,"We had a fabulous dinner at Hai Ri Zen.  Obviously the view is spectacular.   The decor is beautiful ,  the food was superb and our lovely waitress, Ayu,  gave us wonderful service.   Thoroughly recommended.    We‚Äôll be back","This place is a must visit!

Cute and cozy. Matcha latte is very delicious (a bit too sweet but that‚Äôs okay). They also have plant-based milk for vegans and those with lactose intolerance. Staff and baristas are friendly too :),"Wild juices experience; they are something else. They also customise what you want; I went for poached eggs and mashed avocado and ordered a bacon, mozzarella and egg sandwich on delicious bread; the service was super friendly when they changed the sandwich first because it came with bacon, and we ordered without, then we ordered a Hail Mary juice, which was fantastic too.

The location is superb, overlooking the bay, and the ambience inside is quite lovely. Service was top notch, prices were maybe a bit on the high side, plus they include a hefty gratuity and tax. The fish and chips were quite delicious, and It was a birthday dinner so well worth it.","I had to ask to be served, people that had come after me had been served.

The staff are friendly and helpful. The accommodation is run down and needs a little work but its manageable. The room is fine, the bathroom is terrible. But a lovely place to sit in the evening for a juice and watch the sunset.","The 2 men on reception have terrible customer service. We had been waiting at the bar for over an hour, we spoke to them and they told us the bar would be open at 1pm (we had been here since 12pm), by now it was 1.30pm so I went back to the reception to ask the guys if anyone was opening the bar, they then said 2pm it would be open and then laughed about it saying the bartender is probably sleeping. Poor service. Would not go here again.","Dirty. Loose toilet seat, no toilet lid. We wanted to have a glass of wine, unfortunately you could only pay cash at the bar and not even a bill to the room is possible - the glass of wine was thrown away in front of our eyes - outrageous.","Mushroom Beach Bungalows is good value for a beach side property. What I love about it, is the local ownership and the attentive staff. The food and drinks are very reasonably priced, far better than the more $$ places down the beach.  The room I had did not have a fridge or a safe, that is my only downside but I am still giving it 5 stars, as it‚Äôs so worth the price per night. You won‚Äôt regret staying here as it‚Äôs cozy, not too many rooms and the staff treats you like family. Wayan the manager, Indra and Yoga are the best!! The views from the restaurant are stunning! Many people from along the beach who are staying at other properties come for drinks and dinner at sunset. I almost hate to give this a 5 star, as more people will know about this wonderful little property. If you are in Nusa Lembongan you must stay here!","Right on the beach in Mushroom Bay, this place has a lovely pool and excellent rooms with communicative and friendly staff. There is a resident turtle that pops in quite often at breakfast time. Can recommend for families with kids as there are one or two rooms that have inter-leading doors."

You can let your kids play and run without worrying as this place is HUGE! Jyo met other two kids here, they were too shy at the beginning  but ended up playing together. xD

I dont feel the need to go outside this place as i got everything i need here. Sunrise with Mount Agung view and amazing sunset at the beach which is just one step outside. Not to mention super friendly and helpful staff also amaaaazing food.Totally spoiled !","Le Nusa Beach club was awesome! Great location and amazing ocean views. Infinity pool is good! Rooms and bathrooms were clean and comfortable. Staff is very helpful and polite, we booked our snorkling and nusa penida tour with them and they offered great prices.

Food menu needs an upgrade and more vegetarian options. Nevertheless there are great places to eat right next to the resort on the beach.","Absolutely incredible!!! location, staff and price are all amazing. we were lucky enough to elope here with the beautiful views and laid back vibes! the staff did absolutely everything to make our day so perfectüòç would 100% recommend to anyone",Restaurant has amazing views and location. Food average with extremely small portions and 3 times more expensive than other places away from the beach.,"The location of Le Nusa is amazing, & with the choice of two pools and easy beach access, it‚Äôs hard to beat.
The rooms aren‚Äôt new, but have plenty of Balinese character and charm.
The breakfast is the best inclusive breakfast we‚Äôve had, which is always a plus. Staff are really lovely and deserve all the tips. üôåüèºüíïüå¥‚òÄÔ∏èü•≠üå∫
You can use the snorkelling gear for free, which is awesome!
Only gave four stars as the bed we have sags a little and pillows weren‚Äôt super comfy. Still managed to sleep well after all the swimming and snorkelling."

I wish them all the best and highly recommend to anyone looking for some delicious traditional food üòÅ","Delicious seafood Laksa with amazing prawns and calamari. High quality and fresh taste. As a guest of Naradas next door, I decided to try the restaurant one evening. It blew me away. My favourite food and most peaceful atmosphere I've experienced on Lembongan, you feel you're eating in a family home with the semi-open kitchen, you can see the owners cooking and preparing floral offering baskets for the next day. I highly recommend this place and I would love to taste more of the menu if I had more time (the Japanese selection looks great, as well as the seafood).","Great food, very kind people. Everything we ate was great and inexpensive. Highly recommended!","We had a super quick lunch here before heading off - we had a boat to catch in 20 min, and they were able to get our order out to us in 10.

The seafood laksa was so good - light creamy broth, well balanced spices, and a very generous serving of ingredients.

We inhaled our food in under 10 min!"

Rooms were lovely, two pools, one of which we very often had to ourselves. Food is delicious and the view is beautiful. We travelled with our five month old daughter and the staff were so kind to us, often looking after her for us when we were eating. Would highly recommend, especially for families",The roof leaked water on our bed and face when it rained! Found bird poo on bed and room everyday. No staff were available after 8.30pm ! When something happened in the property we had to call many times and had to wait a long time for them to finally arrive. The bed mattress wire frame was completely broken and should have thrown away long time ago when we complained they didn‚Äôt offer any solutions. When looking for accommodation on the island definitely go somewhere else you will a lot less and get a lot more for your money,"Stayed at Bay Shore Huts and really liked it. The location is great close to Mushroom Beach, the room was spacious and clean, staff was very attentive and like all people we encountered just a beautiful holiday. Great places to check out and eat all kinds of food and surrounding places to visit are just breath taking.","I give this place 5 stars because we love it. Our favourite place we visit for or trip. We stayed 2 nights last year, 4 nights this time next time will be a week. Room are cleaned daily, they are very comfortable. If you leave a light on outside you will be lucky enough to see the gecko's.  But you will hear them chirping away at night. That's the country feel we like about this place. Lovely food and seating overlooking the sea topped of with wonderful staff.","Loved our peaceful stay at Bay Shore Huts. Beautiful little huts with air conditioning and fan. Very pretty scenery and gardens. Great view of the ocean and Mount Agung. Great location easy to get to mushroom bay and can scooter everywhere else. I recommend staying here! Reasonably priced, huge comfortable beds and daily room service."

We stayed there for 4 nights (unfortunatelly) in March 2024. We saw rats in the breakfast room. The bathroom is disgusting. We had a mouse at night coming to our room and other insects as well. There's a permanent bad smell in the toilet. Towels are dirty and smelly. We cleaned it to be able to use the toilet but we could never get rid of the stink. Our first impression was so bad that we asked if we could cancel our booking. We stayed in cheap accomodation before, but this one is not cheap, it's horrible. The person in reception said that we could not cancel our booking without contacting the owner of the place. Of course, he/she was not there. Because we paid in advance for 4 nights, we did not take the risk to lose our money, so we decided to stay. We decided to be in that place as little as possible. Leaving before 9am, coming back at 10pm just to sleep in the stinky room. The staff is kind enough but does not make the stay better. Breakfast is just basic. The view is also not worth it because as soon as you leave the place, you can see all the rabbish around it. We did not use the pool to not risk our health. Definitely, the owner does not invest in the place and staff. Please, don't waste your money and bother your holidays. We found just near to that place other better villas and accomodations for better price and food. Believe me, don't make the same mistake than us. Proximity to the beach, in this case, it's not worth it.","The pictures are clearly very old, I had read some new reviews but they didn't prepare me to what I encountered. The ""hotel"" is at the end of a long dirt road, and not known by the 100s of drivers on the island, so you constantly need to explain yourself. The pool was dirty of tree debree (bringing a bunch of mosquitos with it) and the edge-of-pool bar is not there anymore, so forget that atmosphere. The ""beach"" cannot be defined as such, since the tide goes so high to reach the wall of the garden, making it impossible to walk on a ""beach"", plus it's sadly dirty with plastic residue all over, I didn't even want to put my feet in. All of this without mentioning the giant semi abandoned black 4-story construction site looming over the garden and blocking any possible view of the sunset. Going to the bungalows, cute on the outside but. Inside you notice there is a total of 2 plugs, in random places of the room - if you wish to charge your device and have your alarm next to you, you gotta pick - but that is just poor space management, not a big deal. The main issue is with the bed canopy cover: disgustingly dirty. I would expect some dust debree from the wood roof, but not stains and dead insects in both the fabric bed-roof and the mosquito nets around. I didn't dare closing them. Overall all of it can be overlooked if you are an easy traveler. The thing that made it all just not pleasant was the lack of customer service. The young guys taking care of the place are nice but they clearly couldn't care less about the place or the fact that you are their guest. Such a shame, the place could be great with a little more love. All in all, I'm not sure if it was worth the (cheap) price, as all over bali I kept the same budget but got way better experiences - including in hostels! - a travel used to mud huts and wildlife camping, who was hoping for a more relaxing experience -","GreaT place for location, service & cheap accommodation. Bungalows aren't perfect. But clean, big room & bathroom. Service is good. Breakfast is minimal, but location to shops, other resorts & Mushroom beach is great!!","At $25/nt for standard room - the location, service & functional large room & bathroom was great. Not 5*, but 3* - so room isnt perfect, but large, clean, air-con cool & functional to sleep, change & go out again. The pool was great. Breakfast was sparce, but nice cup of tea!! Many places to eat very close by. Very close walk to Mushroom Beach to safely swim, eat at resorts & enjoy the beauty of Nusa Lembongan. All good!","I hope there should be an option for ZERO star.
Worst hotel ever, no proper entrance, bugs all over, broken swimming pool, only one staff handling everything, no table chair in room, broken bed, dirty and smelly bed sheets, dirty bathroom, spider net in room, look like haunted place.
Very disappointed, please don‚Äôt believe on posted pictures of hotel, its only magic of camera‚Ä¶.
In reality, hotel is VERY BAD.
I would not recommend it even in free of cost."
