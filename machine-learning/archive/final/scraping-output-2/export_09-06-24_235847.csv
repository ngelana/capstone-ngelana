The food and drinks are very tasty and traditional. The view is simply amazing! Looking at the green rice fields, time slows down and the sight is truly peaceful. If you want a really local and very special experience, I recommend visiting this place. The extreme kindness and hospitality of the villagers is also special.","Best chicken sat√©s I've had in Indonesia ‚ù§Ô∏è
Staff was super friendly and generous üôÇ
The view amazing üòç

The fries are exactly perfection, like Belgian fries. Fresh potatoes and perfectly fried.

I would highly recommend this place to everyone and I recommend to the owner to change the name on the menu to belgian fries instead of ""french"" fries, people will not hesitate to order them üòÑüôèüèº","This is an trully oasis in such a touristic place - good prices, good meal, quite location amazing service and stunning view. Definitely will come back next time and recommend to my friends to visit.","Such an amazing place with delicious food.
Probably the most delicious food we ate in Bali, overlooking picturesque rice fields.

The food was delicious, the portions were plentiful, and the service was very friendly, offering free tea, water, peanuts, and watermelon. Serving real fresh juice.","Amazing little gem hidden between some rice fields, with a stunning authentic view. You gotta keep an eye out for the roadsigns, because the path to enter is either between two buildings, or at the end of the village and around the buildings, along the rice paddies.

The two guys working there definetly made us feel comfortable with our little baby daughter. We were lucky to arrive and stay there the entire stay alone. So humbling.

We got refreshments for free as a compliment, and great service.
We enjoyed the bbq ribs with fries, and double up for both on the watermelon juice! Give us more!

We are already planing to come back tomorrow.

Prices are great, staff is great, the ricefield view is top."
