The rooms were so clean & the view outside our room was just beautiful. Frank & his staff made us feel so so welcome & they lit a fireplace for us at night. I wish we could have stayed longer.
We will definitely be coming back here soon",,,,

It worth the long drive, because it's a nice and cozy place, with a surprising cheap price.

The coffee is really good and the burger is nice. The owner welcome us with warm conversation. Knows a lot about the neighborhood too.

Should you strolling around at Kintamani, you might wanna stop by for a cup of coffee..",Very good food European stile! And I d find veg food. And it was very kind to organise delivery to our nearby hotel because of rains all our clothes was wet. Thanks for chef ❤️,Had a good time here. Food taste good. And they have games and a guitar! Nice place surrounding. Lake and a park.,Coffees came with the food so we waited 25 minutes. Cappuccino was not great. View from the restaurant is not bad. But we were approached by two people trying to sell us their `art work` in the restaurant.,"Propably the cheapest and best food I had in Bali. Very high quality and really nice waiter. I am surprised at how much burger with fries you get for 18K. Only complaint was that the farm next door was spreading manure and there was a stench and a million flies. Supposedly this is only a couple of weeks a year, but I hope they will prepare better for fly season next time."
