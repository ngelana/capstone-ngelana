The bed is comfortable, the air condition strong, the location is perfect and the owner is incredibly friendly.
Located right next to a rice field and far away enough from the main road this place is quiet and serene. Mejan Beach with its glittering black sand is just a 5 minute walk away, perfect to enjoy that sunset. Balian Beach is also just a 15-20 walk away, or a 3 minute scooter ride.
Putu, the owner, has made this stay memorable with her kind and loving soul, taking great care of the house and it‚Äôs guest alike. Would 100% recommend and stay again!","This place is really wonderful, peaceful ü§©

Putu wellcomes you with a great attention, she is very available and attentive.
You are in the middle of rice fields, with some cute animals (puppies, ducks, chicken, cows‚Ä¶but rooms are absolutely quiet !), just 200 meters from the sea.

Rooms are very cleaned and comfortable, with hot water and AC.

That‚Äôs was perfect, thanks again Putu !","We arrived after a long trip and owner says the Homestay is not in Agoda.

Sent proof and she said she doesn‚Äôt receive the booking.

Sent proof and she said that there is an agent, a bug in Agoda, blah blah

Ah now the place is in Agoda.

Politely she point us to book another place and this is not her fault or her business.

Ridiculous","Cozy place, clean, quiet and I like the sounds all the frog in the rice field in front of it and chilling in the pool with puppies!",This place its very nice comfortable quite and also full of memories with him. How many time im going there never bored. Very recomended.

We spent a fabulous holiday here. The open and serene space is such a hidden gem. Incredibly intimate and private. The friendly and highly professional staff goes out of their way to anticipate and answer our needs. Will recommend!,"Really incredible villa in one of the quieter areas of Bali, close to quiet surf beach with Volcanic sands and awesome seafood. Highly recommended for intimate family or group holidays.",,"This is the third time we have spent a week at Villa JuJu.  There is everything I like here. The beach is 150m away and is mostly deserted and huge.  There are a few restaurants within walking distance but I also like to cook in this open kitchen which overlooks the garden and the swimming pool and it is a real pleasure to shop in the small shops along the main road of the village.  The staff is very nice and especially Wayan who helped us a lot to organize outings.  The +: There are 2 massage benches and the masseuse comes on site.  Ask for Ilu, she's great.
The villa is located in amazing nature, rice fields and lovely cows that look like deer.
We will surely come back.",Beautiful property. Great staff.
