Kids were learning and experience a lot of new stuff relate to nature and ecosystem conservation. As an adult, i enjoyed the activities too. Super friendly, helpful and professional facilitators are ready to guide and help you. Amazing facilities, excellent programs, healthy and delicious food and unforgettable experience. Totally worth it!!","Nothing good here for learning in this new world except insect bites and sleepless nights. You could get them for free.
Lousy old bus that they claimed envoronm friendly what a tourist trap.
Cellphone not allowed (maybe 10-15min a day) worse than prison.
I dont understand why did the school send them here. Most parents were uninformed. And they made it mandatory for their academic  grades.
The children were motivated to be excited for this trip by their marketing pictures.

I hope this review helps. And most parents could save money in these tough times.

Bbs parent","It had everything I was looking for when I signed up for green camp.
- Quality time with my child
- getting to know other parents
- exposing my city kid to more nature and less screen time.

Mosquitoes are a given but it’s survivable and after a week, you won’t remember them. But you will remember green camp for a long time.

Also book yourself a nice hotel and dinner after you check out!",Awesome green camp!! Had so much fun family Bonding activities!! Highly recommended for family with young children as well to appreciate nature and balinese culture!!,"Very cool place... an educational place that can provide inspiration for anyone.

Unique bamboo building, super inspiring toilet. Everything returns to nature.

Schools, offices and anyone need to study here to be applied in the place where they live"

Plus Pak is really nice.
You'll pay double that in Ubud for something generally cold, tasteless, in a warung dedicated to tourists.
