ChIJ75NhnGgZ0i0RlFYOtWpwopI,Eco Six Bali,-8.4384899,115.3108812,"Eco Six Bali, Jl. Raya Ayodya, Tampaksiring, Kec. Tampaksiring, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80552, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=10566131279371064980,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3949-4923,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.5,95,,"Eco Six Bali was such an amazing experience, we really enjoyed it. We stayed in the Moon Room and the pictures don't do it justice, it is such a beautiful and peaceful place.

The sitting room was cozy, the bedroom was spacious and the bathroom was the perfect size. Views or the rice field and jungles were lovely and the pool is a good size with a slide that is quite fast but fun.

The service was impeccable, the team is very responsive, friendly, and accommodating.

We used a driver through them Didi who was also excellent and we got massages to with Nina who provided one of the best massages I have ever had.

You won't be disappointed booking Eco Six, it is a great place to stay.","I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to extend my heartfelt thanks for the exceptional hospitality during our recent stay at your hotel.Our experience was truly outstanding from start to finish. The accommodations were comfortable and well-appointed, the service was impeccable, and the staff was incredibly attentive and friendly.
We thoroughly enjoyed our time and appreciate all the efforts your team made to ensure our stay was memorable. Please convey our gratitude to everyone involved.
We look forward to returning in the future and will certainly recommend your hotel to friends and family.","The price is not worth the experience to me, I didn't sleep that night when I stayed here the bed was not comfortable at all and the breakfast was pretty mediocre, plus from the morning all you hear Is the bikes from the street, total nightmare.

Only the service was good.

I wish all the best to the owner and I hope he accepts criticism as a way to improve the mistakes in his business.","My wife and I couldn't have had a more perfect experience with Eco Six for our first time in Bali. The breakfast and fresh Juice every morning was amazing. It was never too hot inside, and the view was always amazing at sunrise and sunset. The staff was so friendly and was very attentive, we both also had a great couple massage. When we go back to Bali will definitely want to stay there again.","My husband and I came down with food poisoning on the night we arrived at eco six after ordering room service by the kitchen and we were careful to only drink bottled water throughout our trip in Bali.

Apart from the food poisoning incident, the location of the villa in general is not great: the nearest established restaurants, cafes, clinics, are at least 30 minutes away by car. We couldn‚Äôt get anyone to deliver our order on Grab mart as the location was simply too far away.

The rooms in the villa are separated from the outside roads by a narrow lane and fence and the noise from the motorcycles could be heard all day long which is especially annoying as we were trying to get some rest in the early morning.

We were slightly disappointed by the pool above our villa which is actually tub-sized so you can‚Äôt really move around in it much. We couldn‚Äôt soak for long because the water was too cold. The staff did tell us to be careful when coming up from the pool because the perimeter structure holding it is not safe to step on. We also had to be extra careful not to step onto the nails that were protruding out of the floor around the pool.

And while the room is generally well-maintained, we still found a few ants crawling on the bed and the bath tub. But what was slightly more concerning was that we found a half bitten dead snake covered in ants right outside our room. The staff was kind enough to help us remove the carcass.

On a positive note, the staff at eco six were very helpful and constantly checked in on us upon hearing that my husband was down with food poisoning. They even offered a complimentary cake as an apology and a free ride on their scooter to the nearby convenience store to grab some supplies.

Overall not a great place to stay if you value convenience, cleanliness, and hygiene."

Amazing tour & service & explanation üôå Definitely a must experience & the Luwak coffee is very special and actually it tastes pretty good! Wish prices to buy coffee were a little cheaper and also having smaller portion options for great gift ideas‚ú®,"Beautiful experience. Staff were super incredibly lovely, warm and welcoming. Their English was really good and they were very knowledgeable. The tour was short and sweet and we got to meet wild friendly Luwaks. This was our favourite thing we did in Ubud. Free coffee and tea tasting with banana chips. We loved all of the teas and coffees! Awesome!",Very interesting coffee and tea tasting experience. Got to pat the civet cat as well. The swing was awesome.,"A wonderful place and a unique experience. We took a tour around the farm, which has a variety of crops and the animal that produces the unique coffee. We tried all the different coffee flavors and did the swing ‚Äì it was amazing.","It was wonderful trying wide range of organic coffee flavors. It has the soul of nature and one luwak coffee completely made my day boost. You can also be able to see the LUWAK(the nocturnal cat which is used for manufacturing the coffee). Lina was a wonderful host, she made us taste like 20 different coffees. MUST VISITTT in Bali‚ù§Ô∏è"

Had amazing and unique experiences here. Mary the dog is really cute üòä and the hotel manager is such a character.",Absolutely amazing place! I had everything I needed and more while on my stay in the NYX jungles and it was awesome!!! I love this place and hope it will be even better next time! Love you NYX fam!,"This place is awesome! Aside from being nestled in a beautiful area, the bamboo housing structures are a dream to stay in. You get  to live close to nature with the comfort of a modern room. Waking up with the sounds of the birds, insects and beautiful rice field and jungle views.

The community and events held here really make it feel like you're part of a family. I highly recommend coming to stay at the NYX.","The NYX is absolutely amazing!  Come here and you will certainly feel at home. I experienced the best community living involvement in. There are artists, managers, chefs, scientists, engineers: it's a really sociable environment. Great for solo travellers who are looking for ideas and inspirations. It worth it a long stay for sure. I've been here for almost two weeks only leaving due to visa expiring, otherwise I'd stay as long as possible.
I would definitely recommend it not only for the social vibe but also for the stunning views of rice fields. This is a lovely place where easily I could meditate or do yoga surrounded by the sounds of nature and jungle.
The location it's really close to lots of touristic attractions (waterfalls, rice terraces, temples) and to Ubud city center.","This place is physically incredible and has some of the nicest and most inspiring people I've met.

What I especially appreciate is the warmth and openness of the community. Though many people have been staying at the NYX as long as a year, they are just as open to newcomers as the people who have been staying at the NYX for a single weekend.

The space just breeds creativity. I love being there and highly recommend others to go and stay!

PS: The VR set up is DOPE!"
