It‚Äôs been here since 1994 and has an entire sustainable business model. The eat-in has no wifi and was pretty quiet whenever I went. Kitchen was busy with delivery orders. 5 stars for the business as whole, we need more places like this.

Veg, vegan, and gluten-free options labeled. They were sold out of their gluten-free sunshine bread the whole week so unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get to try what I wanted. If you‚Äôre GF maybe give a call ahead to see if the bread is stocked! Bakery & natural store attached.

I enjoyed the drinks: matcha latte (coconut milk) and golden milk latte (coconut milk), food could have been better. GF breakfast wrap was nice. The cooked/marinated tempeh (in the tempeh salad) was amazing. Fresh springs rolls were literally only lettuce, noodles, tofu, would skip for the price.","Loved the sustainable practices..using leaves as coaster, natural cutlery, local ingredients.....
Menu in newspaper format is so cute. Lots of options for Vegan and vegetarian, even in the bakery menu
Loved the food taste and presentation!","WAY BETTER THAN ORDERING ONLINE! Their menu is a newspaper, so many vegan options, smoothies, pizza, pasta‚Ä¶ very yummy. Their restaurant is in a shop and you can buy many natural products there (natural vegan deodorant, toothpaste, cookies‚Ä¶)","I don‚Äôt recommend this place, at least if u order diner options. the portions are very small and my salad had like 4 leaves and the rest was toasted coconut flakes which made the salad very sweet and lack substance. I also got ravioli with was better but very basic. Overall the food is over priced and not that good. Don‚Äôt trust the other reviews, i promise.

Love the shredded chicken ,  but not the ayam merah (old hen)  where the meat is kind of hard .

The price is surprisingly cheap , only IDR25k for the plate we ordered . A great place to try out nasi campur .","The food is really good, the only issue is that there isn't any parking for cars. Also, they rarely have any sate/satay when I visit.","Maybe my expectations were a bit too high because of the Bu Oki name. They were out of sate lilit, and I found the chicken to be of low quality.

The negative point is the noise. Between the room is perfect but with outside...Our room was the nearest of the street. They should change the window to have a better soundproofing.

The photos do make it look a little more insta-friendly than it is. Saying that there were some great bits about this place.

Swimming pool the garden feels really calm, we loved using it. It‚Äôs mostly in the shade in the morning and then sun in the afternoon, they have parasols so always shade available. It felt really clean and the day we left there were pool cleaners in for a deep clean.

We read a review in advance that the rooms were noisy‚Ä¶ we took the risk anyway.
Frankly, we thought it was great. We were about three rooms back from the road, which like all Bali roads, iwas pretty busy morning to night. But the road noise did not stop us sleeping well. In previous places we have stayed on our trip the street dogs barking and fighting and the cockerels crowing throughout the night definitely interrupted our sleep on manu occasions, but not at the UTube Hotel. Probably some of our best nights sleep ! The bed was also super comfy.

Shower: hot water and very powerful - best shower of the trip.

Drinking water available all the time, small detail but so useful.

Staff were really friendly.

Cleanliness definitely a priority for them, and the daily housekeeping was an added bonus.

FYI payments only in cash upon arrival.

In terms of lower price places available, with a pool, we were really happy with this üòÉ we stayed for 6 nights.

Id say the only negative would be that we didn‚Äôt love the name üòÇ

The food is amazing! A lot of seafood, big portions, all dishes can be no-spicy if you ask so.

The onion rings were fresh, crispy and handmade. The mozarella sticks and crispy tempeh were also good!
A must try here is the curry (I had the fish curry with tuna - there was a whole tuna steak in there üòçüëç) and the black pepper dishes (chicken in my case). The prices are really low and the kitchen is very fast in preparing all dishes. The chicken cordon bleu and beef salad weren't our favorites but still really good.
A definite must try when you are in Uluwatu.","Very friendly service from the owner and staff.

Came here due to the reviews, however food was below average, and not up to the standards of south east Asians. Tried beef fried rice, chicken mee goreng and long beans with tofu and tempe. We had to complement it with chilli padi 'birds eye chili' to add some flavor.

Think that they cater more to white tourists who would like to explore the regional cuisine, without the spiciness that makes it authentic.","Love this place, food is amazing portion size is really good and the staff here are so so nice.

The experience was excellent from start to finish. The bed was extremely comfortable, providing us with peaceful nights of sleep. Having breakfast served in the room was a special touch, allowing us to start the day in comfort and privacy.

The pool was clean and very pleasant, ideal for moments of leisure and relaxation. The accommodations were impeccably clean, and the large bathtub was perfect for a relaxing bubble bath.

The staff were very friendly and welcoming, always ready to assist and make our stay even more enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a tranquil and comfortable place to rest. We will definitely be back!","It was a pretty disappointing experience.

The rooms were not properly clean, a lot of furniture was broken and the room amenities are lacking. To cook you do not have a cutting board or proper knife, just a cooking plate and one damaged pan. The broken furniture we noticed included the curtains, the bed curtains, the sun chairs, the normal chairs, and the cooking ware.

Additionally, you only get one towel in the bathroom and when we asked for more they were nicely given by the reception staff but taken away by housekeeping every time. The soap was also not refilled once.

It mostly seems the hotel is outdated and the owners are too cheap to fix it. We paid 6+ million rupiah for five nights, that is a lot of money and we expect the room to be in a good status for that price.

The staff, however, were super friendly. This is the only reason the review is still 2 stars instead of 1.","We were pretty dissapointed with the stay here. The Villa looks much better on pictures than in real life. Firstly we checked in to the executive Villa which had the whole bathroom outside. A lot of spiders and so on in there and the shower was rusty, baththub not even properly cleaned. After talking to the staff we were able to move into a smaller villa which was already cleaner but still a bit dirty. The shower especially was dirty and the lavabo was clucked. All in all it was really just okay, dont go here if you expect a bit of luxury in a nice little getaway.

Staff was always friendly and helped with everything. Location is also quite central to explore Uluwatu.","Sorry to give you 1 star, i haven't stay in the villa so i won't coment about that BUT the customer service really terrible and not professional.. I booked for 6 nights through agoda and paid in full because one of reason i need to cancel my booking and get full refund FYI i booked one month in advance so its not like i cancel it last minute. I understand the policy as they wanted 50% refund that's why i tried to contact the property and explain everything, i tried filling the form and explain my condition but they decline 6/7 times and i want my 50% money nearly $200 i tried 6/7 times to apply through agoda but they decline. I tried to email the property email address myself twice but no replies at all.... I just want to say i disappointed with the customer service communications in this property i won't book with them in the future, IF YOU WANT TO BOOK THE PROPERTY PLEASE THINK WITH YOUR OWN RISK and 1000% sure because if anything happens they will ignore you as long as they get the money they won't help at all. At the end i cancel it my self and lost 50% of my money even though i tried to communicate and explain everything.","Stunning villas! That offer a beautiful floating breakfast for only 100k.

There were no dedicated servers on the second floor, so I had to go downstairs to place my order. After waiting for about an hour, the waiter informed us that our order couldn't be served due to running out of stock (grilled carp). However, my grilled carp arrived 10 minutes later. It seems there was a lack of communication among the staff. The chili sauces here are delicious, and the spiciness is quite pronounced. The food is also tasty, but it's the poor quality of service that affects the overall experience.

Umpteen varieties of Sambal to choose from. We tasted the green (hot) and red w onion and tomato. Unbelievably good. The grilled chicken thigh and calamari are a must.

1. The staff
They are really nice and friendly to me and my husband. They are very helpful.

2. The room is clean and smell so good. They have room service as well. If you plan to stay longer, they are willing to clean your room every day.

Highly recommend to try their mutton biryani","Delicious cuisine, I‚Äôve gotten the chicken biryani and Butter chicken. Spice is perfect to western standard, low.

Both times, the food was excellent - even by Indian restaurant & food standards.

Not too spicy and full of flavour.

While dining in, staff was super attentive and food came quickly. They were also quick to suggest a dal-khichadi which was not on the menu for our 5 year old who doesn't like spicy food!","Our second time in here. The most delicious Indian food in Bali! Highly recommended! ü§§ portions, flavors, prices. All good! We had garlic naan, plain rice, pappadums,  shrimp curry, chickpeas something and cauliflower dish. The other day we had a biriani vegetarian and mix vegetable something. All is just the top! We love Indian food and tried a lot at many different restaurants. So we can compare.

HOWEVER, don't skip on this place if you're craving Thai food.  My girlfriend has been homesick, and I've tried 3 different Thai restaurants and countless ""thai"" dishes at other restaurants and finally got her what she was craving tonight.

It isn't overly spicy, but they have fish sauce and chili flakes, so you can spice it up, but the base flavors are authentic.","The place is good, i love the wind chimes in front of the resto.

Basically I love the way they decorate the walls. But for me personally, I would appreciate it more if they play Thai songs in the restaurant, instead of playing English songs. It also took me a bit longer time than the usual time to wait for my orders to be served. I also love how they decorate the walls with decorations that represents the kingdom, and definitely the late King Rama 9's pictures are also shown. The ambience is strong enough to make me recall my memories of living 7 years in Thailand (2010-2017).

However, I love how they made the juice I ordered to be very tasty. Though some seasonings do not fully represent local Thai seasonings, but I'm happy enough to recall my memories through the ambience of the decorations. I mean Some Thai spices can't be found in Indonesia, so they seem to change it with other similar spices."

Despite the fact that we live very far away, we sometimes come for lunch or dinner, because the food here is just great, so tasty that it seems to be cooked right at home with love. Like my mom's.
We love the lentil soup, kebabs, bread, sweets. They always treat us to a delicious tea.

We met the owner of the warung.
He is a very friendly and attentive man. His hospitality created a truly homely atmosphere.
I also want to note that the institution is always very clean! All tables are clean, the staff is friendly and attentive.
