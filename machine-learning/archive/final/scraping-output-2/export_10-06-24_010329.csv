I gave the location five stars because it's close to my dentist, like a minute walk, but if you don't have regular transport planned it's not one of those hotels where you walk out into the street and it's touristy straight away so be aware of that.

The hotel is nice and it's quite cheap considered other hotel prices in Bali that can cost up to $100 per night.

The food is okay, the egg needs more seasoning but the side dish is way too salty for my liking, there's a pool in here but it's quite small.

For the bedroom it's okay and the room is clean even though we find few interesting blood spots in the bedsheets but other than that it's okay.",Value for money...

When I walked into the lobby it was dusty, there were no lights, and and old Christmas tree in the hall. The place looked half abandoned. The photos do not match the rooms. I was promised a superior queen room and was given a double bedroom with the view of a cement building. The walls looked as if someone had thrown furniture into it, obviously bumpy/ scratched with a horrible plaster job. There were no towels in the bathroom and the bathroom looked unhygienic.

Carbonara is a bit unexpected way too sweet for my taste most likely use heavy cream of milk.

Gonna come again to try the buffet option.

Overall my experience was enjoyable minus the smoke that comes from the pizza oven. Place is looks a bit old but the toilet is very clean, and the AC was on the warm side. Place is pretty clean but feels old.

Def a good place for Pizza though.","Craving for any Italian üáÆüáπ cuisine in Bali yet it must affordable or rather economically priced.. Yes , Il Pomodoro is well known amongst the local Balinese for their Italian cuisine and I must admit that I love their Family pizza, Spaghetti carbonara, Spaghetti Bolognese, and Ravioli Funghi.. Well, in my opinion, Il Pomodoro serves nice, comforting Italian cuisine reasonably. I dined there twice just to have their family pizza üçï, Spaghetti Carbonara and Ravioli Funghi. For anyone who wishes to savour ItalianüáÆüáπ cuisine in Denpasar area - Jl. Gatot Subroto or rather host a meal gathering with family/friends, you can consider Il Pomodoro because of their wide arrays of menu and friendly service.","I've visited this pasta restaurant twice, and it's quickly becoming one of my favorites! Definitely much better than most pasta places in the city. The food is delectable, especially anything creamy and mushroomy. Their Parmesan is rich and flavorful. Pasta is al dente. The atmosphere is casual and welcoming, complemented by a pleasing color palette inside. While I enjoyed most dishes, I do feel the carbonara could use more meat but the panna e funghi was super delicious. Their desserts are also an absolute treat. Gelato tastes better than most places too. Definitely worth a visit! Highly recommend!

Updated:
After coming here more than 5 times, I think the meat-types pasta dishes could use a little more meat. Sometimes I feel the waitresses could use a little more smile, too. And there have been inconsistencies in some dishes. For example, I ordered carbonara one time and it had a good amount of parmesan but the other time I had to even spend for a small cup of parmesan because I couldn't find any on the dish.

But still, one of the better pasta restos in Bali.","One of the best Italian Restaurant in Denpasar
This resto serves many kind of Italian food like pizza, pasta, gelato, etc","Been here a few times  to have dinner with my family. As always the pizza was great, crispy and a bit thin. Ice cream was really good too. Affordable price and comfortable settings."

I tried to follow up with the agent, but they just redirected me to a different whatsapp number.","This is a terrible company that tried to deceive us. We ordered a car and paid for everything inclusive - the driver, gasoline for 120 km, driver's meals. The driver was 30 minutes late, and then in the middle of the day refused to refuel the car, although we drove 45-50 km, and demanded money for petrol. We contacted this company, and they said that we ran out of petrol because we were in traffic jams and used air conditioning. At the same time, we have a contract where not a word is said about petrol, but only 120 km is indicated. They did not fulfill their obligations, could not explain why they demanded additional money, and this was absolutely contrary to the contract. The solution of this issue was delayed, we did not have time to go anywhere where we planned, and lost a day and money.","Very POOR service. It is categorically not recommended - the driver did not know how to drive and did not use Google maps, he drove me around the same circle many times for 20 minutes until I myself began to speak - right-left, he did not turn on the air conditioner, drove very unsafe, several times we miraculously avoided an accident, there is no customer-oriented approach. If you have a choice, choose another company","We are so happy they way you treat us and showing the good place around Bali, thank you so much.","Happy to stay in BALI, using drivers FTT is Great to choice
Thank you."
