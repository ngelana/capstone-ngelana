We had a villa close to the beach with ocean view. Really comfortable and spacious. Housekeeping was perfect, twice a day at least.
The restaurants are of great quality and service with many options. We also ate on the beach a few steps away from the resort where many seafood restaurants are located. These are cheaper options, quality is generally good or very good. Price for 2 between 200k and 1m depending on what you eat and drink.
The olympic infinity pool is a bliss. The resort offers daily yoga classes for free that are really nice. The gym and spa are also great.
We saw many kids around of all ages. Cannot really comment on kids activities but it also seems to be a great place for families. Overall, I think it is difficult to get it wrong by staying at this beautiful resort!","It is very beautiful, quiet jungle like atmosphere. The rooms are beautiful, clean. It was always so nice just to sit out on the balcony and wash different. Tropical birds flying around. The four season resort is  back off the road. Secluded the only thing that can get down the path is a mopad or walking. Restaurants, little shops, spas within walking distance. Very nice. People are very friendly","We spent 7 days at Four Seasons Residence Villa. The place is huge, pool is so nice and our butler BANA makes the difference with espetacular service. Hotel facilities are amazing and staffs very kind, good quality of food. Kids club have many activities to keep kids from getting bored. But If you want enjoy more the beach is not the best place. Jimbaran beach is not the beautiful one and location is not the best.","Nestled amidst the lush tropical paradise of Bali, the Four Seasons Resorts offer an unparalleled luxury experience that redefines the essence of rejuvenation and indulgence. With two exceptional locations, each one a jewel in its own right, these resorts beckon travelers to embark on a journey of unrivaled opulence and impeccable service.

The Four Seasons Resort Bali at Jimbaran Bay:
Perched atop the cliffs overlooking the majestic Jimbaran Bay, this sanctuary of tranquility envelops guests in a world of understated elegance. From the moment you step into the expansive open-air lobby, adorned with intricate Balinese artistry, you are greeted by a team of dedicated professionals who anticipate your every need with warmth and attention to detail.

The accommodations are a harmonious blend of contemporary elegance and traditional Balinese elements, with each villa boasting a private plunge pool and lush tropical gardens. The resort's culinary offerings are a gastronomic delight, featuring an array of exquisite dining venues, including the renowned Sundara Beach Club, where you can savor exceptional cuisine while basking in the breathtaking sunset vistas.

The Four Seasons Resort Bali at Sayan:
Nestled amidst the verdant rainforest of the Sayan Valley, this resort is a true architectural marvel that seamlessly blends into its natural surroundings. The iconic infinity pool, suspended above the lush greenery, is a sight to behold, offering a serene escape from the world. The villas are masterfully designed, featuring contemporary Balinese decor and private plunge pools with mesmerizing views of the valley.

The resort's commitment to sustainability is evident in its eco-friendly practices, including the use of locally sourced materials and a dedication to preserving the natural environment. The culinary experience here is equally remarkable, with a focus on organic, locally sourced ingredients that celebrate the vibrant flavors of Bali.

Both resorts boast world-class spas that embody the essence of Balinese healing traditions. The skilled therapists at these sanctuaries of relaxation offer a curated selection of treatments, utilizing ancient techniques and natural ingredients to rejuvenate the body, mind, and soul. From the soothing sounds of the chakra ceremony to the indulgent body rituals, each experience is a journey into pure bliss.

What truly sets the Four Seasons Resorts apart is the unwavering commitment of their team to providing personalized, intuitive service that exceeds every expectation. From the friendly smiles that greet you at every turn to the attentive staff who anticipate your needs before you even realize them, the Four Seasons team embodies the spirit of genuine hospitality.

Whether you seek a romantic escape, a family adventure, or a rejuvenating retreat, the Four Seasons Resorts in Bali offer an unparalleled experience that will leave you enchanted and longing to return. Prepare to be captivated by the exceptional service, luxurious amenities, and breathtaking natural beauty that these resorts have to offer ‚Äì a true embodiment of paradise on Earth.","Yes, of course, this is the service and care for guests from the Four Seasons team, but everything is already quite outdated and not fresh. We were upset by lunch at one of the hotel restaurants; the menu was limited and they even managed to spoil the burger with a dry and unsalted cutlet. The cost of living does not justify its quality at all. For half the money you can stay in much better options."

The view is breathtaking and majestic, if you have a clear sky during the visit, the ocean looks majestic. The food is a bit pricey compared to a similar resort but the service makes it worth it","I stayed at the Raffles Hotel in Bali for two nights and it was amazing. The hotel has great facilities and views, even better than the luxury I‚Äôve seen at other top hotels. At first, I felt something was missing in the service - it wasn‚Äôt as warm as I expected, especially since it was my first day and I didn‚Äôt meet any of the hotel‚Äôs managers, which was a first for me at a five-star hotel.

But things got better on the second day. The staff really paid attention to what my family liked, especially at breakfast. They remembered our food preferences, which made us feel really cared for. The hotel‚Äôs restaurant, Loloan, and the SPA were both excellent and worth trying.

Overall, after a bit of a slow start, the service got much better, and I ended up really enjoying my stay at Raffles Hotel. The personal touches made a big difference.","We had a great time staying at Raffles for 5 nights . The staff are very friendly and very helpful .
Our butler Gaby was very helpful and the other butlers in her absence .
A big thank you to Rina and her team at Rumari Resturant , we were so spoilt at breakfast with local fruits , Rina went out of her way to source my favorite local fruits and packed extra for my ride on checkout day . We also tried local cuisine that she managed to organize as we are vegetarian so were limited to the menu .
Big thank you also to Loloan  Resturant , the staff there were great .
The chef went out of his way and made a beautiful curry that was not part of the menu , despite short notice .
The villa was very cleaned very well , was neat and tidy morning and evening , a big thank you to the service team .
Overall - a great stay and left with our pot filled with so much love üôèüôèüôèüëåüëåüëå","Beautiful Property and excellent restaurant but several certain items need work. The villas at this luxury hotel are stunning, with Japanese influences and gorgeous bay views. Outdoor lighting though was lacking.

The restaurants are a highlight, serving top-quality food. The pool area is also very pleasant. The BBQ in villas servers endless food :)!

Unfortunately, the hotel's service accommodating its guests through internet or noise disruptions is simply poor. The gym is inadequate, the WiFi connection has dead spot almost everywhere or it‚Äôs unusable, and there is construction work happening up until 9pm causing noise to the villas.  At the beach you can‚Äôt swim in the sea.

Overall, this hotel has the potential to be fantastic once they iron out the service, noise, and internet issues. If you value beautiful surroundings and great food over everything else, it might work for you. If you need a secluded quiet place currently it might night be the right place. (April 2024) Call to ask.

The pricing over some activities is inconsistent causing some frustration but generally I found that  mostly it didn‚Äôt reflect any quality for the asking price.

The secret cave dining experience is really unique and recommended. Overall the F&B and its service provided was consistently excellent.","Everything was amazing! I just did the wellness retreat hosted by Kim Strother at Raffles and this was the best experience ever. Kim prepared a wonderful program in coordination with the hotel who put in place beautiful settings for our activities and ceremonies. The service was the best we have ever had in a hotel, the amenities are great, the place just magical! I highly recommend a stay at Raffles Bali if you are looking for a rejuvenating, private and personalized moment in the island of Bali! I will come back and already plan to be there for Kim‚Äôs next retreat at Raffles!"

The bread they use is so good. Also have kids corner for your kids to have some fun,"Mixed feelings at ASAI Cafe. The place is not comfy, not cozy. It‚Äôs a strange atmosphere in there. ASIA does not know what it wants to be. Upscale resto and coffee shop or high end resto. It is as far from Bali feeling as it could be. Maybe I made the mistake of having a burger but an iced tea. But a burger and iced tea at 190k is way too much and it was not even that good. I dislike leaving negative reviews but I am being honest and I say it‚Äôs not worth the ride for the atmosphere and the food. There a dozens of better places with a cool vibe in the area.

- plenty of parking
- view from restaurant is great
- food was pretty good
- balcony overlooking the pool and a few trees was quite nice
- somewhat close to various tourist places in Uluwatu

Cons, all related to Room 23:
- the AC was undersized for the room, so it was  warm the entire time. Since the doors don't seal very well, the AC struggled.
- tons of bugs because the doors don't seal. Thankfully, this room also had a family of geckos living there too, so hopefully they can help with the bug problem?
- the shower struggled with getting warm
- toilet paper was mostly gone, no additional roll in the room
- location is far from convenience stores, you need a vehicle to get anywhere
- construction nearby meant early morning noise
- could not stay connected to the wifi

it's a hidden gem and by far our favorite place in Bali.
We loved the glass walls in our top floor room with beach and Ocean view, but also the huge bathroom in the pool view room.

the rooftop terrace it's unbelievable, it has one of the best view points of the area, if not the best.
people are great, bed is super comfortable.
all for great value for money, tens of times less money than the resorts nearby.
Everything is great about this location, make sure you don't miss availability here.
highly recommended it!","It's an beautiful small hotel. We had a cosy room with access to the pool. The roof top terrace is outstanding. Everybody is very polite and helpful. The reasons for ""just"" four stars are that the food is good but you can eat much better in Bali, the area around the hotel is not the best and some of the facilities (shower/hairdryer... ) are not in the best condition.

The appetisers, the tuna dish, the fries and the dessert (the deconstruct) were really delicious.

After our wedding with the help of the very helpful staff at Opia I instructed them to do their very best as this was not your ordinary marriage celebration.

This was a surprise dinner. After the wedding I told my wife we were going to a special place we could buy better quality food and I was going to cook for her and our guests. She sort of bought it but thought this is really far out of the way and started to yell at our driver in Bahasa ""where do you think you're going you're going the wrong way!!!"" Driver says "" patience please.....smiling"" so we finally arrived but she says where's the store...I'm staying here I don't want people looking at me in the supermarket.....I started laughing then said sternly ""you're my wife I'm telling you now to get out of the car we are going in"" she looked like a scolded child and said Ok...so we entered the gate and was met by our lovely event manager. She said nothing as I guided her to the gate which allowed us in to a unimaginable candle lit table with a white rose floral arrangement surrounding our two plates, champagne glasses, silverware  and menus. It was stunning. The table was at the end of a long walkway which was surrounded by water and Greece like architecture with very romantic lighting. It was like a fairy tale. My wife was so overwhelmed she didn't think we were in the right room and said OMG I'm getting out of here and she started running out. I started laughing and said "" Honey this is all for you, she said no you're wrong it's not for me....she was stunned for a few moments until it sunk in. Tears ensued and very big smiles appeared....we pulled it off she had no idea..
I never saw her so happy and excited. Opia did an incredible job and are now a part of our wonderful family tradition. God bless my friends and thank you so much. You will see now the pictures that were taken by their incredible photographer. Just amazing.","Had the most wonderful dinner here tonight! They welcome you with a complementary welcome drink and then follow up with a complementary after drink.

The food was great, the atmosphere was even better but the highlight was the waitress who served us. My son who is 2 years old is very restless and the waitress (forgot to ask her for her name!) was so kind to entertain him and keep him happy.

Lizards and ants everywhere. I get it, we are in the tropics but the swarms are everywhere , including the rooms.

The other room smelled and the linen that covers the beds was full of stains.

The villa looked dated and not maintained. Horrible experience and we checked out after 5 minutes.

The good part is that the staff was nice enough to give us a partial refund.","There are wonderful things about this stay, and some things to know as well. For the right people, this place is amazing. For some, it might not be so.

I booked and stayed here through Airbnb - there are a few different villa owners as far as I understand. On Aibnb it is called ""PRIVATE VILLA COMPLEX"". We stayed at F5 Gangsa Villa.

Important to note: The Gangsa Villa is right next to a semi busy road. The bedrooms sit right along the wall next to the road, and there isn't much soundproofing. Expect to hear the cars and motorbikes on the road throughout the day and a little less at night during your stay. I slept with earplugs and slept great. Not a deal breaker, but always good to know what you are signing up for. I wouldn't call it a quiet and tranquil spot, but it is a fabulous villa.

The Gangsa villa at Pat-Mase Villas is very big and spacious. The master villa is completely separate from the other 2 bedrooms, which is a lower and upper floor. The master has a giant desk that was really great for working. It even has its own separate wifi router as well with great wifi speeds. The bed is very comfortable for Bali in my experience, and comes with a giant mosquito net.

For a couple, or up to 3 couples, this villa is awesome. Or for a family with older kids. I would say this would not be ideal for a family with young kids due to the master being so far away from the other 2 bedrooms. Located on the other side of the property with the pool in between.

All of the bedrooms have nice bathrooms attached. The master has a huge walk in closet area, and a beautiful bathtub area in addition to 2 sinks, a big shower, and toilet. The bathroom and closet do not have air con and the windows are not very easy to open so there isn't much air flow.

The outdoor living space is awesome. Lots of tables and chair space, a fairly comfortable seating area with a giant smart tv! That was really great. Since you can hear the road and the tv is outdoor, it was a little hard to navigate the sound levels - to be loud enough to hear, but not too loud to bother the neighbors.

The kitchen is quite decent with a large gas stove, big fridge, and the essentials. Dewi helped stock it up for me with a rice-cooker, water-heater, pots and pans, knives, and a cutting board, serving bowls, and all the rest. There is no fan or aircon in the kitchen space, but it opens up to the living area outside. As I would cook, I would get quite sweaty due to it not having any airflow haha! But no biggie, this is Bali! Sweaty comes with the territory.

The pool is very large, and is not deep, single depth across. Great for kids! Great for a quick cool-off or to lounge, but there are no chairs to sit by the pool. There is another pool down the steps that is for everyone, right next to the villa as well, with sun chairs. So pools are plenty here! The staff came to clean the pool daily and kept it clean for a daily morning swim.

Location wise, you are a short scooter ride away from Jimbaran beach, tons of local shops and fancy hotels like Raffles and Four Seasons. You will find an awesome seafood spot on the beach called Lia Cafe. Definitely not one to miss for sunset. We had great massages at The Calma Spa - recommended by Dewi. I found a nice western bakery with good coffee, sweets, and gelato right down the road at the Samasta as well. You can find anything you need in this area. Close to the movie theater, malls, and more. Then, you are only a 25-30 min scooter or taxi ride away from all of Uluwatu's best beaches, surfing spots, cafes, and spas down south.

If you are hoping to stay within walking distance or a short ride, I would probably recommend to go further south as it is quite a ride out. A car, scooter, or taxi is really a must for this location.

Fabulous villa, comfortable beds, and the fast internet. The cleaning was sometimes lacking due to the need of more communication about what to clean and when.","Nice place, kinda scary though. Security is not that great giving an uneasy vibe to the place. villas are hard to lock and the windows are bordered up shut, rooms have very bad lighting.

Furniture was not the best nor were the amenities. In saying that - the pools were lovely, staff really tried hard to provide the best service for guests.

Villas location was also not ideal. Depends on what you want from your holidays though, good for larger groups,","I could write a long story about this place but will keep it as brief as possible. In short not a very good place. First the good news - the staff are very friendly and nice and the villas are roomy. After that it's all downhill. We had to move villa twice due to problems (no hot water, aircon issues, creatures making loud noises at night in the rooms). We were advised that the villas are each privately owned and the levels of maintenance (Lack thereof) indicate this. The state of disrepair is not good. Leaking toilets, shower roses that need replacing, holes in floors, gaps in doors when they are closed (if you can close them) etc...

The Wifi for the whole complex kept breaking down and they had to call technicians. There is no Wifi ever in your villa and this is a big mistake. There is only limited wifi outside the villa in an outdoor lounge area, but this works on and off and at best is really slow....

Breakfast is a joke. Worst I have seen for many a year. The food is terrible and cold. The hi-light was an egg or toast. The setting is even worse. It is outdoors with no fans and on the edge of a very busy road. So the noise is overwhelming and too hot to enjoy a meal. What's more is that the capacity of the eating area would not be 10% of the complex capacity so was over loaded at times - we were told on the first morning at 9am to come back another time - they close at 10am!!! They also set up tables into reception for people to eat.

Sad, because the concept of private villas is a good one, but this has serious design faults and needs some money spent to bring it up to standard. I do not understand how this place could have been recommended to us from our travel agent. Sub-par.  The location is also not near anything so you need to take taxis a bit.","Very disappointed with this location. We previously stayed at Alaya Resort and although smaller living quarters, the service was absolutely amazing compared to this. We were right near the lobby, asked for ice about 6 times and yet no one was able to come by. Towels were the same situation. We asked if they could make a reservation at a restaurant for us as we don‚Äôt speak the native language and rather than calling, they said it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem and just go. I don‚Äôt know whether it was true or because they were lazy, but because of our experience so far we are assuming the later. I don‚Äôt recommend this location to anyone. We haven‚Äôt even spent a night here and we are already looking for other, more reputable places to stay starting ASAP."

The tiny pool on the 3rd floor is dirty and no water, the main pool a lil bit dirty too. The check in was one hour late. The location a bit far from any mini market. You should bring some drinks and food before get to the villa.

But please don't come for food here.
We ordered pizza, seafood pasta and surf&turf. All were terrible: pizza made from a standard frozen one, seafood was the cheapest seafood cocktail (unrecognizable chunks and pieces) and the tuna was small and dry. Only the shrimps and potato free were fine.
The staff weren't rude, but didn't care much.
The space was well decorated, but the music was irrelevant.","It's a nice small rooftop restaurant, with very limitedseatingcapacity. You have to take the elevator to a higher floor - I think it was floor 3.

The waitress was friendly when she took the order. The only challenge we had in this place, they had no stock of fish, shrimps or seafood.

Every time we asked for a dish, they didn't have it. So we ended up ordering a Hawaian pizza üçç which was not great.

The base of the pizza was a frozen bread. They heated the base, added the ingredients on top, and served it as a pizza.

The view was great. That's unarguably the best part of the restaurant.","Pros:
- Great rooftop views.
- All the food we tried was delicious.
- Price is reasonable considering the quality of the food & views.
- The staff are friendly.
- Tenderloin steak was tender and cooked to requested level. I assume they actually used good quality meat.
- Western and Indonesian options.

Cons:
- No AC, but this is to be expected for an open air rooftop cafe.
- Road to get there is a little rough for the last bit, but not impassable.
- Food took a while compared to other places we have been to, but was worth the wait!

Price range given includes a main and a drink.","A gem in Jimbaran. Clean, modern, great atmosphere. The view over the bay is spectacular. The food is tasty. The prices are sooooo affordable. We had a Caesar salad and a sirloin steak with pineapple juice and mineral water for less than 10 usd.",This is a memorable place for me as this is where I ask my best friend to be my girlfriend!

Service was impeccable and the cocktails were some of the best made I have ever had! Highly recommend if you can.","I went here for Sunday Brunch and dinner. The brunch was quite best deal to me, got a champagne pairings as well. I wish the cheese selection was not local ;p

However everything was so good, food, service, and ambiance were super nice to me.","We had the ""Secret Cave"" dinner at Rumari as guests at the Raffles retreat. Nothing I can possibly say in a few words can do justice to the experience. Everything was just perfect. From the incredibly ""detailed"" delicious food which is truly deserving of a Michelin star, the almost transcendental environment within a natural cave surrounded by the beautiful flora of Bali, to the impeccably attentive yet subtle and very friendly service. A very memorable experience indeed which I cannot recommend enough. Just go!","My last visit was on January 2023, and I got different treatment compare to foreigner.

As we stepped into the exquisite ambiance of Taman Wantilan at the Four Seasons Resort Bali in Jimbaran Bay, we were instantly captivated by the blend of elegance and relaxation that the restaurant exuded. Celebrating the craftsmanship of the culinary team, Taman Wantilan proved to be an extraordinary dining experience that left an indelible mark on our hearts and taste buds.

The sizzle and aroma of the fresh seafood being expertly grilled before our eyes added an element of theater to the meal. The succulent flavors of the perfectly cooked seafood left us craving for more, making it a true delight for seafood enthusiasts.

The Laksa and Noodle station, reminiscent of street food stalls, transported us to the bustling streets of Asia. The made-to-order dishes allowed us to customize our meals to our preferences. The aromatic broth of the Laksa was a revelation, rich with layers of flavor that perfectly balanced spice and comfort.

The culinary journey continued with the Lamb Rack, a masterpiece of culinary expertise. Cooked to perfection, the tender meat practically melted in our mouths, accompanied by exquisite sauces that elevated each bite to a symphony of flavors.

The Salad Shaker bar was a refreshing twist, empowering us to create personalized salads by selecting from an array of fresh ingredients. This unique approach to salad preparation made the experience not only delectable but also fun and engaging.

No meal is complete without dessert, and Taman Wantilan exceeded expectations with its Gelato and Crepe station. The variety of gelato flavors and the option to customize our crepes with an assortment of toppings left us feeling like kids in a candy store.

For those with a penchant for Japanese delicacies, the sashimi station showcased the finest cuts of fish, expertly sliced and presented. Each piece melted in our mouths, showcasing the highest quality and freshness.

Our dining experience at Taman Wantilan was made even more special by the presence of our lovely family. The restaurant's warm and welcoming atmosphere encouraged us to indulge in good conversations, creating lasting memories that we will cherish.
