Karangasem, Kabupaten Karangasem, Bali 80811, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17130696708227993979,OPERATIONAL,+62 822-4735-7476,museum,museum,4.8,181,,"Beautiful experience! Pustaka Lontar are traditional books made out of palm leaves. They try to preserve the 300 year old Lontar and the tradition of making them. Every step of the process is shown and explained in the museum and then you can try to write your own Lontar. You can write your name and hang it to the names of other guests or you take it as a souvenir.
The museum is in a beautiful green area  wirh traditional houses so it does not get to hot there.",Something slightly offbeat and not overrun with tourists. A definite must do if you are touring around east bali.,"This Museum is a must-see for anyone interested in art, history & lontar for sure. Has a vast collection of lontar that is sure to please. The knowledgeable staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, making it a great experience. There are plenty of interactive activities and educational opportunities available to visitors, making it a great place to spend some time. Highly recommended!","Great place if you are interest in Balinese Sanskrit symbols and writings. Learn to write your own name in Balinese and take it away on traditional lontar ""paper"". Small donation","We've got good impression on this museum which is run well by Dukuh Penaban privately. The green and clean environment strongly support the compound site of the museum. The friendly staffs describe and show us what lontar is and its usage. They are able to assist us in writing our names or words in Balinese on Palm-Leaf (lontar). Moreover, we can see some lontar collection and its transcription."
