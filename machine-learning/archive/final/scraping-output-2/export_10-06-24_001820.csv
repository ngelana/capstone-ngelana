We went there looking for some nice coffee and a guide to take us to the waterfall. What was supposed to be a quick stop ended up in a great experience for us. We were able to see the sunset , enjoy amazing food and even sing laraope with the locals that gather there.
We didn't want to leave and were sad when we did. We had such an amazing experience and would love to do it again
Thank you so much Mister and Miss Santa for being such awesome people and making us feel part of your family","Very nice spot. Fantastic view. Coffee is good. Bintang even better. It is a fantastic view of the sea and mountains.

You definitely need to ask him to guide you, as the way is down the cliffs pretty much, on ladders and steps
But the spot after is so rewarding, and the swim so good!

Highly recommend!!",The waterfall was soooo beautiful and eke was really nice and helpful he even helped us buying some fresh vanilla afterwards.,"Good guide, speaks a good English and even made me try durian fruit !
Thanks Eka and your parents for your time !",Good day,
