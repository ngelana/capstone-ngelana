While the specialty Babi Guling is delightful, coming here solely for it might feel like a bit of a waste of time. It‚Äôs best visited after enjoying nearby attractions like Ubud. Definitely a wonderful spot to stop by, so make sure to visit!","Amazing dinner with great view from the second floor, filled with mostly local people.
Crispy special pig and sate are to die for. Same for the desserts.
A bit far away from the centre but worth the drive!
Great service too, we will come back.","I think its one of the best nasi babi guling in bali..located in gianyar..its located next to rice fields so it has a beautiful scenery..the food is also great..lots of pork inside and all is delicious..the special item which is very rare in the other nasi babi guling is pork sausages..they also have gelato,ice cream,cakes and some other foods,the only minus thing about this place is its location..we must go through up and down road in a small alley","5-stars is never enough to describe how sensationally impressed by these amazing dishes!

Babi guling special and pork satay, I would say this is the best pork dish I have ever tasted in my life. Everything is super delicious and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is very chilled and service staff are friendly too.
Although the location might seem a bit inconvenient to visit from the central Ubud, this must-go restaurant would never disappoint you if you are looking for the right place to taste Babi guling.
Highly recommended!!!","Superb place if you are looking for babi guling. Taste was great and also it's not expensive. Only 25K per portion. They also provide children menu as well. Beside that they also sell durian, kolak, and also some fried snacks. You also dine beside padi field. Great place!"

If you visit the waterfall, don't forget to stop by. You better go here and then maybe go by the waterfall. This is worth a lot more! Super warm welcome, the prices are more than fair. Order more portions and don't forget dessert. Must visit!","Cannot agree more with the other review! The place is really hidden but well worth the detour! We came here on our way to Sidemen. Food was excellent, really cheap as well. Having small portions allows you to taste diff√©rents meals which we loved, and the host was adorable! Really recommend!",Amazing location! If you visit the waterfall make sure to check out this lovely restaurant. The staff were so friendly and nice and the food was delish! The portion sizes are small but the cheap price means you can order a couple of dishes which is nice anyways to try multiple things!,"- Location: Surrounded by rice terraces and gardens, offering a natural setting.
- Cooking: Fresh herbs used by Ibu, the chef, for authentic dishes.
- Ambiance: Spacious with a fish pond, reflecting a calm Bali style.
- Value: Great food at affordable prices.
- Quietness: Peaceful and less crowded during the day.
- Hospitality: Ibu is friendly and welcoming.
- Overall: A simple, authentic dining experience in a serene environment.",Delicious food and service! Very chilled place to visit and have a traditional meal. Located in the quiet area surrounded by rice fields.

It‚Äôs one of the most cutest cafe I‚Äôve ever been so far üôèüèºüíï,"Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city, this is little oasis of relaxation.

The cozy interior with its comfortable seating and soft lighting creates the perfect ambiance for a quiet spot to work or a peaceful hideaway to enjoy a conversation with friends.

I had the Kopi Susu Gula Aren, love it üíï
Will come and order it again","Truly a hidden gem. Don‚Äôt get fooled by the lack of reviews, this place is great. Very friendly staff, reasonably priced menu, and really well designed. I only have good things to say, so definitely give it a visit.",We stopped when going around to different waterfalls. The drinks and food were so tasty! Such a relaxing atmosphere. Glad we stopped!

They have nice view and music is also great. Recommended between waterfall hopping,"The place has a great view. If gou compare it with pan egi next door this place is ofc less packed. One thing that u have to know their chicken is super good. If u order the one for 30 k u can see how the meat just falls off the bone.  Overall the food is 9.5

One small thing they have to improve is the speed of their food serving it wasnt long. However, if they can go faster abit would be great.

In general nice place to sit and have lunch.","Was here because the restaurant nearby were too crowded. Actually the taste is decent, and scenery of the field is also outstanding. Not bad. The staff also quiet helpful and ready to help anyone. Although the parking lot are available, but it is still not well maintained. The location also too far from main road, and quiet small for small car.",Thank you! Nasi ayam was delicious. I liked the view. The place is tranquil and clean.,"Apparently this is one of the best place to get babi but the meT was very tough.

Didnt enjoy it as much‚Ä¶"
