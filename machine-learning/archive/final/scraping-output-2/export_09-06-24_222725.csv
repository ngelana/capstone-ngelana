The personal is so nice and they help us with everything we need. Thank you!","We (couple) stayed here for three nights in a villa with ricefield view. It was just perfect!

Staff is very friendly and helpful with everything. Also we felt very safe here; it‚Äôs really quiet and peaceful at Manik Segera. We would love to come back :-)."
