The place is beautiful, wirh a nice garden, the staff is very friendly and the food is delicious.

There is fantastic acoustic band on Saturdays and everyone is welcome to sing (the chef is actually amazing).

Moreover, the warung is a central piece of the Kym Upton Foundation, where child brides and vulnerable teenager girls are thaught the trade of hospitality (cooking and waitressing) before being placed in secure jobs in Bali. So when you go to Hang Out Warung, you're actually participating in the humanitarian effort.",,,,
