We booked the two day car rent+ driver service and Gede was amazing. He was fun, cool and explained about the local culture a lot. We even went to the market and bought some Balinese fruits to try.
On the third day we booked a private boat trip with snorkeling and it was amazing. The snorkeling diver was so good and made me experience snorkeling without any worries
The admin is very quick and good at communicating as well.
Overall 10/10 experience","We had the pleasure of meeting Gede as soon as we arrived at the port. While taking us to our hotel destination we realized how friendly Gede was (and his good knowledge of english), how comfortable his car was thus, we inquired about tours. He showed us the typical packages and told us that we could ""make our own as well"". He became part of our family for the next 3 days.

Gede showed us all around the island, took us to the best spots, provided us local knowledge and never rushed us. Because of Gede we had a PHENOMENAL experience while here on Nusa Penida.

Thank you Gede for an amazing time - one we will never forget!!! Saksuma!","5 star! Very thoughtful guide to take our picture and don‚Äôt talk too much at first bcs he knows we tired from morning boat.
Admin also fast response and informative. Keep up the good work!","the best experience trying a local vendor for my holiday. Usually, first time order sometimes give an average experience, not that good and not that bad. But this travel agent really shows me everything in Nusa Penida with a good way they can. I am enjoying every second in Nusa Penida. Next time, absolutely, I will find you again Bli Agus.",We had a great East coast Nusa Penida trip with a car + driver. It was very easy to setup a reservation and the company was very flexible with where to go and what time to start. Definitely would recommend!

Airconditioned with TV, no fridge in the room.
easy to hire the bike from reception and request pick and drop to the Ferry Point.
Drawback: The cabin is in the woods so you may be find allot of reptiles, lizards or gecko's which may come inside the room from the any splits or spaces in the wooden cabin. Net available on the bed for mosquitoes and to stop any intruding reptiles.","I recently had the privilege of staying at the most enchanting accommodation I've ever encountered. From the moment I set foot in this tranquil oasis, I was absolutely captivated. Every aspect of this stay, from the beautiful apartment to the accommodating staff and scrumptious breakfast, exceeded my wildest expectations!","For the price it‚Äôs OK but not more sadly

Positives:
The view is exceptional. The staff is very responsive and friendly. They offer a food delivery to the hotel available which is convenient and tastes ok. The bedroom is technically cozy, however ...

Negatives:
there was a lot of gecko faeces during our stay and already when we arrived on the first evening. The room and especially the bathroom has not been properly cleaned. Even after requesting another cleaning, it was still dirty and the cottage itself is poorly constructed. Through the roofs large cockroaches (7-8cm) and geckos (20-25cm) entered our room.","Wanna find a quite place to spend your night in Nusa Penida? Hotra Hill Cottage can be put to your choice.

Eventhough the road to reach this area was not good enough, but really worth it once you get there. Nice view in the morning ant afternoon, if there is no clound you can see Mount Agung in Bali - Karangasem directly in from of your room.

The staff was friendly and beautiful nature and birds song would accompany your journey.

Please notice that there was no munch ""warung"" or restaurant available close to this cottage :) (radius 1-2 km from the cottage)","The road was really bad and a challenge everytime with our scooter. But i did make it really funny! :) The area was wonderful and really quiet. All the people living there we welcoming and kind. The hotel itself was perfectly clean and comfortable. Besides all that the best thing were the employes. They were the most helpful and loving people weve met the whole time we were in Nusa Penida (and Bali). They help you out even if its about your personal problems. Even tho the have trouble speaking english. The still give their best to let you have a wonderful stay. They even made a bonfire with us and talked to us with google tranlator. :D And we all enjoyed the night together.
So we really wanna thank you for those beatiful memories.
Youre are good hearted people and we hope we will see you again. And were still really sorry about the thing with the kitten ;) :) Om shanti shanti shanti om"

They drove us to dinner, shared their barbecue with us, arranged snorkelling, took us to the ferry and more. The hostel part and the pool are very new. And the beds have a light & power outlet. :)","Thank you! An ideal combination of price and quality, convenient location near the port if you arrived by ferry from Bali with a car. We came with our parents for two nights - the room costs 240k per night with a choice of breakfast. The beds were clean and very comfortable, we had a great night's sleep between our trips around Penida Island. At 6 am we needed to catch the ferry, as there is limited space for cars and we need to get in line. Here they prepared an amazingly delicious omelette and dragonfruit juice for us to take with us in our travel container. We are all very pleased with the quality of housing and comfort! Thank you.","Great place, quiet, secluded, friendly staff and great service! Just a little bit of a drive from the main road but well worth it! Will be back :)","After more than 2 weeks traveling in Indonesia, this family owned bungalows was our favorite by far.

Their suggested a taxi service from the harbor to their hotel, which was twice less expensive as the harbor price. A scooter rental is also available for very good price and quality (we needed it to drive on the island adventurous road).

Breakfast is really flexible and made with love.

The room was super clean and a great shower with open roof.

I‚Äôm not used to let some review, but this one really deserves it.

Thanks again üôå","This is a very beautiful place to stay in Nusa Penida. Good service, very clean rooms and beautiful views !"
