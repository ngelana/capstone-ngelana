We tried the popcorn chicken, Chicken Corden Bleu, Bakso Gurami, and the Cumi Bakar Oles. This was a nice variety and everything was amazing.
The location was perfect, the service was amazing and the food was exactly what we wanted, delicious!
We will be back again and highly recommend this place if you need food in the area.
Don't forget to check out the hidden garden next door if you like your coffee.","The view is nice, staff was attentive and friednly (I forgot the name, but she was very kind). They have promotion for Durian and I was order es teler durian, however the taste not as espected. My husband ordered sweet sour fried gurame and it was so tasty.","What a sweet little warung. Great view, lovely service and delicious food. Prices are regular, with most dishes between 50-100, appetisers starting from about 25.","Lovely restaurant for a pit stop on your way up to North Bali, such as to the Twin Lakes, Bedugul Temple or Lovina.
Food was good and very reasonably priced. The sambal is amazing.

Had the mie goreng, grilled fish (ikan bakar), grilled chicken and some sides (vegetable: kangkung, and soy products: tauhu and tempeh). Fruit juices were good too. The mango juice was not sweet naturally (they asked of we wanted to add sugar. We said no). Service top notch, all staff very attentive and happy üòÄ üëèüèº
Thank you üôèüèΩ Suksme.","Staff is ok, greeting is ok, place is ok, the view is good
But what make me dissapointed was, the food,
I'm about to order fish and chip and ask the size of the fish to the staff and she said it was large, but when it come to my table, its only 2 small piece of it, and it taste Fishy, like its not fully cooked

tempe mendoan : good

Lime tea : i dont know why, but it feels like the water is too much, with a little lime and tea, and what shocks me more, i can taste ginger in it

And Another 2 F&B :
Honey dew is good
chicken parmigiana is ok

please review again the size/portion in your menu, and the utensil you used in the kitchen

Cause the restaurant is a good place to enjoy the food with a good view, but sadly what comes to my table made me not enjoy my lunch"

The portion just right with great balance of spicy flavours combined with warm chicken soup. Amazing,"The meal was tasty. It's chicken base (muslim friendly) and worth for a Balinese cushion. You can choose to eat indoor or outdoor (with a nice view around).
The price was affordable for all. Range from IDR 20k. Small parking lot. If you are going to Singaraja or back to Denpasar (from Singaraja) have a visit here, i bet you'd like it.","Lunch with a view! A very comfort food nasi ayam betutu, I really like the broth soup. Order two portion if you have big appetite. The view outdoor near bale-bale is amazing, you can see the mountain. Clean toilet, friendly staff and fast service.","I can say this is still a hidden gem. When travelling to Bali, local food and scenery are one of the things that tourists are looking for. And this is definitely one of the places that offer good local food with good scenery.

But the place is quite far from the Airport, so there are not a lot of people coming here. If you just happen to visit bedugul, Beratan lake, or Bali Handara, you can travel a bit to reach this place","Balinese chicken rice, completed with fried shrimp and one good hot chicken soup to warm your chilling air, magnificent green hills and mountain backdrop.
Price! Affordable budget one. You shouldn‚Äôt miss this one."
