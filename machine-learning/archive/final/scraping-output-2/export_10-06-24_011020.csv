It's calm no noise and the rooms are clean and cozy. It also has a beautiful view you can enjoy,"Lovely little place to stay, good location.
However, the chicken farm next door is very noisy from 5.30 AM.
The light switches are a bit weird as the ceiling light comes on when turning on the light in the bathroom. All lights, even the ones switched off, started flickering during heavy rains. It's a bit unnerving.
The staff are very friendly and helpful and a small breakfast is served on your balcony. The garden is lovely and well maintained.","Andi from Germany here,
If you have a scooter and want something really peaceful away from the crowds this can be your little place of heaven. We booked the deluxe double room (no 3.) and it was near the pool.
There is an AC but no fridge, a small but tasty breakfast with coffee or tea, a great swimming pool which we mostly had to ourselfs.
The beds are really new and comfy, the room service does a good job, nice showers and toilet.
For the low price it was a really great find ! :-)
Wifi is OK (like everywhere on the island - no 4k video standard but ok to book places etc.)

There are also 2 little cats which visit you sometimes - you can buy some catfood in the city next to the petrol station if you like.

We had an absolutely awesome 8 days and already missing the place.
Enjoy ‚úåÔ∏è

Also the bad experience we had with owner.
We rented the bike here and none of them is in good condition. And at night while returning middle of jungle it got punctured. Owner was not at all reachable over call and we had to suffer alone in night.The next day same puncture again happened with their bikes and owner dint even send help or helped us in convincing local people to help. Even the locals are rude in this area and wont help. But as a owner she refused to help the guest during difficult situation. We had very bad experience in Nusa penida because of thier not maintained bike and bad attitude. We will never recommend this place to anyone.","Our stay at this guest house was an absolute delight. We opted to rent the whole house with three bedrooms, and it provided us with a comfortable and convenient space to call home during our vacation.

The house, while slightly older and noisier compared to the smaller units, still offered all the essentials we needed for a pleasant stay. The bedrooms were cozy and provided a restful night's sleep. The common areas were well-equipped, allowing us to prepare meals and spend quality time together as a group.

One of the standout features of the guest house was the inviting pool. It provided a refreshing oasis where we could relax and beat the tropical heat. The pool area was well-maintained, and we appreciated having this additional amenity to enjoy during our stay.

While our particular house had some age-related issues, we learned that the smaller units were newer and boasted improved windows and doors, which effectively addressed noise concerns. If tranquility and a quieter environment are important to you, we recommend considering the smaller units for a more optimal experience.

The area surrounding the guest house was also noteworthy. We found the location to be convenient and to our liking, with easy access to local attractions, shops, and restaurants. Whether we wanted to explore the local culture or simply indulge in the nearby amenities, everything was within reach.

In terms of pricing, we found the guest house to offer excellent value for the amenities and space provided. Considering the affordability and the availability of essential features, we were more than satisfied with the overall value of our rental.","We rented a room which is a small house. Everything was perfect. The staff is very friendly and helpful. You can rent scooter at that place so you don't need to find elsewhere. They also had an own restaurant where you can eat. The only thing what I want to mention is the breakfast: the portions are a little bit small, but I give 5 stars because everything else was good!","My sister and I rented a double room which was very comfortable. We were welcomed by the beautiful daughter who assists with check in and cooking. The pool was perfect, and they were very accommodating. Great value for price. Would definitely go back again.","10/10 would definitely recommend everyone! The Host was the kindest Person, I've met so far on my trip. She is so caring and helpful and helped us with all our questions and crisis's, even after we checked out!
The rooms were clean and welcoming, the breakfast was nice, the pool beautiful.
You can also book a snorkeling trip which I would definitely recommend!"

The room is spacious and clean, very comfy beds, they ask what you want for breakfast the night before and bring it to you on your little terrace. The pool is lovely, you can also get a massage for 100K by the pool, very nice. Cutest little dog called Amel made out stay even better!","Staying at RR Cottage was a hit, an excellent choice for our needs. To be honest, the hotel and the host exceeded our expectations. The hotel is intimate (only 4 cottages), with a beautiful garden and a swimming pool and loungers for relaxation. The owner takes care of every detail: there are extra towels for the pool, a good scooter can be rented on site, she helps arrange a ferry to or from the island and arranges a cab to get to the hotel, which is about a 20-minute drive from the port. The hotel is some distance from the town which means you have to drive to the store. Literally 50 meters from the hotel is a nice warung and there are several within a few minutes by scooter, with really delicious local food. What's more, nearby you can also find a small spa where, for little money, you can relax with a pleasant Balinese massage after a day of sightseeing.
The only thing that may disturb the rest of sensitive people is the fact that the doors open by moving the door leaves to the sides, which means that they cannot be closed completely tight from the surroundings. For this reason, small insects and geckos may enter the room. There's probably nothing we can do about it and it wasn't bothersome for us in any way, I'm only mentioning it so that no one will be disappointed.","Nice place to stay. The rooms are nice, clean with AC. Only the bathroom was little bit stinky. The breakfast is nice and delicious. The staff were friendly and helpful all the time. We would recommend this place.","We had a great stay at RR Cottage. The staff was really nice and provided awesome breakfast on our porch every day. The simple room was clean. There was no mosquito net, but we didn't have any problems with mosquitos so that didn't bother us. The pool area is nice too. We also booked a snorkeling trip through them and they organized a laundry service and taxi for us to get back to the harbour. The location is convenient too, 15 min from the harbour and right across the street is a really good Warung. We also rented a scooter through them for a good price. Would definitely come back! As a plus: two very cute dogs live there.","It's very nice unexpencive simple accommodation. People here are working  hard to provide good service and try their best. It's not fancy, but we were satisfied. Good WIFI. Clean small pool. Recommended"

In such a small village, after a very hectic trip, the food here felt like heaven in mouth. Highly recommending visiting here","Well,  i ordered one food and it was chicken curry, it served with large portion, it was balinese curry, i dont really like the taste maybe not suit with my mouth, maybe its not the recommended food at there,  the price same at the other place, the place was nice and the lemon tea also refreshing","Food is delicius and good service with alot off smile,i was eat there and they do good service for us,thank mangku su team and the voyage resto for best service you give üëç","Good.

The service was good but the food comes out sporadically because of the limited kitchen capabilities unfortunately.
We ordered the fried calamari and spring rolls as appetizers which were quite good actuary.
We also ordered the grilled fish which was fresh but slighlty charred served with a side of rice and sambal for 70,000 rup. As it happens a lot over here they never tell you what they're out of until you want to order; they just didn't bring out the spring rolls the table next to us ordered instead of telling them  (maybe hoping they'd forget or saving face ? )
They need to seriously get Wi-Fi there with all the tourists coming in!",Nice place and friendly staff! They have a cat which is very cute! Good food! Worth the  money! Ambience and music (Indonesian though) was also nice!,"Good ambiance, nice interior, music,and friendly staff. Also open Till late night. But the food serving time is quite long, you'll finish your drinks before your food arrive, haha","Food was good but I‚Äôve had a better chicken Satay at Makan Restu, the dragon fruit juice was quite good. Will come back to try the pancakes.","Great food. Very recommend.
We stopped by on our way from Kilingkling beach (T-Rex) to Crystal beach. Ordered Indonesian fried fish, chicken teriyaki and some juices. Everything delicious and well presented. Place looks clean, good shade, and staff very kind.
Come here, you won't regret it."
