Would definitely come back to stay and have their banana pancakes breakfast everyday!","Booked it on our last day in Uluwatu, such a lovely boutique hotel with great service, friendly smiling staffs, so helpful with our request.
Some highlights of my stay here:
🌱 Food: they only have a few options for breakfast, but great taste, we had french toast and fried rice, all lovely and tasty.
🌱 Room: well designed and decorated, even had a mini kitchen and a sink in our room, very thoughtful. Though the bathroom is pretty basic but thats alright.
🌱 Services: one of the best places in Bali that offers such nice experiences during my trip.
🌱 Pool: small but so clean and just look at the picture 💓

Totally recommended.","We spent 3D2N stay here. The staff were amazingly friendly and helpful. Our room was upgraded. So that's a plus! Spacious size for only 2 people. Pool was decent. Breakfast was served ala carte style not buffet but quite good portion. The stairs leads to the 3rd room isn't recommended though for someone with some physical disabilities. Over all, we were happy with this place.","Greeted by very hospitable staff who were helpful throughout my stay there.

Nice and clean place with an affordable price.

We were impress that it was really nice to stay here. We were a little bit skeptical about how this was going to go, but all good things honesty.
The stuff is really attentive and nice.
The pool + garden are amazing and the rooms are simple but perfect for the price that you pay here.

It’s a little bit away from Uluwatu, so I recommend you coming here with your own transportation, so you can move freely.","We loved this place. 10/10

This is a great place to come on a budget, fantastic pool and chilling area, a little communal kitchen and a great atmosphere.

The rooms are cozy and most have outside showers, but they had everything you need, very clean and A/C.

It's a great location too, nice and quiet at night but only 15 mins away to get to all the beaches and restaurants. There are also 3 restaurants basically next door to Rebels Point that all serve good food.

Richard, the host, is super friendly, nothing was too much trouble. He was very accommodating and is full of useful info. He looked after us very well. He also rents scooters at a very good price..

There are a couple of cute dogs on the property (Rebel & Limpy) both were very friendly!

The place was relatively busy, with many backpackers and travellers of all age groups, everyone seemed pretty chilled and there was a nice atmosphere overall.

When we come back to Bali, we'll definitely be back 😊","Affordable, fully equipped shared kitchen, refreshing pool, quiet place and great service. Big recommend."

It's hardly a scam (as they give deluxe size for deluxe size), but many of the rooms they offer don't actually have the decorations as promoted in apps (Agoda, traveloka). For the same cost, you might as well find another hotel closer to the beach with equal quality with breakfast.

Don't let yourself astray with the promotional photos. The deluxe room we received is bland with no design, although it is indeed spacious. The bed cover is heavily damaged by cigarette. The good thing is they do have a fridge and a very cold air conditioner against the heat of Jimbaran.

A lot of parking spot for car and motorbikes.

A lot of pools (we saw two) and they're actually quite clean. But we didn't have the time for a simple dip.","My experience was mixed. Dont get deceived by the pics, Go by the price. They provide the service and rooms according to their price which is damn cheap.

My bed had ants and when requested to change the bed sheets, they immediately attended to it which was good.

The property is infested with reptiles like lizard, frogs, chamoleons etc which will be a problem for those with reptile allergy like me.

Overral I would give it a 3.5/5. They have a restaurant inside and provide decent food for a reasonable price.","I'm someone with a reasonable thinking, when I pay how much I should get what
So I think what I paid and what I got is equal, kinda super worth actually, will be back here when need accomodation in Jimbaran area in the future 😊👌",Peaceful place and kind owners ! 3 swimming pools and everything to feel good for holidays !,"A tidy guest house for those on a budget. The room I had was quite large and included a fridge, TV and couch.

Check in was super quick and the staff were helpful.

I worked from the hotel Cafe area a few days in a row and it was a decent place to set up and take some calls.

There are some tasty warungs and cheap laundry places within walking distance of the premise.

I like that there are 3 pools here and there is greenery in the garden.

The walls of my room were a little thin and I could hear my neighbor talking loudly a few nights in a row that woke me up, So if you require a very quiet room, keep that in mind when booking here. The shower in the bathroom was also an odd configuration in where they put the faucet (see pics) and the bath itself was tired looking and had some dark stains. If they replaced it, it would give the room a bit of a lift.

The Jimboran area is ok. I would probably book something Uluwatu next time to be closer to the action.

But I did enjoy my stay here and it met my expectations for what I paid (40$ usd per night)"

Devil is in the detail though…. how can it be so hard to get served when there are six or seven staff but you are the only customers? Last time even waving with both arms couldn’t attract their attention. Have to get up to approach them.

Ladies toilet - can’t seem to lock from inside. Gents, the floor was filthy last time.

Two of our three visits the hand-soap has been empty. Are staff using these toilets than not washing their hands?

You will find broken sink table at the bathroom, bathroom full of cockroach, broken fridge that we asked to repair but they never did (physically it is broken which we don't care, but it is not functioned well also), broken sofa (this one we complained before checked in and they replaced), and when we first checked in, they only had 2 rooms out of 5 that we can use (other 3 still need repair which take time and much noise).

Cows live behind the property meaning the heat makes the place smell of cow pats.","Wonderfully secluded and charming cottages nested in the tree line pastures, accessible to all of the attractions south of Bali airport.",Nice and quiet place and far from shops. Stay is super pleasant and Villa is good too,Top oasis,

Staff are amazing and friendly and very welcoming the two nights we went where one of the best nights we have had in a long time. Thankyou so much to The Bucket Jimbaran for making our stay here feel like home.",A great little rustic sports bar nestled in the Jimbaran backstreets...friendly service and good food (esp the local stuff). There are plenty of fans humming away and it is a pleasantly relaxed place to watch the footy...recommended,"A- MUST try sausage rolls in the town! fish and chips in this place is my champion.

I can't recommend this place enough, you won't regret your stay 🙏",We enjoyed our stay at Puri Karibu Studio Houses! The communication with the hosts were amazing - very quick responses and always happy to solve problems! They helped us to rent scooters and extending the stay was also no problem. Can recommend!,"I absolutely loved my stay at Puri Saribu studio house. It’s by far one of my favourite Airbnb’s in Bali.

The unit was clean, the kitchen had all the utensils I needed to prepare yummy food. Yuri and his family were amazing hosts, they were really responsive of ever I had any questions or needed help. I highly recommend staying here. The wifi works incredibly well for zoom calls. I will be back next time I’m in Bali.","Nice and clean studio. Has everything what you need for one or two persons. Fast internet, aircon which really cools down if you want to. Most beaches of bukit are within a 10 to 30min drive away. So right in the center of bukit peninsula. The communication with the host was well organised and got fast response all the time. Will stay there again on my next visit","This was by far the best place to stay in Bali! The apartment was super clean, with everything one needs to cook. There was a great cleaning service too. The garden is beautiful and looked after very well - watered and cleaned everyday. Yudi and his family are so helpful and very kind - they are so accommodating and always ready to assist. They even allowed me to take part in a traditional Balinese ceremony with their family, which was such a great experience. Water is delivered when needed at a great price! I would 100% recommend this place. Thank you Yudi and family for the wonderful stay! I hope to be back :)"

The room is big with a double sized bed, a bathroom, AC, Wifi, kitchen sink and a wardrobe. Their rooms are all same sized with different facilities (water heater, TV, refrigerator) each depends on what you need and availability. It has two gazebos (they called it Bale Bengong (Balinese gazebos)). They swept the garden everyday and you can ask them to clean your room if you want. They also change your bedcover if you want. They also have a food stall (warung) next door. The owner live nearby and can be reach via Whatsapp with the number written on the nameplate.","My kost while I'm working in Bali. This place is clean and cozy, made me really enjoy my stay. There are gazebos to enjoy your free time, fast wifi, and quiet neighborhood (which important for a worker).

Not to mention there are beaches nearby: Kedonganan, Balangan, etc. (I didn't get to explore more unfortunately). The owner, Pak Komang, and his wife are really nice. They will quickly resolve your problem right away. Thank you so much for your kindness Pak. If I get a job in Jimbaran again, I will definitely stay in this kost."

Very Average coffee with a higher price tag 🏷️, $3.40 for a coffee , a lot better around in this area , very small cups of coffee for the price tag! Found the service little slow!

Don't Accept the wise card (it's 2023), and didn't have any change at first, unfortunately we won't be back but thanks 🙏 anyway, shame we are staying 3-5 mins away this would of been our local coffee ☕️ shop! Place was very quite! 5/10!
