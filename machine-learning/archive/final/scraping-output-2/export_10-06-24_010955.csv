Their room has been well-known to have a colourful vibrant yet simple clean and functional set up with considereable price of a city hotel.

Breakfast and food are always great and flawless on each business visit and vacation.","It was the birthday of the King of my country. Unbelievable, so much food there was. I don't think it's right, in a country where many people have difficulty getting food, to put so much food and snacks on the table.  is MADNESS, yes actually scandalous. And to know that this is at every NL Embassy all over the world... I have no words for it.","We booked not the cheapest room, but when we came we were obliged to pay extra, it is unclear why.
The room itself looks very dull and cheap, especially the entrance part, cheap sink, headset and the front door, behind which you can hear sounds.
It is not clear how to turn off the light on the balcony, and the lack of normal curtains, and as a consequence not complete darkness in the room at night
Very light cheap doors in the bathroom.
But a lot of nice little things, soap, shampoo, a good disposable toothbrush, toothpaste, slippers.
Great soft bed, but only 2 pillows.
And breakfast was very small and meager, 8 dishes, omelet, and some fruit and sweets.
Everything is only Indonesian.","Stayed here for a stop, but had a pleasant stay. Room was so comfortable and spacious. Amenities were great. Staffs were helpful. Lovely place","I stayed here and it wasn‚Äôt all the great. They repeated the towels. No new towels
were given in the room. After the first day they don‚Äôt give you toilet paper. I had to call every other day to ask for some. The buffet is not that good, but again it‚Äôs what you like. It‚Äôs $7 USD for buffet breakfast. Everyone is really nice, but problem solving is not something they‚Äôre good at."

The place was located close to Siloam Hospital, where I had my surgery performed.

I was first a little reluctant to ask to stay for just a month or two, fearing that I might want some help recovering from the surgery. Fortunately, the entire staff was really helpful and polite to me while I was there. They were also really kind to my homecare nurses. And the kitchen downstairs is a big help. Anything I wanted could be ordered, and it would be delivered right to my room. The best part, though, is how clean they are! I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Bali as a result.

In the end, I stayed from December until the beginning of February for a span of two months. I hope to be able to stay here once more when I have the opportunity to visit Bali. Suksma üôè","Rented standard room for a month, only stay for 20 days. Overall, overpriced.

Good value:
+ Love the furniture and color pallete
+ disability friendly
+ good security system (24h security guard and access card for each level)
+ The smart tv has netflix in it (access/account not included)
+ 6 min walk to grand lucky (for groceries)

Bad value:
- 3.5 Mil Rupiah per month for standard room, and it is said that the rental price will increase by 500k in 2024. Extra 200k for room with view. Already include water and wifi. NOT INCLUDING car parking fees, electricity, pillow and blanket. So, bring your own. I spent 200k on electricity for 20 days.
- The only thing separating the bed and shower area is a curtain, so i had to deal with water spills and humidity after using the shower
- The shower head holder is too low. Im 5‚Äô4 and had to squad to take shower
- It took 20 mins for the hot water to come after turning on the water heater
- Once a week they will turn on the power house/generator which super loud. At this time, do not hang any clothes on the balcony, otherwise it will smell like smoke","New apartment, good neighborhood, staffs are friendly and helpful",,

Super dirty and the room is so moudly. DONT STAY HERE,"This ‚Äúhotel‚Äù has been accepting booking from agoda but once we arrived they told us that they are not with agoda anymore. I have received a confirmation regarding booking and I have coordinated with them prior to arrival.

Location is in a small alley, one lane road. Cars/vans will have a hard time finding location. Avoid booking here if you can. Waste of money and time.","Just this week I witnessed two women from Europe attempt to stay at this place which they had a booking for. Antara and OYO are in partnership / have a contract for bookings. OYO takes bookings and payments on behalf of Antara but the contract ended a couple of months ago, however this is not communicated through to any customers. The owner and staff then demanded full payment again from these women late in the afternoon who were visibly upset and very tired after travelling from Ubud. No compassion was shown and no resolution to the problem was offered by the owner or management and respectfully out of principle, did not want to pay again for something that they already booked and paid for. Antara blamed OYO and said it was not their problem but this was not a last minute booking and OYO would have already received their commission for the booking and provided money and details to Antara. It was clear the owners and management of this place are just trying to scam people. Shame on you and this place does not deserve one star.
It also should be noted, when dealing with tourists, the staff, management and the owner need to have better skills and understanding in English. Either they legitimately lack the necessary skills to communicate or were just acting dumb as they had been caught out.
This place has had a few name changes in the past decade and it is clear as to why. Do yourself a favour and stay away. If you are looking for a nice and cheap place to stay, there are so many other places to go that deserve your business.","For the same price of guesthouse you could get better one.  There were no privacy, very unmaintained guesthouse, dirty towels, dirty toilet, water in pool was dirty too. The wifi was not working well. We stayed for 3 nights here. Breakfast was standart, i found hair in it . Hahaha...... I hope they improve all of this bugs","CHEATING!!!
at check-in: ""i don't accept the price (online booked). you can cancel (pay full price) or stay with 50% extra charge"".
afterwards: sorry, no english"
