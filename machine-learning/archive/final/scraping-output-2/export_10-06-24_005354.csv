What a wonderful experience of Balinese hospitality! I also loved their beautiful garden and home temple.
Came walking with a friend in the dark after a sick sunset surf session at Karamas and left in the early morning to climb Mount Agung. For dinner we followed Putus recommendation and went to the night food market in Gianyar which was an authentic local culinary highlight.
They‚Äôve been very welcoming, warm hearted and supportive, the rooms are clean and spacious, the beds are comfortable and the bathroom fully functional - shower with hot water and good water pressure.
I can recommend everyone staying here and will be back myself one day!","My experience in Bali wouldn‚Äôt be the same without staying with Yulie and Putu. Very humble people who make you feel safe and at home. They insist in treating you like family, attending every need and helping you in every way. Beautiful traditional Balinese home and a cozy clean room. I will never comeback to Bali without visiting them.","Do yourself a favour and stay with this lovely family, they'll take care of you like one of their own and make you feel truly at home. If what you want is an Authentic feel of Bali in a small family run property with amazing architecture (the home temple is stunning), and proximity to a main port, lovely beaches and breathtaking waterfalls then this is the place for you!","Yulie and Putu will make you feel like at home! They helped us to visit the most in our Bali short stay, from Hindu temples to local night market and volcano trekking‚Ä¶recommended if you want to explore Bali and get in touch with the local culture!","Thanks to Putu e Juli we have spent 3 wonderful days in Bali. Away from the overcrowded Ubud, if you want a quite and local place to stay, Serongga guest house is yours. Putu is a good driver and he organized for us 2 beautiful full day tours. Juli is a very good cooker and she was very helpful with my request of express laundry service. They have also airport service pick up, our flight was delayed and they waited for us without any extra fee. Thank you"

Edit : added more photos of the place, pizza was really good especially the tuna pizza.","What a cute little hidden gem tucked away in Gianyar!

Finding pop up was a lucky coincidence since we just thought about having lunch after visiting Suwat waterfall - and we were in for a lovely surprise.

The place is so lovely with open garden concept. Menu looks yum with affordable price, mainly serving fusion street foods and coffee.

The owner was really kind and hospitable even though my group is rowdy bunch üòÖ he even suggested us a cool beach nearby to visit.

Be sure to visit this place when you are around in Gianyar. Would definitely come back again if I am in the area too!","Nice place where hide from sun and get refreshing drinks. Tasty and very cheap, for all this together ~1,80‚Ç¨","Delicious and inexpensive food, large portions, very secluded and pleasant place, friendly staff","Cozy place for dinner at sunset. Kind people, great food!"
