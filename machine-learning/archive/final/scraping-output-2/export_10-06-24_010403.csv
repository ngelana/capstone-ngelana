I stayed in a dorm with 14 beds, but it was so much better than I expected. Clean, lots of space for storage, big shelf by the bed, lots of showers, so I never had to wait for the shower to be free. Mostly came here for Tino(sweetest dog ever), but met incredible people as wellüòÖ! Foam pool party was personally my favourite activity, but they have something going on every night, which makes it so fun to stay here üåûü´∂","We had the best stay in Clandestino! If you‚Äôre looking for somewhere within walking distance of almost all of Canggu here is your spot. Definitely the most fun parties were here too. Foam pool parties and shots are guaranteed!
Staff are super friendly and accommodating and the rooms are really clean.
I‚Äôve recommended this place to many friends who‚Äôve travelled to Bali and they all say the same!","First view is amazing, the hostel itself is very clean, the chill area and pool area is amazing, the reception is great and local staff are incredible. Negative review because:
1. No locks on the doors, had some random people coming in and out at 3am, turning the lights on and leaving the blinds open. 3:30am somebody came in and started making a bed that was not taken. What‚Äôs the point of getting a 6bed dorm, paying more than the bigger ones, if people in the middle of the night can migrate from one place to another.
2. No curfew and no security to ask people to calm down. Drinking own booze and partying at 2:00-3:00 by the pool area, shouting and drinking own booze - I get it, party vibe. But needs to be controlled because it‚Äôs impossible to sleep.
3. The foreign hosts - they are just there, but not really doing much besides getting absolutely drunk and do ‚Äúshot for a review‚Äù.
Im sure as a volunteer you can do better than that, they are not involving groups in games, instead pick one group (mainly with more girls). Just not the vibe, when somebody instead of bringing people to do activities together mumbles at the mic slurring every word from the amount of drinks they had.
4. The bar is very expensive compare to the places around - it‚Äôs a hostel, should be Backpacker friendly. Instead, it has prices as high as high-end bars in Bali.

Overall - it‚Äôs a good place, was really excited to meet people and have a party at the hostel, but the lack of control,  responsibility by the ‚Äúhosts‚Äù and no security present just ruined it and had to leave 1 day before the original booking. Didn‚Äôt even bother asking for a refund.",Clandestino is hands down the best hostel! Absolutely amazing staff and volunteers. Ella and Joe the volunteers were very welcoming and fun to be around. The breakfast and lunch is so delicious and the free dinner is awesome as well. There are events open to the public which are a blast and Christian is awesome when it comes to recommending places to go. Rooms are great and all the people are very social and a blast to be around! I highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a good time.,"Had a great time at this hostel, met the most amazing people, staff was super friendly and the food they serve is of great quality, the free meal is basic but very nice!
Another nice note! I forgot my wireless Bluetooth speaker at the hostel and after a week, I checked if it was and they kept it safe for me, thank you once again.

Would come again :)"

Thank you,Super yummy coffee and great food! Absolutely loved the eggs Benedict! The truffle scramble was good too but we both liked the Benedict a little bit more. The hollandaise sauce was so rich and creamy! YUM! The total cost for two coffees (one with oat milk and an Affgato) and two meals was 300k! Great price for what you are getting! Thank you! Great service as well and a beautiful environment. üòç Will be back again!,"Miel is serving one of the best breakfast and drinks at Canggu.
We tried different things and all were really delicious. The scramblee croissant if you like truffle is amazing. Everything on sourdough as well taste like perfect combination. We just love it.
The coffee got quality taste but its strong, take only one shot of espresso if you like soft coffee, then gonna be the best coffee which you tried and matcha latte as well is good.","Beautiful space in Canggu for a coffee break. Due to their floor-to-ceiling window, plenty of light coming in‚Ä¶ that said, the same feature makes the interior quite warm during the day.

Staff were friendly. We ordered the flat white - it was strong with a slight hint of bitter (7/10). The almond croissant was alight (7/10). Overall, it was OK. Would not make a trip to Canggu just to have coffee here.

There‚Äôs plenty of parking in front of the cafe for motorcycles which can also fit a few cars. There‚Äôs no shelter tho and our motorcycle seat get super hot being left in the sun for an hour.","If you are in Canggu and looking for a nice cafe for doing some works or just hanging out and chilling, then this cafe is one of the best options. They have beautiful design, with a lot of sunlight access. Enough amount of seating and some of them have power access so you can charge your electronic device(s).

Besides the design, the highlight is the service. They have friendly staffs and quickly serve us. The price is just normal.

The quality of the drink is very good and the food is just ok. Maybe it will be great if they add more menu varieties, and add more for non coffee options. Also, yes the seating is ok, but the seat quality is not really comfy, so it‚Äôs not really a good idea if you planning to have long work here."

The location is pretty secluded. I guess it's on purpose. And they have a small greenery area to look at

Enough electricity ports for everybody so yeah I can see most guests with their laptops here

Keep up the good work!","Amolas is a cozy place to hangout and have you breakfast or lunch.

They have both green outdoor sofa seating overlooking the padi field and a bonus pools to chill down. The indoor seatings is a plus when the weather gets too hot.

This is one of the cafe that allowed you to brings your pets with some rules that benefits all the customer.

The food looks and tasted great and surely worth it. Some will enjoy working with laptops and reading books here.","Wish I discovered this place earlier! An incredible menu with so many choices. Portions were large and food was so tasty. Great environment to hang out and chill, or even work all day on your laptop.

Will come back here soon to try more food.","It's my 7th time to visit this wonderful restaurant in my 3 week stay. All the staff are nice, food is great and not so expensive, and WiFi is excellent! Many customers enjoy their meals and work online I guess. Highly recommended for all you guys!"

I saw some dogs in the pool area - don't know if they are in house or from the neighborhood.

Edit: some guests at night were talking and laughing loudly on the lobby near the rooms - not respecting the people who were sleeping.

Edit 2 (four stars to five stars): I am very happy with this place, I booked for a very long time - feels like home.","Nice and quiet place to stay. With good view
Really good price.

When we arrived the receptionist didnt speak english but still we figured everything out.

Only they recommended a place to rent scooters. Most expensive scooters i ever had in Canggu and they were in a really bad condition.
So that wasnt the best experience","I rarely ever write a review, I am just struggling with this hostel so much. After months of travelling, that has to be one of my worst stops. No air-con in a spaced out room, I was exhausted as I had not slept and found the room was BOILING. I dripped every night. Couldn‚Äôt communicate this because no one spoke a word of English. Got bitten a crazy amount whilst asleep and woke up everyday with bites despite the nets around the bed that are old and historic. Such a let down and you can‚Äôt pay with contactless card even if the booking says you can. Just avoid","The view is the greatest thing of this place, especially in the morning time only.
But very noisy all around from local people and guests.
The dorm room is open, so you can hear everyone talking (on the phone, couples, humming) and smell the smoke from the outside.
Stay separately in private room should be the better idea if you can afford.
If not and don‚Äôt mind not peaceful vibe. Let it be.
The road to the hostel is bad.","So I will start with the nice part, the service is friendly and helpful, the pool is nice, the space of the room is big, and there is share kitchen, and the curtains are good and they give you tea and coffee.
But for this price there is, some part really need to be changed, we have a room with a view facing a grey wall instead of the terrasse field and pool they promise us in the website, the bed is broken and really hard we have back pain at the end of the two nights.
The wifi doesn‚Äôt work really well in our room, the aircon is loud, there is ants.
If you plug something more like the kettle the electricity of the room just stop ‚Ä¶
We have high expectations in the beginning specially about the view ect"

Unfortunately the walls are not very well sound insulated and we had neighbours who kept us up all night until 2am. I know this is luck of the draw, but a complete deal breaker for our stay. The large sliding doors to get in and out of the room are also lovely, but make a very loud noise when operating. So you can easily be woken when anyone comes/leaves their room.

My family opted for the meat-based ramens and thoroughly enjoyed them. However, I wasn't particularly hungry and decided to try their veg dumplings. Unfortunately, the first batch I received wasn't properly cooked and felt a bit doughy.What truly stood out was the excellent service from the staff. They were very sweet and apologetic about the dumpling mishap, promptly replacing it with a new and complimentary batch. Their attentiveness certainly left a positive impression.I'm eager to return and explore their vegetarian ramen offerings during my next visit.

One small note would be regarding the bathroom, which could benefit from more attention to cleanliness. Ensuring a tidy restroom would further enhance the overall experience.","This was definitely a great experience for us!

Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è","Rooms were not very clean and not well maintained - a lot of stains in bathroom, wall was peeling off and bugs around sink area. I reckon you can get better value with proper 3 star hotels.

Area is at main road so easy access around. There are supermarkets nearby.

And if you‚Äôre someone who sleeps relatively early, BEWARE. There is a bar across that seems to get lit EVERY night. It‚Äôs very loud.

Staff are very friendly and helpful though!!",Thank you very much for your hospitality at Casa Due. Specially thanks to Ayu who was very helpful at the reception desk and Tina for taking care of my room.,"The staff does their best, but the place is old and not very well maintained."

This place is something special, brand new, beautiful design, and luxury. The guest house feels like a 5 start resort, and has everything you could possibly want. I stayed their for nearly a month, and wish I could have stayed longer, the hospitality made it feel just like home.

What I loved was...
High quality luxury of the rooms
New and clean
Pool
Rooftop for sunrise and sunset
Waterfall shower heads
Very kind, and helpful staff

For some the location might be a drawback because its not in the heart of Canggu, but personally I prefer this because I quite, less busy, and you can still easily get to Canggu, or have quicker access to the main road which quickly gets you to other towns. Lastly the location is very close to Wanderlust gym, which I would consider the best in the area and defiantly recommend.","Overall, I had a great experience stayed at Rumah Padi Guest House. Staff was incredibly helpful, and the amenities were great. The room was wonderful, clean. And perfect location too, close to Berawa and Canggu areas.","Excellent guesthouse, and if you are in Bali during coronavirus they have a special deal. Good pool, rooms are good with good shower, staff are great. Cannot fault anything."

The rooms are simple but enough. One room though didn't have a window and the rooms where quite dirty and things like the red oyo bedding had mould.
We really liked the location as it was very quiet.
Definitely enough to stay a night or two.

I think with a little bit of cleaning and effort this could actually be an amazing place.","The family were really nice and the location is situated in front of a luscious rice paddy field. Unfortunately the rooms were quite dirty, and it reeked of stale smoke when we arrived. Luckily we were able to ventilate the room a bit, however the smell coming from the bathroom was terrible.
The walls were so stained and would really benefit from a fresh coat of paint. The bedside table was covered in something that looked like mould. Same with the tap in the bathroom. The bathroom really needs a strong dose of bleach to clean it. We didn‚Äôt get any soap or toilet paper, stuff we had to buy ourselves. We also didn‚Äôt get any towels but went downstairs to ask for one which they provided.
Aircon worked well, hot water only lasted for a little bit.
Good for a very short stay and for a budget option.","It's filthy. They're selling rooms that they do not have. Mattress is moldy, room is tiny with some creepy teddybears in it. Bathroom has a bad smell and is dirty too. I checked out 5 minutes after I saw my 'deluxe double room'..

This place has got nothing to do with the photos you can see on booking sites. Don't know where recent reviews are comming from - but it is not from this place.

Family is sleeping on the floor right next to the reception. No english is spoken. They were unable to provide an other room as they were fully booked. So I guess they were overbooked in reality and therefore gave me this last dirty room instead of what i have booked.

Complained at Agoda and received my money back.",Stay here for 2 nights! The view was amazing from the window . I stay here because of the view!.Cheap price. Also freindly staff. But  no towels and soap üòÄ. Because they said its not including. But still good if u want queit place for night time.,"For the price You pay, it‚Äôs awesome!
We were very happy, the daughter of the family speaks English okey and is very nice‚Ä¶"

The roof for 2nd floor is open so the room is directly under the roof, air conditioning heat might easily escape from the 2nd floor rooms. Place is near rice fields , and have the concept of modern traditional interior exterior thing combination. The access is so bad , car can't enter the road because it is so small and the road is pretty much broken."

Overall a good representation of Indonesian cuisine. Room is not air conditioned but is shaded and breezy. Never really too crowded. Plenty of parking. Very friendly and helpful staff.","We had a delicious indonesian lunch here! This place was just across the road from our hotel and we were so happy they actually serve local cuisines. We tried their set meal and we were shocked because the serving was good enough for 4 people even though it's only for 2.

Service was excellent. The manager speaks great english and explains the dishes patiently. The other staff doesn't speak english as well but she was very friendly and hospitable. Love these two ladies!

Btw the satay was too spicy for us even though they said it wouldn't be spicy. But everything else was delicious especially the soup!","So glad to have Sate khas Senayan at Canggu finally üôåüèª

Their Indonesian dishes are ones those never to be missed out. Craving for Indonesian comfort foods that is not only appetizing but offers great vibes and ambiance as well? Then Sate khas Senayan Canggu can never go wrong.

Ordered their Sate Ayam (def don't want to miss out), Sate Ayam Bumbu Plecing, Tahu Telur (favs as well), Sayur Lodeh (not bad for the first try üëåüèª), Nasi Goreng Kambing (spicy yet tasty). Overall we have good time and experience in this restaurant. Definitely will pay a visit again some other time üëçüèª","Below my expectations. Nasi goreng isn't mixed really well, still have lots of white rice & its crumbly. My husband get a yellow/ brown clouring - white rice. Seems like we get the leftover.
We pay half milion but all the foods are not good.
Ayam taliwang is not really tasty.","Delicious traditional Indonesian meals, great staff (highly attentive) and very clean! Would recommend coming here for dinner"

The menu, although new, offered a delightful range of breakfast options that were not only delicious but also beautifully presented. It's evident that the cafe is dedicated to providing a high-quality dining experience from the moment you step in. If you're in search of a fresh and exciting breakfast spot, look no further. This new cafe deserves every bit of its 5-star rating!","This food is just sooo delicious. The food is very selected, the ingredients have top quality. Everything is very fresh and tasty at the same time. You can make your own bowl up to your preference. I know there are more places like this in Canggu but this on is just different level. Even salad might sound to you boring, this one you will come for again and again because it tastes juicy and delicious. And their sauces just wow! They are all hand made, wide range and the taste is really good. You can also see the callories count with every dish which I find helpful when I follow the healthy lifestyle.

this place is a gem in Canggu

really fair price, amazing location for central Canggu and all whilst staying quiet away from noisy traffic

Wayan and his team are amazing and no issue is too small for them to sort instantly - he let me store my bike whilst I went back to the uk for a couple of weeks no sweat, legend!

I'm travelling around a few more countries now but I'd always come back to Bonewood next time I'm in Bali","It is a beautiful place. An idyllic environment with a small and peaceful co-working space. Your room is cleaned daily. Internet is good, everything works well. Staff are always nice. And Wayan is always very responsive, easy to communicate and ready to help.
