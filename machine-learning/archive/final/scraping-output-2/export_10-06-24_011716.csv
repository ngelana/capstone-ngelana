We thoroughly enjoyed our villa, it was so private and spacious. Rooms were cleaned daily and our fridge filled with snacks and cans of sort drink which was a great addition, Netflix was also available to use. We were sad to leave!","Stayed for 1 night in 2 bedrooms villa
I arrived at 2pm but the room is not ready yet. So yes we have to wait
Villa stated equipped with kitchen but once we arrive, they inform us we have to pay 100.000 for renting pan etc

Location was ok, Value for money
But no other reason to come back.","We loved staying at Hideaway Villas, room and pool were super clean. Great Hospitality from the stuff. Breakfast portion bit small but good quality. And location not far from activities","We booked 2 bedroom villas and it was amazing! It was big, nice and clean with an amazing sunset
Nice friendly staff
Easy check-in and check-out

There's a few things that bother me about the room tho :
- You can easily hear your neighbor from your villa which makes it uncomfortable and so you have no privacy
- Since it's mostly an open concept villa, you'll see some creatures such as snails and worms.
- There's no glass door just curtains in the living room area, so when it's raining, the living room area will get a bit wet.

The location was pretty hidden, with tricky small roads that can only be used by 1 car, so in the entrance there's a red light that should tell you when to enter, which sometimes doesn't work so that's kinda unpleasant.

But overall, I love our stay at this villa.","This was our worst ""hotel"" in Bali for a lot of money. We got the room here for almost the same money as in the Hilton, you can compare the quality and the possibilities. We spent 2 hours here in total, then went to another hotel. They offered us another room, but we didn't take it, as we had already read other people's opinions and didn't want to ruin our whole vacation with compromises. Please check the reviews before you book this hotel!

When we entered our room, we saw that the cleanliness and condition of the room was far from good. The floors were dirty, and there were noticeable stains on the furniture and bedding.

The hotel is in a very bad condition, the pictures could have been taken when it was built, it is not nearly like this now. The star rating should be reviewed by the accommodation agencies and not to deceive people.

In the bathroom, water dripped from the faucet continuously, the private pool can be accessed by climbing through the window, which is not safe if you are wet.

The air conditioner didn't work and since there are windows all around and the room, it was very hot, they tried to fix it, but without success.

The hotel's location is very bad, it is in the middle of no-where far away from the main attractions. When we declared that we were leaving the hotel, they told us that there would have been a shuttle bus, but they didn't say that at all when we arrived, so we think it's just for decoration.

The biggest problem is that we didn't get any money back at all, because we didn't book directly from them, so we managed to learn quite expensively never to enter here again."

Has everything you need with spa, gym, pools and restaurant. Great large rooms too that easily fit a family. Top breakfast too. Would/will stay again. Notice though that there is nothing within walking distance so rent a scooter or use Grab. On scooter plenty of shops and restaurants in short 2-5 min drive.

One suggestion is get a simple rack to hang jackets/shirts on in room ;)! Always nice and easy to have.","Very nice hotel located in a calm but very lovely area.
Very good breakfast and nice pool facilities.
I also booked surf lessons via their surf teacher Justin, which were amazing.
The hotel offers free shuttles to a lot of beaches but you can also get everywhere with Grab within 15 minutes.

All in all: loved it :)","I recently had the pleasure of staying at S Resorts in Hidden Valley Uluwatu, and I must say, the experience exceeded all my expectations. This hidden gem deserves nothing less than a 5-star review.

The staff at S Resorts is not just friendly; they are genuinely warm and welcoming. From the moment I arrived until the day of my departure, their hospitality was impeccable.

The restaurant has a fabulous menu that caters to a variety of tastes. The grounds of the resort are impeccably manicured, creating a serene and tranquil atmosphere. It's evident that the staff takes great pride in maintaining the beauty of the surroundings and providing a peaceful retreat within the resort.

S Resorts has a well-equipped gym and an open-air yoga space, offering morning classes.

I left with a heavy heart and withdrawals, wishing I could extend my stay. If you're seeking a perfect blend of luxury, tranquility, and warm hospitality, S Resorts is the place to be. I highly recommend it and look forward to returning in the future.","I dont know where to begin with my experience at this absolutely stunning hotel. My boyfriend and I booked this hotel as part of my birthday present, we chose to pay a little extra for somewhere nicer, and im so glad we did. From start to finish it was absolutely incredible, the staff, the food, the location, the cleanliness, the calmness, everything and I mean literally everything was top tier, I was so sad to leave the hotel as i felt so at home there. Im so grateful to have found this absolutely amazing little escape, I really hope to return next year. Thank you so so much !!!","Incredible experience. Like others said, the staff go above and beyond in making sure the guests have everything they need, and seem so genuine in their kindness. One unique feature is they grow a lot of their food on site - we talked to some of the staff picking mangoes out of a tree by the pool that I didn‚Äôt even notice was a mango tree.

The gym is convenient, spacious, and pretty well-equipped. We had no problem renting a scooter there and the surf lessons were fantastic. Justin is the man!

The menu was very well curated. We had several meals there (including the delicious and substantial complimentary breakfasts) and I still felt like there were more things on the menu I would order.

As others mentioned, it is down a road that makes it not so walkable to Uluwatu, but we either scootered or hired a car and it was no problem. Honestly most days I could have been happy just staying on the resort property, which is not something I‚Äôve ever said before. I didn‚Äôt want to leave when it was time to check out!"
