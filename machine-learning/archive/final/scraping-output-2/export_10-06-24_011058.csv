If you're feeling hungry or thirsty, fret not as there are warungs and benches available for rent. It's advisable to opt for a bench, especially if you arrive around 11 am. Snorkeling is a popular activity among visitors here. I personally arrived at the beach on a motorbike and paid a parking fee of 5k. The best part is, there is no entrance fee at all, making it a budget-friendly destination for all beach lovers.","Another gem of a beach tucked away in a remote corner of the island. What makes this place special is, there is hardly any crowd and this provides an environment where you can appreciate the beuty of nature in your solitude without being disturbed by noise of the crowd. It is like having your own private beach. A temple attached to the beach adds charm to the whole place and you will not notice how the time has lapsed.","Massive swells on this beach, makes for some fun & excitement in the water.

Cute dogs hiding under my beach chair to keep cool from the heat. üêï","Not as good as long ago when I first came here. The way to get here is kinda scary, but looks nice. So many people on the beach. If you wanna eat or drink don't worry there are some warung and also some benches that you can rent. Better on the bench if you come around 11am. Some people like to snorkel here. I went here by motorbike and paid 5k for parking. No need to pay entrance at all.","Crystal Bay Beach, nestled on the northwest coast of Nusa Penida, is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered by intrepid travelers seeking a slice of paradise.

We came to crystal bay as part of a 3 stop snorkelling tour in the hope to see manta rays.
Regretfully no manta rays for us today as manta rays too have an ‚Äòoff season‚Äô. At this time of the year you are lucky to see them once or twice a week.
Crystal bay was quite busy with boats - also hoping for manta.
Snorkelling spots with the exception of mangrove point all had a strong current. Our 11 year old, who can swim quite confidently, struggled and needed to sit on the boat for the majority of the 2-3 hour tour. If you are taking your kids and you have your own goggles/snorkle from home - use them as it‚Äôs one less thing your child will have to adjust to. The fins and mask didn‚Äôt fit him properly and he didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much as we wanted.","We snorkeled here from a boat on a Tuesday afternoon in April.  There were other boats there, but it was not crowded this time of day.
Water was very clear, beautiful fish abundant, coral was nice.  I followed a sea turtle around for a while.
Water temp was intermittently warm & cold.  Avoid getting too close to the cliffs & surf.
Overall excellent experience!","Was here on 30/07-01/08 2022 to see the molas!
30/07 1st dive water temperature 23-24C no mola
31/07 2nd dive water temperature 24C about 1.5-1.8meter mola! I was very lucky because everyone was waiting in the deep area and I was just enjoying the shallow water on the wall, thinking that if it shows up I'll just swim there but then it showed up right in front of me!
As for the dive site, it wasn't as pretty as the other sites, there were a lot of broken corals as I suspect there's a lot of beginners learning how to dive here, every dive I would see at least 1 foreigner falling on and breaking the corals which is a bit sad.
01/08 2nd dive water temperature 24C no mola","We had better visibility here than at Manta Point, didn't see mola-mola, but plenty of other colourful fishies :-)","Good visibility, currency not really strong, 45 minutes dive and lots of different fishes. Went there with the guys from Nusa Penida Dive Center, also highly recommend these guys."
