Surrounded by endless rice fields that sway like a symphony in the breeze, this rustic haven provides a genuine retreat from the modern world.

The lodge's charm lies in its simplicity, embracing guests with authentic Balinese hospitality and an ambiance that encourages profound relaxation. The quaint yet comfortable accommodations exude a rustic allure, and waking up to the breathtaking sunrise over the rice fields is a soul-stirring experience in itself.

The lodge's attention to detail shines through in its locally inspired design and eco-friendly practices, seamlessly integrating with the natural landscape. The communal spaces, adorned with traditional artifacts, offer a sense of place and culture. The staff's warm demeanor and insightful recommendations for exploring the nearby temples and villages enhance the overall stay.

While the lodge is a sanctuary of peace, it is also an excellent starting point for cultural exploration. Whether unwinding on the wooden porch, taking leisurely walks through the fields, or immersing oneself in the local customs, every moment at the lodge is a reminder of the beauty of simplicity and the serenity found in Bali's rural embrace.

Highly recommend this place and hope to go again.","It's amazing place for stay, design combination of breaks and bamboo look very nature and Clean, specially the fireflies at the night was very very amazing, I haven't seen before.

If you are tired of the Tourist version of Indonesia offered in the bars and stuff around the rice terraces, go there.

Bali Village is a must-visit for anyone seeking an immersive and unforgettable cultural experience.","""I recently had an amazing experience with traditional rice planting in Ubud, Bali. This activity truly immerses you in the heart of Bali's rich culture and traditions. The local farmers were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, explaining the intricacies of rice cultivation, and we genuinely felt the joy of working in the lush and fertile rice fields.

Moreover, the surrounding scenery is simply breathtaking. The green rice terraces, clear blue skies, and distant mountains provide the perfect backdrop to this experience. Throughout the rice planting process, we also learned a lot about Balinese philosophy and the importance of rice in their culture.

Most importantly, I greatly appreciated the fact that this activity has a positive impact on the local community. It's a wonderful way to support the local economy and have an authentic experience.

I highly recommend the traditional rice planting activity to anyone looking to delve into Balinese culture, experience the beauty of its nature, and support the local community. Thanks to the fantastic team that made this experience so memorable!"""
