But I went with my children and everything was good.

Itâ€™s better if you wear water shoes.",Definitely a bit of secret waterfall. They have recently installed facilities like stairs and paths to get here so I guess you could call it a â€˜newâ€™ waterfall. I would be very surprised if there was anyone but you here. There was no entry price when we visited. Can be a little challenging to get to the waterfall as you have to cross a couple of bamboo bridges but overall not very far from the parking location. Get in before itâ€™s overrun!,"Best waterfall ever.
Natural and the taksu of bali is here.
Side of the waterfall, the rice field and the village was very beautifull and the people was soo friendly.
Wood carving of balinese traditional split door is the one of the peoples do here.
