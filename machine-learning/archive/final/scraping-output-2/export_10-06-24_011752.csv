The villa was really nice and clean and we enjoyed our night there because of this however the service is just BAD. Room service was almost inexistent, we tried to order a bottle of wine everything was out of stock and no other option was given to us to compensate. It feels like you're almost sorry to bother the staff asking them for something. We spent a good 3 hours in the swimming pool area which is next to the restaurant, we saw maybe 10 different staff around and no-one ever came to us to ask if we needed anything. We even had to ask twice to get beach towels and 2 beers.
The location is also quite difficult if you don't have a bike or a car because very remote. We asked to rent a motorbike from the hotel, they said no because the minimum hire is 2 days and we were staying for one day, we then asked what they recommend us to do in order to be bale to move around to which they told us to order a ride with the equivalent of Uber there. Very disappointed as we could just have booked a scooter and save a lot of money avoiding the unecessary taxi.

Overall we managed to enjoy our stay because we decided to laugh about the situation but I'll say it again IT'S NOT WORTH what they charge for and would definetely not go back.",Villa looked nothing like on pictures. Rooms smelled really bad and moldy. Furniture outside looked old. Its not worth the price. We checked out immediately.,"Needed a last minute booking for a villa in Uluwatu and was lucky to find this lovely spot.
Traditional Balinese architecture, amazing and helpful staff and plenty of space in the villa.
The only downside was the breakfast - which could be prepared a little better and limited choice for in room service.
The location is a little further from the heart of Uluwatu and the beach, but not an issue if you have a scooter and are acquainted with the area.","We stayed here for three nights. The room and the hotel itself is beautiful, but their amenities are lacking in so many ways that our stay did not feel luxurious at all. There are warning signs all over the room! The staff’s behaviour was too animated, trying to be too formal with fake smiles for no reason. We were tired and sweaty from a boat journey when we arrived, but wasn’t even offered water let alone a welcome drink. Our towels were small kid size. No bath robes. The free breakfast was just ok. The restaurant menu was a joke with literally 7 items on it. We ordered grab the whole time. Their massage was the most expensive in my whole trip and still the worst! I would not stay here again unless they improve drastically in their amenities and services.",Need to provide more power points in the room with universal type and the toilet entrance should have a door in between the room in order to preserve the Aircon and lastly please provide more than 1 card access

The bungalows are amazing. Good sized rooms, AMAZING bathroom. Great shower.
The room met all my needs, bar fridge, comfy bed, a little patio. The attention to detail is fabulous.
The staff are wonderful.
It's serene, tranquil and just am amazingly beautiful spot to stay at.

It is a little ways away from the hustle and bustle of the city and if staying for longer than 2 nights, scooter hire is recommended.
Sidewalk shops, supermarkets, lovely little restaurants, and tons of laundry services.","DO NOT STAY HERE!!! awful experience to say the least. Beds are uncomfortable, rooms are 100 degrees because the AC barely works. Doors are broken allowing Gnats, flys and lizards in the room all day. Lizard poo in our bed, wifi is awful, middle of no where, nothing to do. No restaurant or food of any sort on site so takeaway every night is the only option. Walls are paper thin so if you have loud neighbours, no chance of getting any sleep. Just the worst experience of our lives. ALSO do not bother moaning because the staff are useless, checked ourselves out after 1 night. Originally booked for 10 but no way we was staying there longer than we needed to, asked for a refund... good luck we're still waiting for a reply 4 days after checking out. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!","We contacted them because we hat to postpone our holidays due to the sickness of our baby (9 months old). We asked for cancelation or just moving dates (because they pre-charged our reservation). The answer was NO, “we cannot and we keep the money”. Wow, never felt so cheated + treated like this in Bali. We will come back to the island but definitely not in this place.

Hope you never have to go throw such a situation.","Nice hotel, rooms are clean and comfortable. Staff is nice but not very present. Also location is in a calm area, although there was a construction site near and you need a scooter/ car to get anywhere. Note that they also don't have any breakfast available, but there is a common kitchen and a fridge in the room so you can easily cook.","We stayed here for nearly 4 weeks when we were in Bali. The hotel is beautiful and the area is nice and quiet.

My favourite part of the stay was being able to step into the pool after a long, hot day exploring the area.

With so many beaches to visit all over the Bukit Peninsula in Bali this central location was perfect for visiting them all.

The only downside was that there isn’t too much within walking distance of the hotel, but that’s easily remedied with renting a scooter (which is possible to do with the hotel) or by using an app such as Gojek to call a taxi.

I would highly recommend staying at Lumbung Sari for an affordable stay, good Wifi, excellent beaches nearby and very helpful and kind staff who always made us feel at home."

We stood for a moth and we were very pleased. We felt safe to leave our main luggage in the room while we explore the rest of Bali and beyond over that month

Best thing was to arrive and have a motorbike already waiting for you that the staff organised

The location is 15/20 mins from the main surf spots, restaurants and shops in Uluwatu

Staff is amazing they helped us so many times with all we need!

Alex a big thank you for you!

Rooms are very simple and spacious. They have cleaning service once every week.","It’s a great place to make it as your base if you’re staying in Bali for a first time and want to leave your surfboards or other luggage’s on a safe spot.

Best thing was to arrive and have a motorbike rented for a good value on the Bali market.

Owner tried to blame us for the black mould?
Scan through the reviews and you will see that her friends (that she’s tagged in on her instagram) are leaving fake reviews to get the ratings up!!
Do not recommend at all, took our money even though we didn’t stay any of our 5 nights","I come to the Sea Star Hotel for the second time, I liked everything, there is something to compare with, I stayed at different hotels in Bali. Great location, excellent beaches nearby, the hostess of the hotel is a super girl. Before I checked in, a bike was already prepared for me, rented in advance by the hostess of the hotel. Breakfast is super, the pool is great. The staff cleans the room all the time. The hostess of the hotel is in touch 24 hours a day, constantly helping with the organization of transfers, to Ubud, to Port. I didn't even call a taxi!"

This place is slightly close to south Bali’S Uluwatu temple and also the southern most tip of Bali, around 5km!!

Backyard is quite huge and the room as well
The staff very polite and nice..
Just love it","Visited one time for my friend's wedding party. The road from city to the villa is not recommended if you on motorcycle at night, the road was bad, narrow & so dark bcs the street light was like only one for every 5 KM. If you go with a car, or before sunset, there should be no problem. The villa was good tho, perfect for family or friends.","The owner of this accomodation is the most heartless business owner I have ever encountered in my life. My father paid $7000 for a month long stay; approximately 7 weeks before his stay, he was involved in major trauma and has been in ICU in a critical condition ever since. The owner has absolutely refused any percentage of a refund and will not allow a change of date for later in the year, when he has hopefully recovered. Obviously he no longer has an income and this accomodation is withholding thousands of dollars from a family who is suffering immensely.

It’s honestly disgraceful at the way this has been handled. She has been difficult to reach and almost impossible to reason with, citing her cancellation policy being 60 days. It’s absolutely absurd that a man who is in a critical condition in hospital is having such an enormous sum of money withheld over the matter of a few days. She is totally unreasonable and refused to readvertise the dates and is now saying that there is no time to find another tenant for these dates, even though they are in peak Australian school holidays.

It’s simply not good enough"

All the sales go towards aiding local impoverished Balinese people. Cash, transfer or can do card payments if you have a paypal account. Babi Richa was so good we ordered 2x with extra 2 sunny side eggs and extra sambal! We also got a mango shake, cappuccino, watermelon juice and an americano, all were high quality and fair price! Lots of vegetarian options and delicious fruit/smoothie bowls.","Simply outstanding! This is a gem of a place run by some real life heroes, no kidding! It was great talking to the team here while having our breakfast. All of the profit of this business goes to the poor and needy people of the area. Owners take good care of the community and always stand united to support the underprivileged people.

I don't have any comments on the food and coffee as they are simply amazing! I wish you guys all the best and keep doing what you are doing, wishing all the success! Cheers!","Staff is lovely and it's for a good cause knowing you give back to the community.

Avocado juice and cappuccino was tasty however we ordered Nutella crepe and pancakes and was a bit disappointed as we were served one crepe with barley any Nutella on and two tiny cut outs of dragonfruit. Pancakes was served two but also with tiny pieces of fruit. I guess the disappointment was because in the menu both dishes were pictured with two crepes/pancakes and a side of (good amount) pineapple and dragonfruit.","Annabelle’s Café is really something special! The vibe is super cozy, and we really enjoyed our breakfast there. Everything tastes great, and it comes at a good price.

But the best part about Anabelles Café is the people who run it. The owners are super friendly and make you feel like you're with friends. After the first visit, we just had to come back every day for the rest of our holiday. It's so welcoming that it feels like home.

What makes this café even more special is its commitment to supporting and helping the local. This makes it not just a place for good breakfast but also a source of positive impact in the community.

The décor is really cute too. Every part of the café has its own charm and somehow tells a story. Perfect to start the day.

In a nutshell, Anabelles Café isn't just a breakfast spot; it's a place for happy moments, good food and inspiration to spread kindness and love to our neighbors. We met new friends and left with a smile and can truly recommend it to everyone. It's not just five stars – it deserves all the praise!
God bless the family!","Lovely little cafe a short walk from our hotel. The food was very good and the freshly made, ice cold watermelon juice was just what we needed on a hot day."
