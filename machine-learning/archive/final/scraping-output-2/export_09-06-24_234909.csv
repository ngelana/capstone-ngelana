ChIJGWgeIKwp0i0R7RU5rR-TeMA,Talasi Estate at Batukaru Bali,-8.3881646,115.0783432,"Banjar Biyahan, Wanagiri, Kec. Selemadeg, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82152, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=13868996816746911213,OPERATIONAL,+62 811-3889-904,,"cafe, food",4.9,356,,"Perfect place for relaxing, drink a coffee, hot chocolate, eating salad and healthy foods. This place also manufacturing arrack (wine) made with Cilembu’s Sweet Potato named Karusotju, Karu mean from Batukaru and Sotju inspiring by japanesse wine maker. They are selling chasew nuts, organic vinegar, coffee bean, and honey as well.","Came here for a meal and an Arak tasting. Beautiful place with beautiful views. However, we didn't get to sample all 4 drinks available for some reason like the people after us did and only sampled 2. I queried why when paying our bill and was then offered a sampling. But I said next time. We came back later after they were closed wanting to buy a bottle and they went out of their way to sell one to us when they did not have to.","It is located 1.5 hours from Denpasar, you will find the relaxing ambience. They serve the best quality of food and drink. You also can try arak made from yams which is very unique and level of alcohol percentage.","Initially I came here to explore the area and join a short rainforest trek. Rather spending the day doing a 1 hr trek I was greeted 3 friendly pups with a full day of fruit tastings, food tastings, and product exploration of the Talasi brand. I was immersed in a wonderful experience that exceeded my expectations.

I highly recommend stopping by to spend time in nature and taste only farm to table dishes that celebrates Bali’s natural farms and plantations.

Everyone must try the cashew butter AND the raw chocolate milk. Ask for Pak Wayan to take you around and enjoy spending time climbing on vines and eating freshly picked fruits.","Beautiful estate with fresh, single-origin foods straight from the farm to the table. The nasi campur and sate babi were the highlights of our meal here, along with their kaskara tea and diverse selection of honeys.

Make sure to go trekking on the rainforest walk with Pak Wayan to get the full Talasi experience. If you’re lucky, you might find a few ripe passion fruits straight from the vine along the way.

In summary: Deliciously fresh food, warm and friendly service, gorgeous estate and view. Will definitely return and recommend to the folks back home."

The atmosphere, the architecture, very friendly and nice staff. We came here for dinner last night and had a good bottle of wine. We thought we would treat ourselves as the prices were high. The food was presented wonderfully but to our surprise it was just ...terrible. We couldn't believe it. We had a chicken curry which was just tasteless, a crab salad that stank like old seafood and had nothing to do with crab meat and we had a Cubano sandwich which was more like a simple BLT. We didn't finish the food and left early, I was seriously thinking someone is pranking us (until I had to pay the bill). Be careful. But if you go there for reasons other than food then this can be a nice place for you.","Isolated 5 stars hotel in the middle of amazing forest. You will be able to find peace and calm around the hotel. However you will heavily rely on the hotel hospitality, like food at all meal, massage, and nothing to explore other than the woods.

The food which served by the hotel is surprisingly not tasty. It is nothing bad but tasteless meals. I couldn't eat there for 3 days every single meal. I tried many times local food and I love it. But there wasn't many options there. But the dinner at the hotel which was not at all tasty.

The massage was amazing. The pool is clean. The room is great. Besides we found a small scorpion chilling in the bed one morning. We heard an amazing bird and we spot it twice.

Over all, I like the hotel. Only one thing I wish they do, improve the food taste. Serve more local food.","A few villas in a lush tropical rain forest.
Service is excellent and the houses are very well decorated.
We had a bit of rain during our 3 days stay so everything was humid, but I guess this is part of the experience.
The food was also very good.
If you have the opportunity, take a tour with one of the staff members in the rice paddies and in the jungle, it's really interesting.","This could have been a great place. Nice houses, nice interior. Secluded.  But that’s now enough to make it a good stay. There was Construction going on at the hotel. The motorbikes drive fast outside of the hotel so its noisy. It was way more quite inside our hotel in ubud town then In the jungle which is a bit weird. They have dogs running around , sleeping next to the pool. The above is not too bad and can be accepted. But the worst thing is the food, which brings the hotel from 4 to 2 stars. Totally tasteless and expensive. I bet that the chef would never eat it himself. Any local food (fried chicken with rice or whatever tastes better). The closest local restaurant is 30 min away with motorbike. Step it up guys, a bit more effort and this could be a 4/5 star.","A special location where you can switch off from the stress and noise of the world and recharge.  The setting is high up on a mountain within a beautiful tropical jungle. The bird life is gorgeous to watch and listen to from your Villa. Enjoy fabulous food, warm hospitality, and absolute privacy.
If you are after a unique experience away from the bars, shopping and noise of the Bali tourist scene then this is it.  You will come back renewed."
ChIJ89HTNvEp0i0RHIA_iqoxn5c,Batukaru Mountain Farmstay,-8.389263999999999,115.0804309,"Banjar Anyar, Penebel, Tabanan Regency, Bali 82152, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=10925505829557731356,OPERATIONAL,+62 821-4409-0603,farmstay,"farmstay, lodging",4.9,28,,"We stayed at Batukaru Mountain Farmstay for 8 days and enjoyed every minute of it. What a lovely place! Very peaceful and remote, close to the jungle. The huts are basic, but have a nice atmosphere of authenticity. Simon is from the UK who came here some ten years ago to release some stress from his busy job in the IT business in England, and just never left. He's an excellent host who knows a lot about Balinese culture, religion and nature. He speaks perfect Balinese and everyone in the village knows him and treats him as family. His crew of local boys take care and serve delicious Balinese food. Not the standard tourist food, we had several vegetables we never ate before, like water spinach, fern, and cassave leaves. All fresh from the farm, and just lovely.

Simon wants to do tourism in a different way than in most places in Bali. For him it’s important to preserve the Balinese culture and religion and make sure there’s a mutual respect and understanding between the locals and their guests, the tourists. And that’s a totally different approach from what you find in the main touristic areas in Bali. So if you’re looking for a beautiful and quiet place to stay, with respect and in balance with nature and culture, then Batukaru Farmstay is a wonderful place to go to, and highly recommended.","Batukaru Mountain Farmstay is a refreshing change from the touristy attractions in Bali. We were blown away by the lush forestry and plants. When night falls, it's an experience to be surrounded by the sounds of nature.

During our short stay here, we went on a guided hike through a rainforest with Arta. Interacting with him gave us meaningful insights into the Balinese culture that we wouldn't have gotten anywhere else on our trip. We also appreciate Simon for his regular check-ins to ensure we are comfortable there, as well as for sharing his Batukaru experience (which is quite an inspiration).Venturing out is easy with a scooter, and we went to a hotspring in a nearby town.

It is also a perfect place to be with yourself for a while. It is rather easy to separate from most of the distractive things that are so common in our civilized world.

And lastly, our happy spirits were accompanied by very happy and full bellies. The food that they served are typical Balinese, which we find delicious.

We are so glad we found this place and highly recommend this experience to anyone looking to be closer to nature and the local people. Hope to be back one day!","I loved my time at Batukaru Farmstay. Simon was an amazing host who made sure I had everything I needed from the moment I arrived. He's very knowlegable in all things Balinese culture. If you want to experience village life in Bali than look no further.

The accommodation is simple but comfortable, surrounded in thick, lush jungle. The food prepared daily by the boys if you choose to eat here is exceptional. Lunch and dinner were the highlights of my stay.

It's the type of place to read a book, write a book or simply soak up the serenity. I'll most definitely be back.

Cheers team for an enjoyable stay.","For anyone seeking a refreshing getaway in one of the most beautiful and remote areas of Bali, look no further. As so many previous reviews have pointed out, our stay at the bamboo cabin was the highlight of our time in Indonesia.

From the moment we arrived, we were super impressed with the welcoming touch from Simon (the host) and his team. This is not the place for posh travelers who expect an elegant experience - the unit is literally in the Indonesian jungle, and if you so choose, you will have fantastically mesmerizing experiences with the surrounding nature.

As a result, you will also have the unique chance to understand what true Balinese life is like outside of the dense tourist areas. Simon offers optional food packages, which you must try at least once. His chefs use locally grown ingredients and prepare meals better than most places I've found in Ubud, Canggu, etc. Overall, we're super happy we chose to stay in the village, and will encourage any friends visiting Bali to check it out as well. Thank you again, Simon and friends!","Great location, awesome host. And very good vegan food Indonesian with some unique flavors. (They have meat if you request it.)
The only thing that wasn't perfect was that the towels and sheets seemed to be a bit damp and the light in the first hut we stayed in was very cold. Not so romantic...But that can easily be fixed with a few candles. 😊

We also loved the whole concept behind this farmstay. Simon is doing great work for the community up there! Definitely worth supporting ❤️"
