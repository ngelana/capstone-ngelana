ChIJCyHYpraF0S0R2g5a8B_H-Gs,Mesusun waterfall,-8.2036217,115.00751100000001,"Jln, Cempaga, Kec. Buleleng, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81152, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=7780187296272879322,OPERATIONAL,+62 878-4434-2562,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.5,24,,Nice little waterfall. The drive up road and walk to waterfall was cool. The path isn't  marked that well but I just asked people for directions. Met lovely lady with young family living near falls. She said there were other waterfalls near Mesusun falls that were better and weren't on Google. Ill have to go back and find these. Overall a good little workout to get to falls. Great day.,"Best waterfall we’ve seen by far in Bali. Stunning location, secluded (we didn’t see anyone else), no entrance fee and the 2 young lads who guided us along and down the steep and narrow trail were polite and well worth a tip. The local villagers are currently improving the trail, planting lots of saplings, the views will be even better in the future.","A very beautiful waterfall! There wasn't much signage but at the maps checkpoint there was a very nice family that let us park and then took us down a 15 minute path to the waterfall and we wouldn't have known which path to take without them. I'm not sure if they expected money or not but we paid them for their time and efforts, so if you go make it worth their while as well because it is worth it. They also gave us some homemade snacks when we were done.","the place is very beautiful, very suitable for recreation. so it is highly recommended to visit","Nice place for healing so peace full but little bit hard the access,need attention the step and slipery especially on rainin  season"
