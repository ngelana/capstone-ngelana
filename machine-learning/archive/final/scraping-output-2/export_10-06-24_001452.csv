Their noodle is good and if you like spicy, order more than 10.","Just like spicy noodles in general. If you ask
for spicy food in this caf√©, then you can only feel one taste, namely spicy. You will miss the salty, savory, and other flavors besides spicy. I still gave it 4 stars because it's cheap food. So...","This place is good to have your meals. Many variants of food & beverage. The special is Noodles with any types of level from smile till explode level.  Many tables are provided to the customer. Though the price is affordable but the tastes are excellent. Bring your family, friends and coullegas there. In addition this place Mi Bujuh Karangasem has a large parking lot.

Sorry to it for the owner and the waitresses who served me and my friend tomorrow , Wednesday 11 September 2019 at about 16:00. We enjoy our ordered meals; Tommato juice, Avocado juice, RUjak Kuah pindah, Cap cay and Chicken roasted. But in the middle we enjoy cap cay we found fallen hair in the food. What a hell. Then We made complaint to the waitress she just say sorry while smiling. Without trying to lead us to communicate with the Owner or Management staff. How bad complaint handling. Who has ever had such kind of experience here?",Perfect place to eat. Cheap (20k for main dish) and tasty with cool atmo‚ò∫Ô∏è
