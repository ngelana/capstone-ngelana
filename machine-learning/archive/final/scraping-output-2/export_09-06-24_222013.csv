There is a small pura (temple) on the top for Hindus to pray.

The trek is made of concrete stairs.
About 15-25 minutes to reach the top.

There is no actual entrance fee, but a voluntary donation.

They already put some trashbin along the route, so make sure to not littering.
And there is a toilet too, so every thing is nice.","Very beautiful scenery! Entering the location you will have to give some donation for the local people to maintain the hill. It has a spacious parking lot, although the road is quite broken. We need to walk at least 1000m to reach the top, not too far, but its already on top, and scenery of hill is outstanding! I'm sure, you will have a ton of image after visits. It's just like a dream. Prove it by your self! Give a proper donation for a better day tomorrow  :)",Killer walk if you follow the trails through the village - so recommend heading up from Pemuteran Temple. Astounding views that are well worth the effort. Temple is very peaceful and humble.,Love this place .. I and my wife came there .  it s beautiful place on the top of the Hill . We named it Bukit Cinta or Love Hill . ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–,"A peaceful place with sacred Hindu Temple to worship to the god. And also, the panoramic view of landscape and Rawung volcano look great from long distance. Meanwhile, fresh wind swap the area and make it as a perfect place for meditation or relax while enjoy the stunning view. Moreover, the spectacular sunset at late afternoon will add our wonderful experience to visit this site."

A short distance from Pemuteran, Batu Kursi Viewpoint is a relatively short walk up some stairs to a great overlook of the surrounding hills, farms, and ocean. This is DEFINITELY a hole thatâ€™s worth doing at sunset. Itâ€™s spectacular watching the sun set over the horizon! If youâ€™re in the area, come here! ðŸ˜„","Very nice place to see sunset in Pemuteran. The way up is short but demanding although you can take the stairs but I heard there is entry fee on that side. You can find free and wild access from the other side using maps.me of following the paths. Is pretty simple.
The swing and the views of Java and Menjangan are worthy the climb!! The temple looks a bit disappointing so better stay in the hill with the swing.",It's a tough walk up a really long hill.   The outcome is worthwhile.   Make sure you take the right route here.   Google offers a few options and the official route is the best.   Take water.,"Nice lookout very easy to reach. Drive to the bottom as per Gmaps and walk up the stairs, took us about 10mins. Great for sunrise.","Nice hike up
Cloudy not much sunset view"
