Coffee and tea available all day, drinking fountain is available with hot and cold water. Every day they cleaned our room, made the bed and mopped the floor. One negative point of the room is that the drain was clogged and the water from both the shower and the sink formed a river inside the bathroom, which is a bit disgusting when we brushed our teeth.

I had told them that if the kitchen policy was truly the policy we will have to move out next month. They gave me an alternative policy and I did not mention anything on the matter anymore.

Smart TV with Youtube and Netflix etc. Quite a lot of dogs and roosters outside though so if you are afraid or are a lightsleeper it may not be ideal.","wonderful owners!  the room is large, fully corresponds to the photo.  upon arrival they met me with chocolate cookies, when I was leaving they came to say goodbye and presented a delicious cupcake üòä they cleaned every 2 days, bought me a hairdryer, a laundry basket and a bottle of water.  They did everything to make me feel comfortable!  Olivia took my laundry to the laundry and went to the store.  Near the guest house there are shops, which is very convenient.  I have the best memories of this place and the owners, I have never seen such care and attention anywhere else.  the only thing that got in the way was the roosters on the street and the neighboring house in which they either turned on loud music or scandals with screams and tantrums) in general, I recommend this place, and if possible I would like to return in the future‚ò∫Ô∏è"

Without the people in charge who were there before (nice, friendly, English speaking)
- the service is now terrible üòû
- impossible to communicate because no one speaks English
- the one in charge in not helpful at all
- I got my remote control missing!!!!!!!

Texted the WA but my message is not even delivered.

I am not going to this car wash any more except for getting back my missing remote control!","I am sorry to say I was not satisfied. First the entrance ramp is very steep, so getting the car there was a problem. The exit was even more difficult, I was afraid that the front of my car would rub off.
They had a price list posted there, washing cars 60K.  When I arrived after an hour and a half that it was done, the attendant wanted 80K. I asked why, when they have a price list for 60K. He didn't answer me, so it's clear that he's a joke.  I ended up paying 65K because I paid cash!!!  Just a service that I will never use again.
In addition to the unpleasant feeling of haggling over the price, the car was not washed well, actually only rinsed, but they didn't wash the interior at all, and the stains that couldn't be washed off with just a stream of water, either.  They didn't even look in the trunk, so they didn't even vacuum it.","Great car wash! Good location, parking area, waiting room with AC, kids toys as well.
Guys working fast and good! Middle price for this area!
Thanks to the team üôèüèª","Best scooter/car wash in town! Staff is super friendly, wash was done in 15min from arrival to finish and it‚Äôs well priced! üòäüëåüíßüõµ

Will come again for sure! üòé","This is my third visit here this month to wash my car.

Great result and service as always. My car was cleaned thoroughly, shining back again ;-D. The interior and glass cleaning were good as well. Totally satisfied. Suksme."

So we decided to go here for some brunch. Simple decor and ambiance.
Staff was polite and friendly
We were so impressed with their food/coffee/desserts, we went back everyday for the next 3days
We tried the feta cheese Ciabatta(sandwich)- it was heavenly!! The homemade sauce inside it, I think it was basil or something, was absolutely delicious
Personal favourite- chocolate muffin. They were moist and just amazing
Coffees were good too
Best part was the prices- they were so pocket friendly!
Highly recommended üëçüèº","First time coming to this cafe and it was a nice experience. We ordered chicken lebanese and beef panini. The chicken lebanese was REALLY good! And it‚Äôs huge portion (can be for 2 people I guess). I love the homemade basil pesto in it, I‚Äôd love to have more while my husband said he didn‚Äôt like too much pesto. So I think it depends on the taste. We both agreed tho that it was SUPERB. The beef panini was okay. Not bad at all! Although the lebanese won here. We took muffin also to try out and it tasted GOOD! Wondering why not many people come here, really. The taste‚Äôs good, the space‚Äôs awesome and the price is okay! We paid only 89k (for panini, lebanese and muffin). Will definitely definitely be back!","This cafe is located on jalan puri gading. They have variety of food especially for breakfast, salad, bakery, coffee, tea etc.

When I was there, I had their breakfast package menu IDR 50k which was included as you can see in the picture below. I love the affordable price !

I definitely recommend this place when you are near jalan puri gading.","Tidy simple place with good coffee (not so often you can get correctly made latte in the latte-glass) ‚Äî taste is mild, but quite strong. I also had a brownie that I liked and Lebanese with chicken ‚Äî the portion is big, so take care )). They also have plugs close to each table, so you can come to work here.","I'd say 3 or 3.5 stars. I don't know why the first time i entered the store i smelled strong cigarette smoke smell. This is should be a bakery maybe my nose was wrong, but this will not be my fav place. The breads are in 20k s range. Taste was ok. Place is ok. They open till night which is a right decision to do so. But the best is the staffs were so kind and helpful."

The first floor has bright wall and few seats. And the second floor has dark wall and more seats. It's very nice and calm if you want to work from a cafe. The second floor also has long tables if you come in a group. Both floors with AC. They also have very strong wifi. They also don't really play any music on the second floor. So it's perfect if you prefer a quiet place to work or study.
All staffs are very friendly and helpful. The food and coffee are also great! Anyway, really recommended this place for those searching a place to work while enjoying good coffee.
However the parking place is not very big. It might fit few motorbikes, but not for cars","The coffee and tea are delicious, so I stay for a long time.
On the second floor, each seat has an outlet and the Wi-Fi speed is perfect.  Kind and calm staff, hearty food menuü´∂","This is a brand new up and coming coffee shop, off-the beaten path. It has a carefully curated selection of food and drinks and an aery ambiance. What I like a lot is that the photos in their menu match exactly what you get in terms of portion size, aspect and quality. Good for brunch/breakfast or for getting a coffee and working from there (good WiFi).","Very nice place ‚ú®
Very attentive team, good vibes and atmosphere.
There are 2 floors - the first one is good for lunch or coffee, the second floor is like free coworking. Sockets at each table and air conditioning.

I put 4 stars, not 5, just because the menu is very small and there are few healthy dishes. But this is only because the cafe have just opened, the hostess says that the menu will expand soon :)",Great atmosphere. Drinks were good. No pastries or cakes etc. only full meals. Would have liked something to enjoy alongside my coffee in the afternoon.
