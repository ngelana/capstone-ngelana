Overall, it's an unforgettable experience that will leave you in awe of the beauty of nature.""","Well worth the early wake up for the jeep route, can get a bit chilly before the sun comes up especially when you are riding up on the jeep.  Bring a wind breaker or wear long sleeves if you typically feel cold easily and enjoy the stars above before sunrise (30-60 min wait). Once the sun rises, enjoy all the photo moments and warm hugs. Would recommend.","I recently had the opportunity to visit a real volcano for the first time and I was extremely excited when I arrived at the sunrise point. Our driver was exceptional, with impressive driving skills and a friendly demeanor. He even taught us how to pose for photographs, showcasing his impressive photographic skills. Overall, I enjoyed the tour immensely and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling in Bali. Watching the sunrise was an unforgettable experience and I'm glad I booked this tour.",Bought the ticket thru klook. The hotel pick up at 2.00am. The experience was worth itüòç Open air jeep trip from the base to the view point was around 30-40mins. They provide simple breakfast while waiting for the sunrise. The view was breathtakingü§©,"Watched sunrise on Mt.Batur. You can either hike to the summit or take a jeep ride. We chose the jeep ride. We got picked up from our hotel around 3:30am in ubud in a car and after a one hour ride switched to a jeep which took us to the jeep park on Mt.Batur. Waited for the sunrise, which was absolutely amazing. A recommended activity in Bali."
