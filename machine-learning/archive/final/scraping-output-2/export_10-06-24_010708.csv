I paid 375k too expensive hotel in my entire bali trip. I think We were only people booked this hotel no one was there.","The worst boat company ever.

No A/C, wet seats and in the tickets says that is 2 hours trip but will be 3 hours or more.",Place is dirty. The pillow cover was stained yellow from who knows what.

Location is in middle of everything and where the boats take off from though.,"Organised crime at its finest.

We booked tickets to go from Penida to Lombongan Harbour on 12go. The ferry was 45 minutes late, this was frustrating but not a big problem.

Then the boat went to the wrong port on the opposite side of the island. We showed the man our ticket showing where we should be dropped off and he said no from here you need to get a taxi. He continued to be very rude and despite delivering the transport service he told us ""it's not my problem"".

Conveniently, there were many taxis waiting eagerly and charging more than we had paid for the entire ticket. It was a set up to force you into paying more than double and for local taxi drivers to benefit. The taxi drivers were sly and smug and it was abundantly clear that this happens time and time again.

It was a set up. A scam. Avoid at all costs.","this is the worst hotel i've ever stayed in! the bathroom flooring is dirty, full of sandy footprints. the ac on my room (105) is not working either, i've asked the employees to fix it for 3 times but they can't do anything. so my room is hot from day and night. also the toiletries weren't even there. worst experience!"

The atmosphere was often off as it seems the owner gets upset if you don't buy their tours and they were loud. Also make sure to agree on checkout time: online it said 11.30 but again the owner got upset when I cleared the room at 11.20","ABSOLUTELY LOVE! on our second night here and just extended it for a 3rd night. Staff are wonderfully helpful, breakfast is nice & the free water is great. The rooms are spacious and clean- we‚Äôre in a 4 bed mixed dorm ensuite and for the price this place is fantastic; shower has hot water, double sinks and the beds are small doubles (which is rare in hostels) the AC is also great.

I went there to hire a scooter and the owner/manager Sibuk was amazing. Helping me out with so many things. You can just tell when someone is genuinely nice.

Especially when it comes to Western or Italian dishes. The food tastes great and will not disappoint. We ate at Nemu several times during our stay on Nusa Penida and each time our choice was confirmed. Most of the dishes are prepared in a very sophisticated way with attention to (tasty) detail and attractively presented. The location is a bit of a disadvantage: it's right on a busy road and lots of dogs run into the restaurant. Some appetizers and drinks are a bit overpriced. But the food has always tasted excellent. Give it a try if you are looking for tasty food and a varied alternative to local dishes and don't mind the prices. In the background, good speakers play mostly relaxed cover music of well-known tunes, there are a few attractive pictures on the wall and there is a pool table. You feel very comfortable there.",One of the most diverse menu in a single resturant the staff is very assertive and makes you want to come back. This is my 2nd time in last 2 months visiting Nusa Penida and I love the food. You must try the mango smoothie bowl and not to forget their Tuna steak.

Overall good experience.üëçüëç,"Great kitchen with a lot of choices for food and drinks. As it was just opposite Buyuk harbor, we had enough time to have lunch before we caught the speedboat to Sanur. The food is very tasty. Applause to the owner; those who really love food can provide this level of quality food and service. If you can't wait till the order is served, you can spend some time at the pool table, which is free to use. It's a highly recommended restaurant if you are in Nusa Penida."

Best pillows I have ever had in a hotel on a nice comfy bed. The views are amazing and the pool was lovely. Breakfast was nice with a good variety although it would be nice to have a choice of juices as I don‚Äôt like watermelon and that was the only option. We had lunch there one day and the food was on par with the restaurants in the area.
The location is a bit out of the way which wasn‚Äôt a huge issue for us as we rented a scooter from the hotel. That said there wasn‚Äôt many hotels down next to the bars on the beach and we picked this as it looked nice.
Would definitely recommend","Lovely place on top of a hill overlooking the ocean, avoiding the busy road by the shore yet it‚Äôs so close to the beach. Rooms are clean, spacious and cool. Pool is amazing.

We found the north of Nusa Penida is the best tactical place to stay, as all the best sights are only a 40 minute drive away tops, to every direction. And also amazing beach bars.","A very good hotel. We really enjoyed our stay! The complete hotel is very clean and modern. The view is amazing and the staff is wonderful friendly. You can eat, get drinks or massages at the hotel and some other smaller services. The hotel was very calm and quiet when we where there. Perfect for a relaxed stay. The Location is also quiet okay. Maximum of 50 min scooter drive to any beach on the island. Cal really recommend.","We spent our Christmas at The Kama and it was wonderful. The resort is managed by super attentive and kind staff who are ready to help in any moment. The atmosphere and the location itself is pristine, with high quality rooms and gorgeous designs. The food was also really good, we only ate breakfast there, but everything tasted very delicious.

The only issue we faced was that one of the drains in our room (7) smelled quite bad, but we didn't complain as we only stayed for 2 nights, it was okay. But other than this improvement point, the resort is fantastic and I would absolutely stay here again!","The hotel itself is at prime location to transfer to East then West side of the island. Not many hotels in the island offer such breathtaking view of the mountain while in walkable distance.

It could have been better if the hotel upgrades their bathroom and drainage system.

Other than that, we‚Äôre happy for the price we paid."

Nestled in a serene location, the hotel exudes a beautiful and cozy ambiance that instantly puts visitors at ease.

One of the most captivating aspects of this hotel is undoubtedly its mesmerizing sea view. From the moment you step onto the property, you're greeted with breathtaking vistas of the ocean, creating a sense of tranquility and awe-inspiring beauty. Whether you're lounging on your room's balcony or enjoying a meal at the hotel's restaurant, the panoramic view of the sea is an ever-present delight.

Beyond its stunning surroundings, what truly sets Gara Gara Sea View Hotel apart is its exceptional staff. The entire team is not only courteous and welcoming but also goes above and beyond to ensure guests have a memorable stay. Whether you need assistance with planning activities, arranging transportation, or simply have a question about the area, the staff is always readily available to help.

However, it's worth noting that due to the hotel's popularity and limited number of rooms, securing a booking can be a challenge. The high demand for accommodations means that rooms are often fully booked, so it's advisable to plan your trip well in advance and be prepared to snatch up any available reservations as soon as they become available.

Overall, my experience at Gara Gara Sea View Hotel was nothing short of exceptional. From the stunning sea views to the warm hospitality of the staff, every aspect of my stay surpassed expectations. If you're looking for a tranquil retreat with unparalleled beauty and impeccable service, this hotel is the perfect choice.","Great place to stay if you at in nusa penida. The staff here are super helpful and friendly. The room was perfect, a/c worked very well bathroom was clean and the pool was great.

The garden is impressive with the variety of plants and kept neat and clean. The staff even gave us a free lift to the very good restaurant Medaran down the hill at night with was extremely appreciated.

The tours also organised by the property was worth the money as we took the west side tour","We booked the hotel for 2 nights for our Nusa Penida trip and I must say that Gara Gara exceeded our expectations! The staff is really helpful, and goes over and beyond to make you feel comfortable. They provided a free drop van to the harbour, and also ensured we could get vegan options in the breakfast. The welcome drink was delicious.

Speaking of rooms, they are really cute with a rustic touch to them, and the WiFi is really fast. The facilities of the hotel are also really well thought of, such as the restaurant, infinity pool with Volcano view, robes, free soda in the fridge. The open bathroom is also a fun touch!

Two things to keep in mind though, the water in the pool and shower is too harsh on the hair, and that if you've rented a scooter from the harbour and are directly reaching here, expect a steep uphill road to reach the hotel. If you've already driven around in a scooter in Nusa Penida, then you already know what to expect when it comes to steep roads.","A lovely place! You get what you are advertised for and they go the extra mile to cater in seconds to any of your needs (travel booking, scooter rental,..), which is much appreciated!

We did not try the massages, but that's also a nice touch and at such a pleasant price tag in comparison to most other resorts.

As a foodie, I would personally not recommend the non breakfast food here.
But the hotel still deserves a solid 5* overall.

Well done guys, we loved staying here!","A really comfortable and beautiful stay at Gara Gara! Purched high on the hill the views of the ocean and volcano are stunning, and to top it off the pool looks onto this view! Beautiful sunsets! The staff go above and beyond with any request, and they even offered to pick us up from the port on arrival :)"

The rooms are good.. Sea View only in rooms 2 - 5.
We were in room 1.. Than there are plants growing in front.
The room has a comfortable bed and enough space. The thing that's funny is that you shower in the bath.

Road towards the hotel is steep but with a scooter you can come by the hotel well. Within 20 minutes give or take from Harbour.

I'd book this again properly.. It had good value for money.",Lovely quiet hotel with a beautiful pool with incredible views. There were some communication issues at the start but the staff were very friendly. The food is basic so would recommend eating out for your meals.

The food is very tasty too, we tried the chicken satay (amazing peanut sauce!), Balinese beef curry (very tender meat!) and the tuna steak.

Happy to support local business! Their story is amazing as they do their best to source their ingredients from local suppliers, giving back to the community.

The best part of the experience are the staff who are so caring and attentive; they really made us feel at home and helped whenever we needed it. We enjoyed so much we extended our stay ! The pool is perfect for a relaxing afternoon or evening swim and the rooms are kept clean and well maintained. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Nusa Penida.,"This is the one of the most amazing stay I had.

A family runs the place. The rooms were good, clean, cozy. Communication was a bit difficult due to language barrier as they don't understand english well but google translator worked perfectly.

Aunt calls herself 'Mother'. She is amazing. Very sweet, kind and funny. The breakfast was great and she also gave us some extra portion If we were hungry.

Place is centre to all attractions. Best part is, they have scooty available so we did not have to run anywhere.","High quality for a low price. The pool was incredible, ‚Äúmother‚Äù help us with everything, she organized for us the manta snorkeling, the boat tickets, anything we asked for. The family in charge of the bungalows is so nice and always trying to help.","From Australia! only $60 a night its like living in paradise, my gf and i loved it here, helped us so much when we had Bali belly, i literally rocked up dying and they took me to my room, organised our boat trip back to Kuta and drove us there on the day... they really took care of us and let me ride there own motorbike cause they knew i was inexperienced... love from Chris and Sophie mother ","This place is a cute, beautiful, family run place that is well maintained, cheap and perfect. The reception lady is just perfect and the pool is beautiful."

Particularly enjoyed the chicken and tempeh, can highly recommend!","An absolute must dine if you're visiting Nusa Penida - their Seafood Nasi Campur which comes with Fish, Squid, Prawns and Octopus is something you'll be missing if you're based in the mainland.

Very, very popular with the locals for breakfast, with a constant stream of people buying takeaway. Grabbed breakfast here before taking the ferry home, and got an extra serving just because.

Highly recommended, very affordable prices.",Local as it gets with great tasty food for great value! Best Mie Goreng I've had for 15k!,"Amazing restaurant in Nusa Penida. Lots of food to choose from, and a very clean and spacious restaurant. Delicious food, parking for motorbikes, and friendly people.

The place is small (only 6 rooms) but very cozy, very well looked after.
The pool is clean.
Rooms are clean as well. Main issue is isolation, you hear pretty well everything outside so be prepared to come with your earplugs.
Hotel can organise all transportation and excursion, at standard prices but don't forget to negotiate!","Great accommodation. The rooms are little villas with a great view of the garden and pool. The best thing was the staff. They helped us in everything we needed, and even allowed us to do the laundry in the place (free service for guests). I recommend it 100%","They will say the booking is not showing in their system and they keep making money by sending the guests to nearby cheaper guest houses, without refund.
Almost 4 guest were sent out like us using the same technique. Please don't ever take chances by booking this hotel.",Great accomodation and great common area with pool and a nice garden. Lovely staff and I appreciate breakfast included. I uploaded some pics for you guys.,Very new homestay that has only two bungalows. 2 more are being built but there was no noise at all. Lovely garden and everything is clean. They have a small bar for drinks and a nice sitting place. The compound is located 100 meters into the jungle so no noise from the street either. The people are very nice and polite. We will definatly come again on our next visit.

Overall it was a very good experience:-)","Location is great, Room is ok. Bathroom is ok but do check shower and othere pressure. We are not able to take bath in our 2 days trip. Luckily one day is snorkeling and the other day we take bath at beach‚ò∫Ô∏è. Second there is no water in flush also after one day. Luckily there is water in jet spray. This is same for outer bathroom also. So do check it and hope you will not face the same. They told us they will fix or change the room but no one was there to do anything.

There is literally no one in property to take your request or help always or for any service most of the time. Everytime reception changes from young child to old people(I think its familly owned). If you don't want any service then it's good.

Rest the property is good, garden is good.","La Mogi Cottage is a great accommodation, the rooms are clean, the staff is very friendly, attentive. Good value for money, and comfy bed.
Nice breakfast is the pool so pretty, I like it here so much.","I can give zero stars if possible, horrible stay , don‚Äôt know why people are giving good ratings as this one is the worst stay we ever had during our trip , people say that this hotel has good and polite staff but they don‚Äôt even care about their guests .
No basic amenities in the bathroom , no cleanliness in bathroom and bedroom, smelly room , we had to change our room twice as the first one had dirty toilet and second one had a big lizard ,
Will not recommend anyone to go there for stay find a  better hotel than this-one as there are many hotels around. Worst experience ever.","Really simple and clean place, with very kind people. They also have a groceries shop which is really nice to have stuff next to your door. Had the breakfast as well which is simple, but for the money you pay is good I say. They also helped us rent scooters at good price and special request for keeping them another half day. Thank you guys!"

There were rusty hair still in the shower as if they hadn‚Äôt cleaned the rooms in ages. The sheets had stains and the floor was dirty as well. The staff didn‚Äôt speak a word of English so communication was difficult. Also no one at the reception from 7pm onwards. We were left alone in the hotel and had a question :/  Close to the harbor. Nothing like the pictures online..,"Absolutely loved this accomodation. The room was nice and big aswell as clean ! The bed was one of the most comfortable I've experienced on my travels , with freshly laundered sheets and duvet .

We had amazing shower pressure with a seemingly endless supply of hot water .
Breakfast every morning was made fresh and was always served with a smile .

The owner (Mr Ketut) was willing and able to help us with whatever we needed during our stay , and gave us a beautiful tour of the island at a very competitive rate compared to other operators on the island , and was able to help us with advice on getting boat tickets so we were not robbed by those less honorable ferry companies .

All in all I couldn't recommend this property enough if ever you find yourself on nusa penida

10/10","Excellent accommodation!
Very good price!
Spectacular hotel staff!
Highlight for Rai who, on his day off, took us to watch a local ceremony, bought our tickets back to Bali and even left us at the port without charging anything.","DO NOT STAY HERE!

There was sand inside the bed when we check in. We stay for 3 nights. We checked how they clean the room after guests check out and they don't even change the sheets.
The toilet was dirty and full of hair everywhere.

The man working there will try to sell you everything everytime he sees you. He came to the room everyday disturbing us to sell tours or whatever. So weird. No privacy at all.

I don't ask a lot in the places I stay in but this was too much. The hotel looks amazing but it's not. Never again.",This place is very unhygienic. The quality of water coming in our shower was pathetic.
