Tembuku, Kabupaten Bangli, Bali 80671, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=7682075061598538421,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-4657-4146,guest_house,"guest_house, lodging",5,7,,Great place location and people.i did stay almost a month there and is an ideal location to see the really Bali couture away from the commercial Bali. If you like the nature and waterfalls it‚Äôs an ideal location to use as your base since it‚Äôs close to most of the waterfalls with a 30 to 40 minutes distance.,"My husband and I were looking for an authentic Balinese experience and we are so happy to have found this beautiful place of Ketut and his family.
Our stay was our biggest highlight on our 2 month Bali trip. Ketut welcomed us with a open heart and invited us to himself and his family.
Together we went to a temple ceremony and were able to get an insight into their Hindu culture. We had a lot of interesting and open conversations and we were also able to ask many questions about their religion and about the local life.
In the village we were warmly welcomed by everyone and the children always waved to us and were happy to see foreigners.
We were also allowed to accompany Ketut and his family on an excursion. Along Mount Batur, beautiful rice fields and over stunning mountains, we drove up north and were allowed to take part in a family reunion. It was very touching to have these encounters with the locals. Encounters that will remain in our heart forever.
The house is located in a quiet village, away from the tourist stream. In a beautiful, well-kept garden with lots of orange trees. We were allowed to pick fruits and even vegetables, which we really liked.
The house is equipped with everything you need. A bedroom with a very comfortable bed, bathroom with shower/toilet and a small kitchen to prepare meals. If you don't feel like cooking, Nomen can prepare a delicious meal for you.
From the balcony we could marvel at the stars on clear nights and listen to the sounds of nature during the day.

We recommend this unique stay to anyone looking for something different than usual.
It is an authentic Bali experience that will be in your heart and remembered forever.
Thank you Ketut and his family!","Beautiful rural surroundings and authentic Balinese cultural experience outside the touristy areas. Welcoming and friendly host family I would definitely come back
Thank you all for everything üëçüèºüôèüèº All the best, Marl√®ne","It‚Äôs a lovely house in the middle of an traditional village. The people here are so lovely, it‚Äôs beyond everything we have experienced so far. We almost had to get used to it first üôâ",
