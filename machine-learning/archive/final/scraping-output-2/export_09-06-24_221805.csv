It was like trying to sleep in an oven! üòµ

The design of the buildings is wrong. These buildings are made entirely of brick and concrete the sun is on the  buildings right from sun up to sun down. The buildings absorb too much heat from the sun for the air conditioning system to be able to cool the building. AND the air vents are in the wrong place, the cool air from the air conditioning falls out of the room via the vents in the door while the heat radiating from the walls and floor is trapped in the room with no way to escape!

There must be better accommodation available nearby.","Place is amazing value for money.

So everything starts with nice, spacoius parking( got a roof here)

Rooms are clean, cozy, spacy, bright.

Aircon and hot shower.

Nice overall decor (its definitely not some kind of superdesign, but just pleasant)

Each house is remote from others.

Place is quiet. So nice to hear birds, not roaring road so bonus point for it

Small, clean pool

Stuff is absolutely on another level of hospitality - i made a late booking (around 23:30) not only mr. Ketut met me but also provided some basic food, that was a life saver after a long and hard trip.

My minor issue is wifi, it would be nice to have a bit better speed in my humble opinion. And  normal shower of course. Current one looks amazing, but usual one is way more comfortable","Wonderful accomodation!

Room: Very clean and fresh. High roof and beautiful architecture. New fast working air-condition. Lamps to read on each side of the bed. Big window to get sunlight.

Bathroom: As clean as well. Shower very fancy. Water not too cold or warm. Towels available.

Breakfast: American and Indonesian option. We stayed on the Indonesian one. Six sweat lovely prepared pancakes with coconut pieces. Local fruits. Tea or coffee.

Service: Very welcoming staff. Help you with all your questions around that area. Very professional.

Scooter to rent for 70k a day (24h) plus helmets.

Free WiFi.

Owner Balinese. No big corporate. Mainly self developed. Elsika Sari does help to rebuild a coral reef and to plant threes on the dry hill near by.

Our favorite accomodation on Bali. Hopefully we will come again one day! :)","Amazing place to stay in the north of Bali, cheap accomodation but amazing facilities. The staffs were so nice and amazing. Enjoyed my stay there and hope to back again.",Really nice place and cheap it‚Äôs brand new so super clean we were the only one staying there and the staff was really nice even without asking they brought toilet paper when ours was empty and a hanger for clothes so kind of them. It‚Äôs far away from the road so really calm and peaceful. We Highly recommande this home stay . Ludo & Mathilde

Tawan was very flexible and offered us two taylor-made full-day tours in the north-west of Bali for a very reasonable price.

We were picked up in our hotel and visited two temples (Melanting and Brahmavihara Arama - absolutely stunning) and the holy hot springs on our first day - the second day we did a tour from Munduk to Ubud with some nice temples and rice terraces on our way.

Tawan is such a nice, friendly, reliable and funny person! We really enjoyed our time with him and had two wonderful days in Bali. He really knows the interesting places and is not only an excellent driver but also a guide with so much knowledge about Bali and its unique culture. Great guy, great tours!!","Tawan is a great person and guide! We had so much fun with him during our tour and he explained a lot about the places we saw, the local culture and recommended us great places to visit.

His jungle trekking tour was also amazing and he was super considerate of our pace. 100% recommend booking with him!","We have booked Tawan twice. He is a nice and open-minded guy, a safe driver, punctual and reliable. We had a lot of fun and he introduced us to his culture and explained a lot when we visited two temples. We can highly recommend him as a driver and tour guide. Thank you for everything Tawan, we will not forget you!","This, this is the kind of person you want for a trip, tour or drive around Bali! Tawan is the most kind, sweet and helpful driver we've had on our honeymoon in Bali. He didn't only drive us, while telling us all kinds of information about Bali. He also stopped at all interesting places and offered to give us even more information about anything we wanted. The warung he recommended was amazing. This guy knows how to joke, be serious and also make your tour or trip personal.

üôèüèªüôèüèª Thank you Tawan","Tawan is the best driver you will find in Bali! He really cares about making sure his guests get to see his beautiful home island and truly enjoys sharing about his culture. he gave us the best price we have received since being on the island and the best service on top of that! He offered us to do a few stops but we declined and said we are happy just to go to our accomodation. However he insisted we see at least one of the beautiful waterfalls Bali has to offer... For no extra charge, just it of kindness. He then recommended a delicious local lunch place and waited for us to eat our lunch. He gave us many good recommendations and shared so much knowledge about his beautiful home! My face hurt from laughing so much, and we really enjoyed the conversation with him. His English with the best we have come across in all of our drivers!"
