For sure one of the best fried noodles we had in Bali and also the roti canai was phenomenal!
We would love to come back, but unfortunately we were just passing by that area. Recommendation!",Delicious warung style food in Kedungu. The rotis here are seriously top notch! Please try it out and support local when you get the chance!,"Me and my friend turned up at 9:30pm. We were the only ones there and Andy made us the most delicious dinner and desert accompanied by some Bintang beer. The atmosphere was perfect and Andy was so hospitable. I recommend to all!!! (the bread was home made in front of us, so perfect!!)","This quickly became my go to place to eat while staying in the area. The food is absolutely fantastic. The owner and staff are great cooks and seem to love what they do. I would highly recommend eating here if you have the opportunity. Great food, great prices and great people üôå.
