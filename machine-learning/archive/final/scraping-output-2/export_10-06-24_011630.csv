Great cocktails and food and the prices aren‚Äôt too steep. The staff were also really nice! We went on Wednesday night too, and it turned into a beach-club party. So much fun!","It's a great place to watch the sunset,  but I'm not sure I'd want to spend the entire day here.  The views are spectacular, but unless you go for a beach bed, you'd most likely be exposed to the sun.   Food was alright, but the beer was not cold enough.  The club is not as pretentious as others in Bali and not as expensive, but if you're looking for something cheaper and just wanna have a couple of drinks,  you can just walk down the stairs towards the beach and you'll find a number of small local bars where the view is just as spectacular and the beer is colder and cheaper.","Good food, incredible views, very nice pool and friendly service.
Note: if u wanna go to the beach down, during the high tide it's impossible to swim, very dangerous and the beach is tiny filled with influencers. However at the low tide it is one of the most beautiful places in the world. Caves r stunning, loads of small fish crabs and sea stars. Even if u don't swim, you can spend an hour exploring the sea life and the beauty.","My tour guide said this is the best place to view sunset so I believed him. When we got there around 5 pm, it was already crowded so we were given a table in the middle of the room with just a little view of sunset. There were many staff but they were not attentive at all. It took a while before someone noticed me to take my order.

The food was average, so I can't really say much about it.

It was a bit cloudy so the sunset was just meh.

The worst part of being here was the crowd. The smokers had no respect for others - just smoking everywhere really. The music was blasting so it was stressful. The crowd was loud as well so I didn't enjoy my stay here at all.","Not a bad view haha. We were fortunate to get a seat in the shade for lunch. We didn‚Äôt like the gin cocktail, however the chicken sliders and pulled pork loaded fries were tasty. Reasonably priced. Prompt service. Recommend."

It was one of my favourite breakfast places our whole trip. The 55k menu is a great bang for your buck, generously portioned and had great flavours throughout all the dishes we ordered. The service was great as well, the girls were so nice. I would recommend going early - we went around 9am and when we left around 10-10.30am there were lines out the door!","The food and drinks are really good! They have a lot of things to choice from on their menu. I LOVED the chicken katsu sandwich and the mango tango smoothie (which I took to go). Previously also had the tuna poke bowl, which was also very nice.
They have a lot of staff but the service is not that good. It‚Äôs not bad, but you do have to ask for attention sometimes. Other than that they are very friendly and quick with your order, so I wasn‚Äôt really bothered by it and the food is totally worth it.","Pros: brunch menu has lots of options. Food is tasteful, fresh and delicious. Highly recommend their Smoothie bowls. Not recommend their Ceasar salads since ours has way too much dressing.

Their coffee is very good. Strong.

Service is decent, not exceptional.

Cons: very crowded so food took long time to come. It‚Äôs a small open air cafe, interior design wasn‚Äôt spectacular.","Such an amazing cafe in Uluwatu! Service was impeccable, so nice and welcoming. The atmosphere was cute and nice location being across from Thomas Beach. I had the smoked salmon and cream cheese sandwich on sourdough with a side salad and it was the perfect lunch! Delicious, filling yet light. It is on the pricier side but you‚Äôre in Uluwatu :)","Awesome place. They have the best coffee, we also loved the homemade fries and the burgers (beef and fish). We received our food really fast. The staff were very friendly and polite. There‚Äôs a lot of place to sit inside. They also sell cool merch - it would be great to get some smaller, female-sized t-shirts.

We ordered spiced cauliflower, fire roasted eggplant dip and orecchiette pasta as our main dishes and they were surprisingly great, especially the pasta. It‚Äôs vegan (a huge plus), and not too spicy. We also had a scoop of coconut sorbet (also vegan), and it‚Äôs smooth and rich ‚ú®","The atmosphere was great here. They have reservations. However, they gave us a nice table with a good view. The variety of food was excellent and the taste was fantastic. The staff were friendly and knew how to serve their guest and always checked to see if we needed anything. The location is perfect for watching the sunset, and the music was vibeing. The pool was fantastic and had good service.
Tacos are tasty, especially the smoked chicken.
Clams were big and delicious.
Falafel salad had an excellent flavor and combination
The eggplant dip was also delicious.
Drinks and smoothies were perfect
Salted caramel ice cream is a must for the ending of the meal.
I definitely recommend this place for a date or a night/day out with some friends.
Thank you!!","We came here for dinner without a reservation and it did not disappoint. The oysters are locally farmed and tasted great, but the eggplant dip and barramundi was what blew us away. Both were delicious and I like anything we‚Äôve had before, in the best way possible. Cocktails were refreshing as well, and we had a coconut sago dessert which was the perfect finish. The staff were also extremely friendly and kept us entertained throughout! My partner broke his glasses, and the staff was kind enough to recommend a place in uluwatu to fix in - that the detailed level of service and friendliness they went, and we felt so at home. Overall we had a great time and would highly recommend this place when you‚Äôre here in Uluwatu.","We arrived in this beautiful place for sunset without prior booking and wanted to get the best view (ü§£). Obviously all the best tables are taken.
we will try again next time.

We did not have a chance to try the food, however we enjoyed the ambiance and atmosphere so much so we stayed by the pool while waiting for our driver.

This place has amazing garden, but consequently there are lots of mosquitos by the plants and trees. Luckily we brought insect repellent and problem solved.

Next time we will book the best spot,  try foods and beverages and enjoy the sunset."

The spa is great. The sunset yoga was an incredible experience.

I LOVE that they take your phone from you when you enter. We could all do with a bit more time away from our phones. I‚Äôm shocked that some people are complaining about it in these reviews.","Fabulous views! Cool idea of no-phones. Did a yoga class - great view.
Good options for breakfast in the cafe.
Was a  bit disappointed that was not allowed to use the pool but paying g for spa session didn‚Äôt make sense as I would use it just for 30 mins after they close.","I‚Äôve been here last year the first time and now the second. Each visit was very beautiful and relaxing. I really appreciate that cell phones must be handed in at the entrance. Yes, you'll find some guests posing or being rude, but unfortunately, that's common in many places in Bali ;-) I cannot understand the negative comments directed at the staff though. They were all very friendly to us. Towels left haphazardly by guests were regularly tidied up, and the water in the sauna was refilled. There are free towels and complimentary water üëç. This includes a fantastic view of the sea or the stars at night. Together with an amazing atmosphere. I would love to visit again on my next trip to Bali.","There are some things I like about this place and some I don‚Äôt (I am reviewing the sauna/cold plunge day pass). The view is absolutely stunning and I love that phones aren‚Äôt allowed. The cold plunge is also pretty cold.

Things I don‚Äôt love are‚Ä¶

First, the locker/bathroom/shower situation. There are no formal locker rooms for changing/showering. There is only 1 closed shower for the whole area and it isn‚Äôt connected to the lockers. The lockers are in a tiny room that only one person can access at a time (with no changing area or bathroom) . Many times it‚Äôs a shuffle to access the lockers. So if you want to shower and get ready to go anywhere after your sauna session it is not a good place to do that.

Second, there are not enough lounge options that are not in direct sunlight. If you go early morning or evening this isn‚Äôt an issue. But in the middle of the day if you don‚Äôt get one of the 8 total shaded lounge chairs you are stuck in the dining area sitting at a table which is not so nice for relaxing.","I don't usually write reviews but this place was so exceptional that I felt inclined to do so. I set out to do a solo trip in Bali for one month, a friend of my brother's highly recommended The Istana and it offered exactly what I was looking for, so I booked it. A beautiful peaceful place, with yoga twice a day, an amazing swimming pool, a healthy restaurant onsite, a spa (biohacking treatments as well) and a great location with incredible views. I enjoyed my time there so much that nearing the end of my 8 days, I extended another 5, and then decided to return at the end of my trip for an additional 5 days.
I stayed in the ocean view suite, which was perfect, clean, and centrally located to the yoga space and pool, I loved it! House keeping comes every morning to make the bed, set fresh towels, mop, and leave fresh bottled waters.
The service was great, friendly, and helpful. The staff were always smiling and very kind.
Situated on the edge of a cliff, the views are spectacular, sunset by the fire is a must. As well, other restaurants in walking distance, Ours, and Mana (next door) are great. Also, walk to Finns, down the street, super cute area with local cuisine and vendors.
Overall highly recommend The Istana! I will be back!"

The menu is full of delicious options. We started with the Ulu fresh rolls and they were super fresh and flavourful. For mains, I went for the roasted veggie bowl with halloumi cheese and it honestly tasted like fast food. My friend had the miso sweet potato gnocchi and there were no leftovers (see for yourselves in the photos :)). Absolutely delicious. Very nice atmosphere as well. A really great spot.","Super nice and very friendly relax place.
Music at evening. Good breakfast and small area for kids to play. Staff lovely and careful for kids. Everything was perfect. Thanks again.","We arrived for lunch on a sunny and hot day.

The prawns were the best thing - the sauce is like crack so tangy and keeps you going back for more.","We loved our dinner here. Ate fully vegetarian but shared multiple of the small plates/sides all of which were delicious. One recommendation we would make is ordering a few starters then the mains otherwise it all comes out at once. Our favourites were the zucchini salad, the burrata and the crispy eggplant but everything was tasty and packed full of flavour. Relatively steeply priced for Bali but still cheap compared to a meal of similar calibre in New Zealand!","Great restaurant if you‚Äôre keen to play it safe, can‚Äôt really go wrong here and the food / vibes all round are good.

I would not say that this place is a ‚Äúmust visit‚Äù or anything too special in particular, but the food is good and the people are nice / service is as good as anywhere in Bali.

Our highlights were the spiced cauliflower, baba ganoush and the striploin steak. The chips were average at best and the broccoli salad is incredibly lemony, a little too sour for my palate.

We had a table in the outdoor area which was nice, the venue is very well put together and we would definitely visit again, just not quite the best meal that we have had in Bali hence the 4*.","First time eating here because the rating on Google is good. but to be honest, for me personally the food didn't really taste that good and I waited for the second food from the first food for 45 minutes just to make burgers and pork like steak. In addition, my boyfriend ordered pork which asked for medium rare when it was cooked and the waiter said yes it was made medium rare but it was made well done so it was very dry and not juicey. for everything I ordered 5 meals and ended up spending 100$, it wasn't worth it.","Amazing food, service and atmosphere! Everything was perfect. The pavlova and the wood fired bread desserts were unreal, probably the best desserts I have ever had. Thank you for making our time in Bali memorable "

The staff is nice and the ambiance, although unique, is overwhelming if eating inside. The food leaves quite a bit to be desired, with an overwhelming truffle flavor in most dishes. Don‚Äôt recommend the sushi. The tacos and meat were better. The desserts are plain and very sugary.","Impressively delivered / presented food, though the prices are also high here. I enjoyed the dishes they prepare right at your table, like the quacamole and the burger (the cheese is melted onto the meat in front of you).

Where were misguided with the 2 for 1 cocktails though. We ordered those and were told there is no mix-and-match, you need to order two of the same cocktail. We agreed and asked for the second ones to get delivered at the end of the happy hour. They were delivered after and for the full price.","Tabu Restaurant in Bali exceeded all expectations! From the moment we walked in, the warm hospitality made us feel right at home. The Salmon Nigiri, Beef spring rolls, Salmon Sashimi, Zucchini Chips, and Churrasco Picanha were all incredibly delicious, and the half-priced sushi made it even better. The 2-for-1 cocktails were a delightful addition, served in generous portions. Despite the tables outside being a bit close together, it didn't overshadow the fantastic service and cleanliness of the bathrooms. What truly impressed us was how Tabu accommodated both my love for sushi and fish, and my husband's preference for meat. The atmosphere was lively and fun, with great music playing throughout. Overall, Tabu Restaurant is now one of our favourites, and we can't wait to come back!","Meh! I don't get the hype from social media. I arrived in the evening, asked for a table for 1 and was told they were fully booked and sat me at the bar. The restaurant was mostly empty for the duration of the time I stayed.
I had happy hour cocktails, which had to be the same, could not try two different ones.
Then had taco, sushi and a side. The sushi arrived much later than the other dishes. The portion was small and pricey.
The cleaner was mopping the floor under me at I ate but she was nice and smiley.
The remaining staff were fine!

Once I finished, I walked elsewhere for a better atmosphere and better drink.","Atmosphere is good but missing the mark on the food and drinks. The scallop risotto was a bit too salty and scallop was fresh, flavor was right but the rice was hard. The drinks were too diluted, too sweet, not much alcohol. The sashimi trio- the salmon was good but the hamachi was previously frozen and old tasting. Good presentation, but the fish can be fresher. You know that feeling when you eat something and hope next day you don‚Äôt get sick? Look at how blockish the hamchi looks, the fish already lost its water content so it looks like a lego lol‚Ä¶. fresh fish melts into no shape. I‚Äôm from Hawaii so we eat fresh everyday. Yesss sir! Yea Portion was decent. DJ was amazing played great music good vibes. So i‚Äôll give credit where it‚Äôs due. Service was slow. But i will come back for their party and skip the food. On a Friday on a good day at 8 pm for dinner, only 20% filled for dinner, so if management wants to improve, i hope they read this :) they have potential!!!"

The movie night was great really enjoyed it and they came round with popcorn as well which was really tasty.
For food we had calamari, samosas, penne arrabiata and lamb rack.
The calamari was a bit chewy not the best I've had but still nice. The pasta had soft cheese in it which i didn't realise as it has the vegan sign next to it. The cheese is bocconcini and it's listed as well so that's my fault for not knowing that was cheese!

The second day we came to Ulu Cliffhouse we came to relax for the day. It has a really nice atmosphere and vibe but not enough umbrellas and when we asked if we could have one they said they were too heavy to move where we were, but they moved them pretty easy for the movie night.

Food this day we got a cheeseburger and a veg burger. The chips were lovely but the same can't be said for the veg burger, I really don't recommend it. It was dry and the bun was weird not a normal burger bun like on the cheeseburger so it squished the bean patty out when you tried to eat it. Also had some cheese like substance inside I couldn't say what it was because this wasn't listed underneath so I was really disappointed with this meal especially for the price.
Service can be a little slow as well once you have ordered it takes a while for it to arrive and the pool wasn't the cleanest by the end of the day. Best to enjoy the pool early before everyone's suncream comes off!

Overall a nice, chill place to sunbathe and relax, food can be hit and miss but I would come again!","A cool & beautiful spot for sitting next to a cool bonfire while watching the sunset. The upper deck with the bonfire is self served and it took some time for our order to arrive, but in the meantime we admired the stunning view, even though the sunset wasn't so beautiful that day.

The food was ok but definitely overpriced for the value. We ordered the tuna tostadas, the pork taco and the thai style shrimp & pomelo salad which were all kind of disappointing and the dishes were quite small.",Stunning view and great food and drinks. Outstanding value for money. Only issue was the pool was very warm and it was so hot we couldn‚Äôt really cool off. Next time I would opt for a day bed closer to the entrance in the shade.,"Made a reservation to visit this place for ocean views and hopefully a sunset dinner. Reservation staff handling the WhatsApp was unprofessional - they did not confirm reservation and was not prompt in responding. Severely disappointed with the views, the location, ambience and the food. Place was relatively dirty, ambience was catered more for the party vibes with loud music and party goers shouting. The food was sub par - the guacamole was terrible. The food was brown and slightly rotten - it was probably made earlier and left in the fridge for too long. Sweet potato in the guacamole which was extremely weird. 85k for a meagre amount  you see in the picture.

Meat from the burgers were burnt and fries were soggy. Pizza was fine. Food was relatively expensive. 700k for guacamole, burger and pizza and only water - unfortunately the views were not worth the price point. We left within 45 mins.

As always, the Balinese staff were extremely welcoming, kind, polite and prompt so all was great on the service side.

Come here for pool parties and with large group of friends if you want to party. Not a place for dinner.

Gojek drivers were unwilling to pick us up as well - we had to walk out in extremely bad and dark road conditions. Saw another review that apparently private car drivers are not allowed to come in due to the taxi mafias - that makes sense why.","Nice place to hangout around Uluwatu.

I found many friends here. Also the music is nice. If you guys love techno shouldn‚Äôt miss ‚ÄòCiao for now‚Äô on every Saturday night.

Stefano & team do a very hard work
Once you step in, they will greet you with warm hospitality & smile. Every details were taken care by them. Stefano always come & check on every of his customers(not only me, ofc!) to make sure they are satisfy with the service.

The drinks are enjoyable . I‚Äôve been here since the beginning and every time I come back, their drinks are getting better & better
Negroni is the best!! I don‚Äôt know, how many drinks I got from this place. But I do enjoy them all.

The bartenders can make upon your request. So feel free to ask something out of the menu and you‚Äôll discover the real happiness of cocktailsüç∏Ps. Limoncello is a game changerü§£ don‚Äôt forget this oneüî•üî•üî•

About the food, for sure delicious because they‚Äôre sister to La Baracca. My favorite menu is ‚ÄòProsciutto di Parma‚Äô The combination between cheese, fig and Prosciutto ham. Also love their pasta & salad. Never get enough.

To me, Il Salotto is not just a place but a  family. Feel comfy every time I visit and will keep coming backüíï",We came here for a drink after dinner. However we looked at the menu and it sounded great so we ordered a second dinner! We got the tuna tartare pasta and it was SO DELICIOUS! The tuna was so yummy and fresh and the pasta was cheesy and it was just a really well constructed dish. We also got desert and it was nice too! But the pasta was the star of the show. I can‚Äôt comment on the drinks as I was sticking to beer but I saw a few come out and they looked great too. There are some cute street dogs that come in to say hi too.,A gorgeous setting with a very relaxed atmosphere. We only had a drink here but we were still presented with a complimentary fish starter to try and a lemonchello when we got the bill. We didn‚Äôt get food here but wine was delicious and lovely big glasses. Will definitely be back.

The food was delicious offering a wider variety of fresh seafood dishes to wagyu steaks. The restaurant itself is as beautiful as the dishes. The perfect place for a romantic night out.,"MUST VISIT. Best meal and service we‚Äôve had in Bali. Our server was Ari and was so attentive and kind. For four girls we got the Popcorn Chicken (1 order), Tuna Tacos (2), Torched Salmon Roll (2), Prawn Tempura Roll (1), Tuna Truffle (2), Scallop Nigiri (2), Eel Nigiri (1), and the Coconut Gelato (1). For drinks we got the Spicy Margarita and the Nin Jin 3.0 - we‚Äôre big tequila fans. When I tell you our jaw DROPPED at the first thing we ate - the tuna tacos - I am not exaggerating. We‚Äôre a bit of sushi snobs, so we are always let down by at least one thing we order, but not here. Everything was phenomenal - so much so that I‚Äôm writing this review while waiting for the Gelato. The flavor, the texture, the portion sizes - everything. Don‚Äôt even think about it twice, make the reservation.

Authors note: I have now tasted the coconut gelato and even completely stuffed full, my stomach is loving me for eating this.","Where to begin. Seriously the best meal of our trip to date. The food was exceptionally fresh and so flavoursome. We had the fish of the day sashimi and it was so delicious. We loved everything and were surprised by how incredible the cucumber salad was! A true testament to how they have perfected highlighting their fresh ingredients. The atmosphere was also lovely and vibey! The live music was great and the mood lighting was spot on!  Finally, the staff were so friendly and attentive, they really made our night special. The only problem we faced was trying to find a time to come back before the end of our trip!","We were so impressed by this place, from amazing decor and vibes to delicious and fresh food! And don‚Äôt forget the drinks, so good! One of the best restaurants we tried in Bali! I loved every detail on the presentation of the food and the simple touches like providing mosquitoes repellent.

If you‚Äôre looking for 5* accommodation then this isn‚Äôt for you. I stay in luxury hotels around the world and this one charmed me.

The location is incredible and the views from the breakfast restaurant are amazing. We stayed 7 nights and only went to breakfast once but that‚Äôs personal preference.

The room was clean and basic with an ocean view water provided daily and room cleaned to a good standard.

The first day the shower wouldn‚Äôt drain, I contacted reception and this was sorted immediately unlike with bigger brands I stay who take ages.

Every member of staff is lovely and helpful and the location alone is worth staying at.

No issues with getting grab etc despite a toll booth at that top, residents are exempt.

Pool is shared with single Finn and was a bit filthy but it‚Äôs currently being re done so that will improve.

All your normal Bali bugs, lizards and centipedes.

In a nutshell shell it was a nice stay albeit not what I‚Äôm used to but I enjoyed it and would stay again.","Booked afternoon tea set with Blue Point. Surprisedly spending 545k Rupian per person you will only get a slice of cake (without a choice) and a cup of hot or cold standard beverage. The swimming pool next to the glass house is still under maintenance for such a long period of time already and the glass house is shut without any access. We asked for waters and were told no cup of waters available but they can do bottle of water for 40k‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs really unbelievable the service they are treating you over there and definitely not recommending anybody go. However, been to The Edge 2 days ago with a little bit extra money, you will get a totally different experience, wonderful view, excellent service and lovely photos.","Pros:
- Very friendly and helpful staff
- free 15 minute foot massage
- fantastic views
- great location

Cons:
- rooms and facilities are EXTREMELY outdated and run down, everything is old, looks dirty and is falling apart (we had to change rooms twice from the twin rooms and eventually we were upgraded to a junior suite)
- huge gaps under doors so rooms are infested with bugs
- breakfast is a limited selection
- local taxi drivers don‚Äôt allow grab taxis to come down to the hotel but the local drivers charge significantly more than the grab drivers - we had to push our luggage all the way back up the massive hill to get our taxi to the airport
- infinity pool under construction until June 24

I‚Äôm sure this resort was once beautiful but it needs some serious updating. It‚Äôs literally mouldy and falling apart. We did try to leave the resort but there was no other accommodation available. Even the junior suite was bug infested. I do not recommend staying here at all.","Staying at Blue Point Resort in Uluwatu was overall a pleasant experience. The location is stunning, and the staff were attentive to our needs. However, there were a few hiccups during our stay. Upon entering our room, we noticed that the pillows were dirty, but the staff promptly replaced them upon our request. Additionally, I experienced some discomfort after consuming breakfast, possibly due to the mushrooms, salad dressings, or sausages. Unfortunately, the Infinity Pool was also closed for renovation during our visit. Nevertheless, considering the price and performance, Blue Point Resort is still a good choice for accommodation in the area.","This has been a terrible and unexpected huge deception in our last part of our trip to Bali. Even though the location is beautiful on the cliff, we had the information from our agency that this would be a relaxing experience. We booked this in November.
Nothing more than that.
Just when we arrived, there was a loud crowd in the swimming pool for the sunset of people from outside... but we didn't have a spot to see it being hotel guests.
The rooms were dirty. We paid for superior double beds, and they wanted to give us a dark twin bed with no views, only with a net giving to dirty area covered by bamboo. All dirty and broken, the towels were dirty, walls for painting.
Then they offered us another room super dumb,  even the lamp was covered in mould,  you could not even breathe, misted mirror horrible smell.
Finally, they gave us a normal nicer room on the garden, but with dirty towels again, the furniture was covered in dust, and the lamp on de bedside was burnt and broken! When we complained,  there's no manager,  only the sales manager who said we would be given a free meal with one drink. It turned out to be that a meal is just a starter for one person...and the lamp wouldn't be changed in the 4 days here.
We ordered laundry, and my dress came back still dirty.
Food is mediocre and variety very poor. Don't come here if you have any food allergy or intolerance.  The stuff doesn't have a clue, very doubtful health and safety food, and there's zero options in the breakfast and dinner for fluten/dairy intolerance. I just could have eggs,  lettuce, and fruit. Also, it is only halal food.
The streets around here are hard to walk, no lights, and a lot of traffic.  Beaches are beautiful but hard to arrive with hundreds of stairs.
Only recommended for partying and eating rubbish."

It is touristy and pricey, but the food was delicious and beautifully plated. Their burrata and hummus sourdough toasts were devious.

Our decision to finally visit couldn't have been more rewarding. From the moment we stepped in, they delivered beyond expectations. Craving steak, we noticed their charcoal chicken alongside mashed potatoes and broccoli, and it was a revelation! The burrata, accompanied by flavorful tomatoes, was simply divine. And let's not forget the perfectly crafted bread, neither too crunchy nor too soft, paired flawlessly with salted butter. I wholeheartedly rate this place a 9 out of 10; it exceeded all expectations. The ambiance exudes a captivating moodiness, and despite its allure, seating was promptly available. The staff, incredibly friendly and attentive, added to the overall charm. I'm already planning my return, eager to introduce my friends to this remarkable establishment. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try; you won't regret it!","Great place, delicious mouthwatering food, sourdough bread and nice drinks menu.
One thing I didn‚Äôt like was that one of the appetizers - carrot with hummus - was drowning in oil. As I ordered it as one of two small dishes as my healthy dinner and not to soak up everything with bread it wasn‚Äôt exactly what I was looking for, but otherwise all dishes were amazing and I loved the place.","Great place for lunch/breakfast

Really kind and attentive staff, delicious food and really good coffee!!

The aesthetic is also very clean and nice!

Would recommend the Brie, bacon and cranberry sandwich! Actually tasted like decent Brie too. The pancakes were also lovely","ULU Artisan - the best up and coming restaurant in Uluwatu at the moment I‚Äôd say! I‚Äôve had breakfast, lunch and dinner here. The breakfasts are absolutely brilliant, I daresay Michelin star quality(?!) - the chefs are able to make meticulously chosen flavour pairings for dishes that are relatively complex for the first meal of the day. I‚Äôm always impressed. Lunch is simple - choose a rotisserie chicken and some delicious sides. Dinner is just as great, we loved the crispy pork belly (worked very well with the crisp apple) and Lion‚Äôs mane steak frites! We also had the French toast for dessert - delicious. We‚Äôve only had one evening meal here, but it won‚Äôt be our last!! We‚Äôll be back very soon!"

Great view comes with great lengths of effort. Exiting main road and entering the road going down to the cottage is somewhat tricky for car driving but still manageable.

Car parking is available for several spaces

And right from the front office desk you will be immediately greeting with beautiful cliff view like no others!

Staying there you will not get the modern ambiance like recently build resort nearby.

Somehow the manage to maintain the property in good condition

Use their wifi since you will hardly getting normal operator signal (which is normal considering where you are at the moment)","A small, peaceful oasis in Uluwatu with a few things to keep in mind. First off the staff are kind, friendly, and very accommodating. They took care of us at the restaurant and throughout the day, and organized transportation with a driver that we used throughout our trip. The location is also great, as the pool overlooks a beautiful cliffside and ocean view.

The restaurant is totally good and offers a large daily breakfast and plenty of options for snacks and other meals. The pool is so relaxing but has seen better days - some loose stones require care when walking around or climbing in/out. Our room, the deluxe double number 29, was similar. Everything we needed to be comfortable, but not the cleanest place around and pretty dark inside. The other rooms, all painted white, could have been cleaner and brighter than ours. Two bottles of free water per day.

I would recommend Uluwatu Cottages to anyone looking for a laid-back place to relax in the sun. The staff are wonderful, and the chill vibe makes up for some of the hotel‚Äôs lack of polish.It‚Äôs also a short walk from numerous beaches and restaurants via a quiet backroad.

Bonus points to Kaka, the restaurant manager, and his team for accommodating us as vegans!","I stayed here with my wife for a romantic stay and it outdid our expectations. All the cottages are located around the pool and restaurant with a spacious feel. There is good distance between rooms and feel very private. The view above the cliff is stunning.

The breakfast included is a great individual serving of eggs/toast with accompaniments plus a tropical pancake. The food was great and good drink options also.

The cottages are located right where we wanted to be near the surf of uluwatu and many restaurants. Handy to have a bike to get around though, which we rented from the resort hassle free.","Location is beautiful and close by some good restaurants, yoga place,shops and a beach. Also the service and breakfast are good but not exceptional. The pool has some lose stones and sharp edges at some places so mind your steps. It seems overal the hotel needs some update. It‚Äôs very old fashioned too. Also the road to the hotel is not good. We used a taxi always."

With that said, I really enjoyed the lunch and watching the sunset here, it's just the pasta was a bit overcooked in the vegetarian lasagna and the taste was a bit too smoked for me. It's not a big deal, but Italians usually care about details like that. The bombolone was good, but compared to Plant Bistro, it's only the second best in Bali.

They have some of the best cocktails in uluwatu and a great happy hour list. We really loved their pizzas, you can tell they use quality ingredients.
Every server there was friendly and smiling all the time! Jordi recognised us from the last time we were there and gave us a very welcoming smile. Also Suryani gave us great service.

It's tucked away down some stairs on the cliff face.The atmosphere and vibes were great. Drinks were good.  We ordered a margarita pizza,  it was good, pizza base was delicious.

The staff were super helpful and kind, I think it made a huge difference when a couple of small things went wrong (we had issues with hot water and our shower) - and they happily let us change rooms the next day.

Only feedback we would have is to provide darker block out curtains as the morning light would wake us up quite early everyday.

The rooms are beautiful, pool is pretty too. Honestly, if you‚Äôre staying here during weekdays you‚Äôll have the best time here. The Hotel is also located very central, close by to everything.

I gave this hotel a one star for location because it is close by to the nightclubs Tabu (approx. 200m) and Ulu Cliffhouse (700 m). On Friday and Saturday they throw massive parties there and the supplied earplugs won‚Äôt help to kill the bass.Parties go on till the early morning (4am), the earlier in the morning the more bass will be added.(More BPMs).
