An absolutely beautiful part of Bali.  The resort is stunning.  Our room was right on the beach and the pool.  It was clean, tidy and the outdoor bathroom was a highlight.  The staff were fantastic.  Daily activities were organised for us,  and the meals were fantastic.   We also loved Snobby the pug dog.  We really hope we can come back one day.  Thank you to Esther and the wonderful team that took care of us.","Perfect place to escape the hustle and mayhem of the south. Our room was really clean, bed was super comfy as well. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get to meet the owners as they were away but we were graciously welcomed by Esther who went out of her way to get my girlfriend medication and had it back at our doorstep within 10 minutes of our request! The rest of the team and chefs were very hospitable and prepared us a lovely seafood dinner right on our patio on our last night here. Highly recommended!","Very nice resort, pool and staff. The beach is not really a swimming beach. Bring surf shoes as the rocks have sharp shells.
The real downside is the distance to Lovina. They offer a shuttle for 200k round trip or you can rent a scooter for 150k. Traffic in Lovina is not usually too bad. Takes 15min to get into town.","This is a piece of paradise! We loved our stay here so much. Our villa was the one right by the beach and pool and absolutely gorgeous, both the bedroom and open bathroom.

The owner Paul was so sweet to us, took us to the city by car one evening and even helped me out with some medicine when I got sick. We love his pug and we made friends with a cute, pregnant feral kitty.

We have to say the photos don't do this place justice, it really is wonderful!

The only thing we would change was a bit more variety at the hotel restaurant when it comes to vegetarian/vegan meals ‚ù§Ô∏è","Nothing bad could get said about Inbalance except that we didn't stay long enough. The staff were fantastic especially Aster and Ayu. The restaurant is open for all meals and we're delicious. You can't get closer to the beach if you tried. The pool is perfect. The beds comfy. And it's only 5 mins from several little tokos, warungs and mini marts. Hope my husband keeps his promise to stay a week in June ‚ù§Ô∏è"

The 'fairy' sight at night time by the pool/beach and garden is accompanied by the soothing sound of the waves nearby increase the romantic quality of this villa. 2 large kitchens with gaz stoves and fridgs.

Recommend the package of services that includes a team of three local cooks, a gardener/security person providing tasty breakfast and dinner. Local market is opened in the morning for the adventurous (call and rent a motor bike if prefer), otherwise a western like grocery store (Pepito) is 15 minutes distance on bike. Not much night life around here but excellent location for rest and relaxation (isolated enough, but not too far from basic need and services).","I love how quite this villa, with only the sound of the waves.

The two bungalows are really only a single bedroom, as one of the  bungalows doesn't even have a dividing door and the rooms are very small. Also the bathroom is connected to one bedroom so the other bedroom occupant has to go into someone else's bedroom to go to the toilet. For the price, this is not a villa I'd book again.

Lovina is a less visited part of Bali but this really adds to the charm - it‚Äôs very relaxing and peaceful. Segara Murti was a beautiful place to base yourself. Lovina is so underrated within Bali, the attractions and tours we visited were all fantastic (and generally quiet).

We stayed for 10 days and during our stay we spent most of the time in the villa since we didn't need to cook anything or buy anything, it was handled by the staff. Speaking about the staff, they ware so kind and helpful. The 2 girls that cooked every meal for us and cleaned the whole house was so good and meticulous. They cooked fantastic balinese food (since that was what we wanted), but they were also able to cook european food. The gardeners came every morning and fixed the sun beds, the outdoor dining area and the whole garden. When we woke up everything was in order and we could enjoy a nice breakfast with egg, bacon, pancakes, bread, fresh fruit, freshly squeezed juice and coffee (we brought our own nespresso capsules). When we wanted to go on some kind of trip the staff called a cab. It took 30 minutes at the most and costed almost nothing. When we went on the dolphin trip, a small boot picked us up just outside the villa- one of many benefits of living right by the sea.
I highly recommend you to visit the villa if your looking for a magical, calm vacation. Best regards family dahlberg","Perfect place for perfect holidays.
