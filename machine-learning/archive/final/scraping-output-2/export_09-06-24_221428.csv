The hotel grounds are immaculate and the spa is beautiful. It also has two thermal pools the restaurant overlooks the lake. Plenty of activities available. It's a little bit away from any other amenities or life would be a perfect honeymoon location. Photo is the view from my ground floor outside terrace,"Beautiful Hotel in a very quiet area!
I love the big resort and the hot spring. You can do very nice snorkeling trips or try some stand up paddling. Also the build a new yoga spot. The food in the evening is very good - the tuna steak is delicious.

The only note: fresh smoothies for all customers would significantly improve the breakfast buffet.","Beautiful location. Nice restaurant overlooking the mangroves. Only four star because of mice and rat droppings found in the room (not a big problem, it's very in the wilderness so these things happen). Negatives were that the hotel closed a major path off to our room for nearly our entire stay and gave no reason why (I think maybe a yoga treat was staying and they prioritised their privacy) and the jogging track was closed.","You need to stay at least 3-4 days to fully enjoy this place. When I first landed in Bali I stayed in South Bali where it was super touristy and really full of people. Then I found this gem up in the North West.

I love the way they do things here. Love the traditional style of the ancient Balinese. Really adds to the feel. Wonderful setting with Authentic hot springs. Staff are friendly and responsive. Food is great. Nature is great. Many wildlife in the resort. Would be exceptionally good for kids. They have tour packages and you can get customized tours to the one of your liking. I‚Äôm going to do the wildlife tour today and am super excited","I was so pleasantly surprised by the resort. It was booked for me as part of a tour so I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but the rooms and garden were immaculate, the staff so helpful, and the food delicious and reasonable. Sri at the dive centre was an awesome dive leader for Menjangan Island and I will absolutely be coming back soon."

Perfect for relaxing and enjoying the day. Also suitable for families. I have been to this place several times and always enjoy coming back.üôè,"There were only 4 locals and when they left I had the pool for myself.

There are showers, toilets, lockers (5K) and a restaurant and everything is clean.
The water is very hot so you can't stay too long in the water.

The price is much more than before. Locals pay 15K and foreigners 45K.","The water temperature are slightly higher than other hotspring in Bali. But after a few minutes you'll get used to it. There's a restaurant here, with reasonable price.","It was pretty hot in the afternoon, even in the shower, so better to come here early in the morning. It was crowded during public holiday. And don't leave your stuff coz the monkeys can pick it up.","Its a must visit place if you are in west Bali. Better to come on weekday. Less people. The ticket for local is IDR10,000 and IDR20,000 for foreigner. They only have 2 pools but the water is pretty hot so recommend to visit this place early morning or late afternoon. The place itself is clean. Have shower, toilet, locker as well in the area. According to local this place is the hottest hot spring in Bali. Oh btw be careful with your belongings coz we saw few monkeys üôâ when we were there :)"

The restaurant offers local and international food. Excellent!
You can arrange all the activities you like, form hiking to diving.
I highly raccomandate this resort, it‚Äôs a diamond for relax and tranquility!
Thanks for all! We will be back!","We had the chance to stop at NAYA GAWANA hotel during our honeymoon and we had a great stay. The service from the team, the room and the food were amazing, they have a very good chef. If we have the chance to come back, we will book some diving session as well !

Thanks again for everything","We spent 2 nights in a Lumbung suite, just an amazing experience !
Pool area is great too and service is very nice.
Good starting point to go snorkeling too.
Definitely recommend it.","Room : OK, no TV
Pool üëç nice view
staffs are friendly
Price for food was a bit expensive compared to some hotel in menjangan / pemuteran area - breakfast was charged 182K only got fruit, 1 kind of indonesian food and juice","We stayed here about 7 years ago and it cost us a squillion for the one night.
Now there are specials and now worth it.
We had a lovely standard cottage. It had its own courtyard and was  very private.
Heaps of accessories in the open air bathroom. Some fresh fruit in our room.
While we had dinner our bed was turned down and our bathroom tided.
The dining room is lovely. The meals are reasonably priced and generous. And the waiting staff are well trained.
There is a small hot spring pool below the huge main pool. A reason for my return was this pool.  So relaxing and I am sure it must be good for you.
Our breakfast was very generous.
We enjoyed our stay and will return soon as it is only 60km from our villa."

He is extremely patient, friendly and professional. A credit to the hotel. Thank you so much. Ann Room 232","Amazing beach front restaurant on the water.  You arrive and are greeted with excellent service and have the most amazing view of water and volcanos. Then comes the food. Everything we ordered during our 7-day trip was awesome.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner were a delight.  We especially enjoyed sunset dinner and an extensive dinner menu.  From traditional Balinese menu to seafood menu to Italian menu. Everything is amazing and delicious.  If you are celebrating a special occasion, Sunset Beach restaurant is the place to go.","At first it may seem an isolated location, but the resort has everything you could possibly want. Breakfast definitely has everything you could desire. We stayed 14 days and didn‚Äôt eat the same dinner twice. Great variety, tasty and affordable. The lovely chef even offered us our choice of ‚Äúnon-menu‚Äù items.
Service is excellent, with most staff greeting us by name. So many smiles, it feels like staff members are all one big family.
The view is amazing across the water to the distant volcano - dramatic at breakfast time and romantic in the evenings.","I've had the privilege to have eaten the most amazing food all over the world but the tuna steak I enjoyed this evening is by far the most succulent and flavoursome tuna I have ever tasted.

My thanks to an excellent team here for just the right amount of attentiveness - not too much, not too little and willingness to go the extra mile.

I thoroughly recommend this delightful restaurant.","Went here for drinks and dinner with friends. Beeeautiful place. The view of the mangroves and the ocean is just amazing. The food is delicious and the service super nice, with a big smile. Puja is a very friendly guy, making your stay as pleasant as possible. Thank you for the nice evening"

Room is very comfy and clean.
Outdoor bathroom is the highlight.
Staff are very helpful: arranging our snorkelling trip, and picking me up from white sand beach with scooter.

Cons:
Communication is a bit chaotic, especially when we were there we need to move to different rooms, but some confusions between the manager, the staff and us happened.
Breakfast was really basic, no fruits. Coffee does not taste.
Pool was only being cleaned after I asked for the 3rd time.

The grounds were beautifully maintained with a very relaxed feel, a lot of comfortable seating around a very lovely pool.

The prize is very good for an Hotel in Bali and the houses are very spacious. The owner and the stuff are very helpful and welcoming, the Pool area is just beautiful.","The place is under new management and they are AWESOME. Ketut (aka Gato) was on top of everything even before we arrived.
The place is great in so many levels but the staff is the first one.
Also, the food was extra yummy. Best nasi goreng I have ever eaten, with a touch of sambal matah and a very different recipe. Must try!",Relaxed atmosphere. Friendly staff. Sumptuous meals. Great views from nearby. Good base for exploring

Food and coffee was excellently priced. Coffee was good but the food definitely leaves something to be desired and is pretty bland. This place definitely has potential. A couple guests was in the pool area. There is an associated villas in the back.,The service was great. The food was great. I absolutely loved the Mahi-mahi. No complaints about any of the food. I loved the vibe and definitely want to come back.,"Food was very average for the price, nowever the staff were friendly enough. Honestly I wouldn't have even left a review for this place but at paying the bill we were charged the 21% tax which I was prepared for as it stated this on the menu but then slugged another 2% for paying with card thats 23% in total! What's next? 21% is a healthy money grab I feel they should incorporate the card fee into it.. like most other businesses that often charge zero tax to start with.","Ordered 3dishes: grilled marlin, grilled chicken and new york burger. Sorry to say but none is good. Fish meat is old and dry, really really dry. The same goes with the chicken. Seems like its been reheated many times. There is no juice at all left in the fish nor chicken. As for burger, there are many ""bombs"" in the burger patty. There are many small bones which some are sharp that yiu dont want it get stuck in your throat.
Just the service is ok as waitress are friendly.","I think this is restaurant with the the best service in Bali that i tried. When i told my partner that i got bitten by mosquito, the girl gave me anti mosquito lotion without i ask. And when i put my bag on the floor as our table only for 2, she took the chair for my bag, again, without i ask. They are so kind and nice. The grilled fish is delicious and fresh. Love it."
