Furthermore, I got no response when we asked for a refund for the lower floor room, as my mum couldn‚Äôt stay in there (bad for her health) and had to leave to another hotel. It is quite far from the main strip, down a poorly lit dirt road - wouldn‚Äôt recommend walking alone.","This place has real potential but has been let go a bit.
Nobody there to check us in on arrival and didn‚Äôt have our booking, they sorted this for us.
First thing we noticed was the pool was filthy, like really filthy. We asked when it was going to be cleaned and were told today or tomorrow. Pool was not cleaned in our 3 night stay.
Rooms clearly used to be very nice but have been neglected. Marks on walls and mattress. Plumbing in bathroom absolutely stinks.","I think it's really worth the price. Yes it is old building, but it's not bad for the price",Lovely little guesthouse tucked away in a quiet part of Nusa Lembognan. The owners are a lovely family and rooms are very clean. I think it has been the best value for money place we have stayed in Indonesia. The only downside was the WiFi was a bit slow but other than that no complaints!,"We came for 2 nights and ended up staying so much longer! The room is very spacious and air con works very well! Owner and her family is very lovely , can rent moterbike on site!"

My husband ate two plates, me one. We were there on a Sunday at 2:30 pm and they still had Babi guling available. We had heard sometimes they run out by noon. We got lucky!  They told us to come back again tomorrow and they would be serving. We recommend!","Probably the only place to cure our crave for local Balinese babi guling dish on the island. The eatery is combined with a warung selling everyday items. Normally the eatery sells Nasi Campur (mixed rice) with pork. They only serve babi guling (roasted pork) on Saturdays or when there is order from local pura and the menu lasts until it finishes, so come before 2 PM Saturday.","Not to spicy, big portion, cheap!","The best babi guling that u ever try, authentic and I hv orders 2x the crackers.

The bungalows are really spacious, have a fan and good air conditioning, and a big bathroom! Great value for money.

A very quiet location, just off the main road. Walkable from where you get dropped off by boat from Bali. I slept really well here, there was no noise at all!

The room was very clean with no issues. There is also a really nice pool with sun-beds üåû

I would definitely return here ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Only complaint would be that on our final night the whole room got smoked out by some kind of bonfire with plastics. Not sure if this was the accommodation or a local place but it was highly uncomfortable in the middle of the night!","It aint hard to find this place and it‚Äôs located nearby the main road. We booked a room via Traveloka like 5 days before our arrival but apparently our booking wasn‚Äôt listed, idk why. Luckily they still had ONE LAST room available although we got a twin bed while we expected for a queen sized (and they didn‚Äôt compensate us for that). So it‚Äôs important for you to make a call before to make sure. However, I can say the atmosphere was very good and relaxing though we got a little trouble in our room that the AC was leaking. But the rest was all fine. And oh! They can connect you to a trip organizer which I found offering the best deal for snorkeling trip among othersüëçüèº",Great accommodation. Great staff. Did the snorkelling tour was incredible and very cheap,"Stayed here for about 2 weeks and found it hard to leave. Beautiful little bungalows around a nice pool and hosted by an incredibly kind couple. They made this place feel like home to us and were able to move thing around each time we asked to extend our stay. Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough, thank you guys and hopefully we will be back again some day!","Highly recommended! The villa is owned by a lovely couple, we got our Visa card swallowed at the ATM machine when we arrived at the island, the owner was so understanding to help us sort things own even it was so troublesome for them. Glad that we stayed with them! ‚ù§Ô∏èHope we could give something back for them to let anyone considering staying at there place, they have the transport services also"

Although a little out from the seaside views, we were lucky to have this little oasis to ourselves. Very clean establishment, great hangout spots (including a massive rooftop to practice yoga and chill). The owners are super helpful and accomodating, they can organise awesome surf lessons through Newbro surfing. Would definitely recommend anyone who is on a budget and wanting more bang for their buck.","We had a great time at The Green Groves! The local family and staff running this place are really welcoming and helpful. They are also involved in many activities on the island, so it's easy to get the best help for anything you wish to do. It's a modern place with true Lembongan culture combined. You will need a scooter or bike to get around, but the location is great for us with easy access to Jungutbatu becah for surf and restaurants, the Mangroves for snorkeling and boat tours (and also nice restaurants) and it's also close to Ceningan for even more surf and restaurants. Before, we stayed at one of these locations, and usually we never really got around. So this time we  saw a lot of the island in one go. We also spent a lot of time in the pool and on the roof top watching the sunset and volcano. We really recommend this place if you wish to explore these islands!","+ I stayed in garden grove for a week and it was amazing! Its comfi, clean wifi an AC the food is great there is place to chill also on the rooftop and a swimming pool that is just right to cool from the heat! but the best part are the hosts so nice and caring and helping and the price is very fair!
- i would love to have some fresh water in the shower but thats aperrantly a problem on the hole island and a solution for the flyes just so u can eat in peace","Very good experience there, the owner was really helpful to us finding some good deals for us to enjoy our stay on the island.
The only weak point is the surf lessons : 350 000 roupies to tell you paddle and stand up is way overpriced.","The best hostel in Jungutbatu Lembongan! Lots chill places, free parking, green atmosphere, free wifi, local owner, watching sunrise n sunset up deck, breakfast, ü§ô"
