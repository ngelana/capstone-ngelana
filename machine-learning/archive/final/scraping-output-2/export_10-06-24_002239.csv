I've visited twice and each time I was overwhelmingly impressed by everything this location offers: it's the epitome of Bali, with its openness to the jungle, harmonious gardens, and stylishly designed houses that are tastefully decorated. There's a sense of elegance and great taste in the arrangement, allowing every corner to offer an opportunity to be in nature, for relaxation and meditation. Two of the three houses have panoramic views of the jungle, and the bathrooms overlook the small lakes arranged around the houses, all in perfect harmony with nature. The cleanliness is impeccable, and the staff are incredibly friendly and responsive to any request. The villa is situated in a village with local wood craftsmen, and you can take a walk through the beautifully extending rice terraces right outside. Here, time stands still, allowing you to disconnect and feel the pulse of nature. I highly recommend experiencing this location, whether as a place to stay on your way to visiting nearby sights or simply to relax and disconnect. Among the many places I've visited, this would be my top choice",Excellent villa secluded in a forest. The infinity pool overlooking the forest is fantastic. The best we had in Bali. The rooms are large and clean but you might see a few geckos on the rooftops. Not an issue as they run away seeing humans.,"After six months traveling through Southeast Asia, this is the best hotel experience I've had. Keep in mind you are 45 minutes away from the center of Ubud, so you are coming here for a retreat, and what a great place to do it. Only three villas available in the entire place. I stayed in the largest one and felt like a king for the week I was there. You'll be in a good place to go explore waterfalls and see Balinese life in the nearby town. The staff is also fantastic, thank you Gecko and team.
This was such a good experience that it made me consider moving to Bali.","Great value, located within a nice jungle outlook. Met our purpose to get away from the hustle and bustle. Relaxed and rejuvenated. Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. Breakfasts were just simply nice. We will definitely be back to stay for another enjoyable retreat.","Beautiful villa tucked away, secluded and peaceful. There are only three villas and one single room. Stayed for a few days just to completely switch off and most of the time I was on my own. If you just want to sit, read, relax, swim, then this place is for you - although Ubud and the nearby attractions are an easy taxi journey away. Special mention to the awesome swimming pool and all the staff who were so friendly & helpful. 100% recommended."

The owner, Hainer, treats himself much better than his guests.
We stayed 6 months in 2020.
The administration closed access to the main, professional kitchen (said if was a ""staff room"") and left us only a very small, very basically equipped kitchen.
That small kitchen had a leaking roof, and was constantly wet, every day. I had to reduce the rent by 10%, but still feel we should have left the place.
They didn't repair the roof in the 6 months we stayed there. I contacted the owner, who made it very clear he didn't want to be contacted at all.
Even if the staff did what they could, they didn't manage to clean the house properly, and felt dusty all the time.
The house is beautiful in principle, but is not well maintained, the administration is basically a group of useless slouches, and the owner is perfectly indifferent to the guests' needs. In case you haven't got the idea, I don't recommend this place for all these reasons.",Remote and beautiful.  You have to want serenity and enjoy being in the jungle...because you are out there.  You could spend days walking around the property and discover new things all the time.  It is gorgeous.  Highly recommended.,"Mesmerising place, fine and quiet, surrounded by jungle.","Fantastic, isoleted place, real Bali"
