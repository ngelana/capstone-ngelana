I ate dumplings and pancakes, everything was fresh and delicious. The desserts, coconut candy and Syrok, were also very tasty. the service is pleasant.‚ù§Ô∏è","Table is pretty hard to get as the place is small and popular.

We tried few positions on the menu and food was generally good but there wasn‚Äôt anything special about it
Favourite thing I tried was actually kids mash potatoes and sausages üòÑ

Tiny kids play corner is a big plus as well for families with small children üëç

*I am very sensitive to smells and I did not like the way it smelled inside ( not sure what it actually smelled of but it wasn‚Äôt very pleasant üôà)","The most delicious desserts on Bukit.
We love this place for their delicious desserts, breakfasts. From what we tried, we liked the English breakfast, shakshuka, snickers cake, honey cake , chicken steak, cheesecake, eclairs, the coffee was also good.

But the meringue cake, napoleon we didn't like(üç∞

Met the hostess of the place.
We ordered a dessert from her for our birthday. Everyone liked the cake very much!

From the minuses:

The price tag on the dishes is a bit high, but I think it's because of the lack of competitors.
Also noticed that sometimes the floors are dirty, the bathroom, and the staff, when they work without a hostess as if working worse.

They forget, carry a long time, confuse the order.
I hope the owners will pay attention to thisüôèüèª","Great local place for a tasty snack.
Service is good, cooking is sometimes slow and the place itself is quite basic.
But when I don‚Äôt feel like going to a favourite place this one just works fine."

Internet is good, but better in case when villa close to reception. Staff very nice and friendly. Villas are clean and bright. Not so many space, but if you come to Bali for traveling (not sitting in the villa) - it‚Äôs perfect variant. )",This scammers stole money from the villa from me and my friends,"For this price, nothing gets better than this.

Negative:
- insects gathers around the lights in front of the swimming pool. (It happened in early raining season, better than keep seeing lizard in canggu)
- location around this place are very quiet and it will be difficult if you don't have your own car or scooter.
- Could you provide hair dryer? It Will be very difficult for ladies to dry up their hair. And i don't think its expensive either.

Positive:
- The location are very quiet, the air are very fresh, i can see the stars on the sky. Perfect for people who want to spend quiet time.
- Private pool. Nothing gets better than this. Try to find another place like this at the same price.
- 3 bedroom villa. It's so spacious for big family. The building are new as well. I really like to have my meal in front of the swimming pool.
- Kitchen are fully loaded, other than stove, it comes qith everything you need. Toaster, microwave, water heater.
- The staff here are the champion. They are very responsive to the complain. Very friendly. I complained about the pool and access to the alley.
- Breakfast taste pretty good. I try their omelette, mie and nasi goreng. And it even comes with orange juice and watermelon.

I guess my biggest complain here are only hair dryer"

Kismet provides a safe sanctuary full of kind souls, a beautiful dog and a generous, welcoming and funny host!

If you are looking to stay somewhere where you will feel at home, look no further than Kismet. You will feel at home from the second you step through the door. The rooms are cosy and well-priced, the kitchen is well-stocked and nice to chill in, and there is also a small gym to use. Additionally, there is a cheap warung just next door which serves tasty local food.

Seriously, look no further than Kismet! You will not regret booking your stay here",Kismet became the home that I was missing on Bali. Sarah the host has this magic with her that makes you so so happy. Kismt itself is such a beautiful place. There is a garden and the open kitchen is like the heart of the community. This area is quiet and relaxed. You are so close to the most beautiful beaches and Uluwatu Center is not far away.,"Such a wonderful place to stay. The rooms have nice big desks which are perfect if you need to do a bit of work. The kitchen is the hub and you'll always find the host Sarah or another guest there if you want to chill out and have a chat. Sarah supplies everything you need, medicines, cleaning supplies, toilet supplies and even some instant noodles for a late night feast. It's just a nice place to be and a really friendly vibe. I definitely recommend staying at Kismet and will be back for sure.","When you see travellers returning over and over again to the same hotel, you know it‚Äôs an excellent place to stay. This is a non-pretentious homestead and yet offers everything that you need: nice clean facilities, silence and a friendly chat every time you go to the kitchen area and find another guest, Sarah or Sir William (the most gentle dog in Bukit). The rates are affordable, and everything you need nearby: warungs, laundry, supermarkets and my favourite bakery in Uluwatu, Made. The region gives you old Bali vibes. If you are a solo traveller and/or digital nomad who needs silence and appreciate some company, this is your place!","I recently stayed at Kismet in Bukit, and it honestly felt like a second home. Sarah, our host, was incredibly welcoming and kind. Kismet is a perfect spot for solo travelers, slow travelers, digital nomads, and surfers, and the credit for this goes to Sarah's warm and welcoming nature.

Sarah goes the extra mile to introduce guests to each other, making it easy to connect with fellow travelers from around the world. Even if you're an introvert like me, there's no need to worry ‚Äì you'll definitely make friends at Kismet. You can go surfing, diving, and party together, so you're sure to make lasting friendships here.

Also there's a working desk in the room and the environment is quiet , enabling you to focus on work.

One thing that stands out about Kismet is how Sarah takes care of her guests. She has even set up two surf racks in a shaded corner, keeping them away from the sun and showing she understands what matters to her guests. Moreover, Sarah genuinely cares about your well-being and your experience during your stay and takes the time to get to know each guest personally.

All in all, Kismet feels like a true home away from home. I highly recommend it to solo travelers, slow travelers, digital nomads, and surfers looking for an unforgettable experience."
