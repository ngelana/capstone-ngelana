ChIJyV34uz0a0i0RBeBC0Mn9Ie4,De Klumpu Bali Eco Tradi Stay,-8.4542892,115.39441649999999,"Undisan, Tembuku, Bangli Regency, Bali 80671, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17159275098482597893,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3811-161,hotel,"hotel, resort_hotel, lodging, restaurant, food",4.5,202,,"Very friendly and welcoming staff. Super tasty dinner!

Rooms with good atmosphere and clean.

At night, no traffic or human noise is heard, but there are frogs, cockroaches and dogs howling. We used earplugs. There is no A/C, but only a fan, it gets humid and hot at night and the mosquito net around the bed prevents the fan from reaching through.

The the western breakfast was a little too small for us; fruit and toast with butter or jam and 1 crossaint per person.

If you want to stay in the real Bali, this is the place.","This was a small peak into traditional Balinese culture and we highly recommend. The Eco Stay was beautiful, and peaceful away from the city. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. Be aware that you are in the middle of the rice fields, so there are bugs, geikos, etc. and no AC (thus the eco stay) but it was a great place to unplug. I cannot recommend the cooking class enough! The best food we had our whole time in Bali!","Amazing staff. The staff is the friendliest people you will meet. The room itself is good and comfortable. We even took a cooking class here (they also have many other experiences you can choose from) and the cooking experience was really amazing. We got to cook several dishes and learned so much, they even shown us their veggies garden! The location is far away, so perfect if you want to just relax. Getting a taxi can get a little pricy but the hotel staff did a incredible job to help us and always friendly and smiling. The day we had to leave early they even made us a breakfast box so we wouldnt go hungry.  The resort itself is beautiful as well and from the restaurant you can see luscious green rice paddies. Thank you for having us!","The place is absolutely beautiful, a perfect hide out if you are tired of busy Ubud. It is located in a quiet village and surrounded by tranquil rice fields. The view from the balcony is just priceless. But what really made my stay perfect is very friendly and nice staff. They really make an effort for you to have a good time and every situation was handled in a very professional way. Definitely would stay there again.","This is the last place we stayed at during our Bali travels. I wanted a place away from the hustle and bustle, a glimpse of authentic Bali. This place is perfect for it. Picture yourself in the middle of rice fields, next to a small village. The sounds of frogs and Hindu ceremonies afar at night. Watching mount Agung and rice farmers while having amazing food at the hotel restaurant during the day... It's perfect if you want to sit back and sink in Bali. You won't find a cab or a souvenir shop here, instead, walk around the village and spot the many fruit trees around. Book a cooking class in the traditional Balinese kitchen or a Balinese massage. Just enjoy. This is Bali!"
ChIJgfufYRga0i0R3v5uSrE3glM,Air Terjun Krisik,-8.4573836,115.3876428,"Undisan, Tembuku, Bangli Regency, Bali 80752, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=6017433286717931230,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.6,101,,Featuring little hike and wet walks to get to the falls. Not a crowded place. Worth visiting,"I Think it's not so easy to reach the waterfall, you should really be careful, because this place in in the middle of nowhere, if accident happen then it'll be very very hard to find help. Since you reach the end of the path, there's no body, maybe even you scream, still no one can hear you, so take a caution.....

Go walk following the small sign (Tangkup Waterfall), you should reach the waterfall, it's not so big but beautiful, you only hear the sound of the water and the place so beautiful, so green....breath the fresh air.......you can soak under the waterfall.....

Respect the nature......

Back from the attraction you can have a lunch across the main road, there's a warung selling Balinese food.....",Completely amazing. Spend a few hours there completely alone. Make sure you can take off your shoes and there is a looong walk through the caves If you can deal with waist-high water. Absolutely stunning place!,"Beautiful waterfall, the water is July is not cold ! The path is indicated.
The entry (combined with the krisik waterfall) is 20k/pers",Beautiful and completely empty. Only access by motorbike or hiking. Nice seating and area to relax. Completely Free. No mafia or guards. One of my favorite waterfalls here.
