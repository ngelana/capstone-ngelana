It was one of the best experiences of my life. The house is beautiful, the grounds are pristine and peaceful, and the area around is very safe. It is a great option to see ""Real Bali"" rather than stay in the tourist-bubble in the other areas of the city. Lastly, the host is the best host i have ever had, she helped me with the logistics of getting picked up at the airport, she always checked in on me, she helped me with any questions related to the adventures in the area...etc. I have very fond memories in this place, and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Bali.","I was recommended to this place by a lovely friend, it was a retreat from the city life. But don't worry there's plenty to life around just a a few street and you are on the the main street.
Very close to Bali zoo if you haven't visit.
Reasonable good food restaurants around.
And the most not the least memorial was the the magnificent sunrise, sunset jogging path of lilies farms around. And of course the serene garden of this guesthouse.
The villa has all the amenities you need to operate a monthly living.
And the owner Ibu Tuti is delightful, she's warm welcoming and speaks English fluent.
I still think of this place once in a while.","Beautiful house and owner. The place is very beautiful, green and peaceful. The neighborhood also safe and quiet so it‚Äôs a perfect place to stay for long term. The owner Ibu Tuti also very helpful and kind hearted. Very recommended!","Beautiful place. Absolute gem. I've been here almost 2 months and i love it. Quiet and close to nature, but very convenient close to everywhere (Ubud, Denp, Canggu)","Home away from home! But feels like home and this is home. I would like to thank Bu Tuti for all her help to make us feel so comfortable. The location was great as it was close to all the everything we need. its a perfect choice for a comfortable getaway or stay. I'm very sad that I stay at this place at the end of my journey in bali. Bu Tutiiii we're gonna miss you and absolutely weill be back here if i coming to Bali if its still available. Putih, gemoy.. we love you guysss. I hope you guys always happy and healthy"
