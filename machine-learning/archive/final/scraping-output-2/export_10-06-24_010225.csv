Dear Travel Enthusiasts,

We want to share our positive experience at the Desa Hay Hotel in Bali, which met our expectations for hospitality and comfort. Upon arrival, we were welcomed by a warm and elegant atmosphere. Desa Hay is more than a hotel; it's a retreat where every detail has been thoughtfully considered. The property combines comfortable luxury with the charming essence of Balinese culture. The rooms are designed to offer more than just a place to sleep; they provide a genuine experience with beautiful views and all imaginable amenities.

The service at Desa Hay deserves special mention. The staff goes beyond traditional roles to genuinely care for guests‚Äô well-being. Their attention to detail and warmth stood out to us. Every interaction demonstrated their dedication to making the stay memorable. The culinary delights and relaxing spa offerings contributed to making our stay especially enjoyable.

For anyone considering a stay in Bali, Desa Hay is a great choice. It‚Äôs suitable for both a peaceful break and as a starting point for exploring Balinese culture. The hotel promises not just accommodation, but valuable memories.

Our expectations were met, and Desa Hay proved to be a good choice that offers a blend of luxury, culture, and warmth. We left with grateful hearts and lasting memories. If Bali is your destination, we recommend Desa Hay as your home away from home.

Best regards,
Marin","Wow, just wow! My stay at Desa Hay Bali was nothing short of amazing.
The service was top-notch with a super convenient WhatsApp group for instant communication with all hotel departments - talk about being pampered!
My villa blew me away with its comfy bed, breathtaking views of the garden and pool, and that outdoor bathtub with the flower bath experience was just divine.
Waking up to a jungle-like shower in the spacious bathroom was surreal. The private plunge pool in the lush green garden was my serene escape, perfect for some hammock time with my favorite tunes or a good book.
Starting my day with complimentary yoga sessions felt so rejuvenating, and the floating breakfast? Absolutely fun and delicious, especially the sourdough bread with that heavenly guacamole, poached eggs, and salmon topping.
Dining by the pool in the open-air restaurant was the cherry on top - peaceful, with just the right touch of a gentle breeze and warm lighting.
Desa Hay Bali, you have my heart!","Everything about this place is just perfect. It‚Äôs impossible to find something to criticise. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms are beautiful beyond words with your own private pool and outside bathtub. The breakfast was delicious, the juices tasty and presented in style.
If you want to treat yourself to something amazing close to the airport, Desa Hay is the place to be!"

Great and well-done concept of permaculture, amazing team with great energy and practical knowledge of permaculture that they are not afraid of sharing. :)

I cannot recommend Jiwa Community Garden enough - from the delicious food you will find at the caf√©, to attending their courses (especially the 2-day permaculture course is one of the best decisions I have made) or just ""getting your dose of dirt"" by joining an open gardening session.

If you are in Bali - then you must come here.","Jiwa is a special place, a piece of nature right in the heart of Canggu madness. It's not only a great and inspiring garden, but also a place to learn, share and have fun with amazing humans. From workshops to night music jams, it gives you so many reason to come and hang out there. If you haven't been there yet you should definitely make your way to jiwa community garden and discover this unique project.","It‚Äôs amazing to find such organizations that can practice what they preach, and build a community around strong principles. I went here for a permaculture workshop, and went gone feeling humbled, and so much practical learnings to apply with composting, designing landscape and planting. The whole place has compost toilet, zero waste all around the area, and we were served by the local community there with freshly squeezed jaruk (orange) & pandan roll snack. Our vegan lunch was superb with lots of flavors and so filling! They hold different workshops and are always looking for volunteers to help in their programs. Big bravo to Krisna and the founders for such a beautiful initiative. Wish they continue beyond 5 years!

Tip: they also do composting pick ups within 5KM of the area - 80K IDR per month! :)"

Given its budget-friendly rate, it's understandable that the villa doesn't meet premium standards. It's a bit of a trek to the beach; renting a motorcycle helps, but walking can be a hassle. The reception is often vacant, but they're accessible via WhatsApp. The towels and bathroom essentials could use an upgrade. It's suitable for a short stay, but I wouldn't recommend an extended visit.

The resident dogs add a friendly touch. However, if you're squeamish about frogs, rats, or lizards, this might not be your spot. The sliding doors could use some maintenance, the huts are a bit deprecated and the AC power cant withstand Bali‚Äôs noon heat.

Be prepared: the kitchen could be cleaner, and we faced a two-hour power outage during our stay.

In short, manage your expectations. It's a solid choice for budget-conscious travelers who aren't too fussy about accommodations.","we love this hotel very much.

Good location","Cempaka Homestay was really good. I stayed 1 month there. The rooms are cleaned few times a week without asking anything, which I liked. 2 Towels and soap are provided, and changed when they clean the room. It is not always the case with hometays. There is TV, which can be good for single travellers. There is a pool that I don't care of but people on vacation must like it. Please note that there is a small kitchen, with drinkable water on the back that I haven't seen initially. So you can cook if you want.

I found the room a bit small for long-term stays and for remote workers there is no place for a desk in there.  The fact that there is carpentry in front is a minus for noise disturbance during the day. I was busy working so I didn't mind. Cempaka is an affordable and good place to stay around Pererenan.","Spacious, spotless rooms. Stayed here on 3 occasions and will come back again next year. Lovely quiet location.

The cleanness of beds/towels/bathroom and especially of kitchen is one smelly and disgusting mess. The stuff doesn't speak proper English and is not much friendly.

But for me my evening was absolutely unrelaxed.

After a long time nobody recognizes we would like to order, we walked to the kitchen counter to ask about a waiter.
However, there are no waiters to take the order (we had to write down my order on a piece of paper and bring it to the kitchen). Which took more than one try, because A lot of food is not available. Would be nice to mention before...

It took around 30 minutes to get a can of water, after 45-50 minutes we got the ordered drinks which were supposed to be cocktails.
The taste of the cocktails was not good.
(To finally drink something in this hot and not well airflowed area we ordered coke, which came instantly in cans).
The coke was the best for me this evening.

Again a little bit later we got the food.
Beef burger was OK. We got spicy dip to the French fries instead of the ordered non spicy dip.
My friend likes the fries somehow, but I left mine nearly untouched. Tasted like old fat used to fry.

Finally over an hour later we got the ordered shisha, which sadly was absolutely not tasty.
The hardware is nice. But the taste of the tobacco (melon/mint) was sadly not good.

Important to note is, that all toilets are out of order. Absolutely no go in my opinion.
At least the place to wash hands was working.

But additionally I have to say, that the location was absolutely beautiful.
The dancing itself was very nice. Plenty skilled dancers which saved the evening. Friendly community with a lot of possible connections.
(Which is not directly a plus to the location, just nice guests)

All in all for me it is a huge amount of wasted potential.
This could be the place to go. But in this condition I sadly will not come back.

Please increase the quality of service (at least to justify the 5% service fee), add some fans to the outside seating areas and most important, don't let people wait almost an hour to get drinks....

I will check this location again later if something is happening here but so far I have to say that this evening was one of the worst experiences I had living in bali.

If you came until here reading, thank you very mich for your patience and have a nice day.","Good place, good food, good people. I love this place so much...

Strategic location, clean, easy to park, windy and fresh air, friendly staff, the owners also very kind, very recommended to work and chill out here.

Food also very tasty and affordable, start from IDR 30k, value for money..

Very recommended also if you need to watch the football with the superb large screen, or having dance event next to the ricefield could be the best option...","We went for dinner and it was empty, it was decorated for Halloween, the food is good and tasty, although a little expensive.","The people are nice there but the food sizes are a joke.

I had the Spicy Beef Salad, which is a dish I never fail to order when I see it on the menu and it is one the best versions I've had of it in years.

The Chicken with Garlic and rice was also very tasty, especially when you add some of their excellent chili fish sauce condiment.

My only concern is that their location is a bit too far out to have enough customers to support the concept and price point. In the middle of Canggu, they'd be a hit. Out here, I don't know. But I wish them the best of luck.",Enjoyed the environment ordered Thai iced tea and mango sticky rice so can't speak for the savory dishes. But the two dished I got were solid.

There‚Äôs a fully equipped kitchen that all the guests share, there‚Äôs Unlimited coffee, tea, a blender, a toaster, a microwave, a big stove, and all kind of kitchen tools,a very complete kitchen!  super useful for people that like to cook

You‚Äôll also meet great people, there were many digital nomads staying short and long terms. Very suited if you travel alone and you want to meet like minded people.

The room is brand new, with a SUPER confy bed, brand new bathroom. The AC works very well, an outdoor area with with 2 tables.

There‚Äôs absolutely nothing I would change to Green Bali. It‚Äôs great value for money!

There is a kitchen you can cook at but it could be cleaner. The free water tastes off/bad. There is construction on both sides of the building which goes on until 22:00 sometimes and can start at 7:00. Walls are thin and the glass doors rattle when closing.

The price is fair. Highly recommended if you're craving for authentic Italian food!","I‚Äôve been here just to buy wine usually (great selection and price) but recently I came to try the food too and it‚Äôs delicious. I ordered a seafood soup. It was very tasty and a very generous portion of claims m, mussels, squid, prawns and 1 crab. Along with a glass of good white wine, it was just perfect."
