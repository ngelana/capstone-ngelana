Thereâ€™s no receptionist, only maid. This place is more like airbnb or else. And the way to this place is so bad. I will not recommend this villa and i choose to pay cancellation fee rather live at this villa!","Great place. Getting there is strenuous though. But, once you get there, it's like heaven. With the paddy fields, the helpful staff and the swimming pool. Oh. And it has running hot water in the shower.","5 star for the Villa... One start less for the reachability... Excellent, if you are looking for a quiet green place away from the crowded areas...","Wery beautifully place and service.  Clean and fresh rooms and pool.  For sure, I will come back.  THANK YOU.",Quiet place in the middle of the rice fields. Love to stay few weeks in this accomodation.
