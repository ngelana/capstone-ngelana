ChIJFc805_YG0i0RAuLuRAfPAhs,GumiBali Villa,-8.418452,115.5988282,"Peladung, Jl. Subak Buug, Padang Kerta, Kec. Abang, Kabupaten Karangasem, Bali 80852, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=1946345619105702402,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-4658-618,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.7,33,,"nice host and staff, nice view. But the announcement indicated the presence of a kitchen, but in fact there is none, we were offered to use the kitchen in the house of local residents, which is located 200 meters from the villa. The villa has a bathroom, but it is impossible to use it, hot water is only enough to fill 1/10 of the bath, there is not even a kettle in the villa to pour hot water into it. for $540 a week there is not even free water, the air conditioner is not powerful enough to cool the room, there is no TV. The amenities are simply not enough for the money that the owner is asking for, this is not a tourist place, for which such a price is simply incomprehensible. I have something to compare, before that we were in amed, in puri virata, this is a tourist place, and for the same money we had a restaurant, a TV, a beautiful view, the ocean right next to the villa, good air conditioning, the bathroom you can use. good own kitchen, a shop nearby, none of this except for a beautiful view is not in gumi bali. The price is just too high","Staying at GumiBali Villa was something very different, but great! You are in the middle of rice fields and it has its magic. At first, we were really surprised by the location(you literally have to walk between rice fields to get to the villa). Also the owner is really nice and kind, we had a lovely chat with him everytime we met him. They also offer really good and traditional breakfasts and dinners, we can definitely recommend!","Itâ€™s a really great place if you you are looking for peace and nature. The villa is surounded by rice fields. The owners are the best. You can have dinner with them or without. You take cooking class with them.  You can get meet their culture.
I really recommend this place if you want to get more of balinese life.
Thank you so much and I am looking forward to see you again!
Ahoj!","This is the best and very unique Villa in the world. An isolated Villa , but the views and surrounding areas are very incredible. You can see Mount agung from your room or the Deck. Very good service from all the staffs. Very good breakfast and dinner. They prepare very well,what do you want to eat. Will come back again to this Villa,if explore this area. Please contact them directly, if you want to stay on this very beautiful place.","GumiBali 'Universe Bali' is alive with a soothing energetic quality to enrich anyone that visits. Nestled in the ricefields, Kadek Susila has provided very comfortable accommodation with a top floor terrace that provides an opportunity to experience the universe. Beautiful hostess Ninyoman Wini provided authentic Balinese meal and Bali coffee."
