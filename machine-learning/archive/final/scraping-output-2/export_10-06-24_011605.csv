In-house amenities are decent too.
We saw many surfers running to/from nearby beaches. Though that wasn't our interest.
We booked a two bedroom suite. In one bathroom the hand shower wasn't throwing a uniform stream. In the other, washbasin filter was missing. In the kitchen, the kettle won't connect to any power outlet - so we moved it next to the TV.
One day their restaurant ran out of yoghurt needed for smoothies.
Though they have some partnership with a nearby restaurant, they don't encourage asking for cutlery. Also, they treat a two bedroom suite same as a 2 person room for enforcing restrictions. We could not convince the staff to allow four cutlery sets as we were 4 people in a two bedroom suite.
Ending on a positive: breakast spread & service was pretty good.
A few times I booked Grab taxi, it was immediately available in the hotel's parking.","It's really hard to rate this hotel. The environment in the public areas is indeed good, the breakfast is also good, and although half of the service staff are unprofessional and unenthusiastic, at least half of them are good.
However, the room was very humid, very humid! Please pray that it is best not to be assigned to the first floor below. I changed to a room on a high floor where I can get more sun. The quilt was still very damp and my skin was very uncomfortable and always itchy. The hygiene of the floors and table tops is worrisome.","Room here is a major let down. Poorly maintained, bedsheets aren‚Äôt great, electric sockets not working, does not feel like a 5 star hotel especially for bali standard. At night theres loud noise from other drunk guests, goes to show you the kind of guests profile and lack of security. Felt more like a budget hotel than a 5 star. Wish I saved my booking elsewhere","The hotel provides a delightful experience with a touch of European charm in beautiful Bali. The family room is generously spacious, and the amenities, including the spa and shops, are well-maintained, adding to the positive vibe. While there's a slight concern about the main pool's depth, the nearby beach, roomy pool area, and skilled therapists at the massage salon make up for it. Overall, it's a highly recommended spot with just a few minor things to keep in mind. Enjoy your stay!","Le Grande Hotel Bali offers a luxurious retreat in Uluwatu, epitomizing elegance and comfort. The spacious rooms feature modern amenities, providing a serene haven with scenic views. The attentive staff ensures a seamless experience, catering to guests' every need. The hotel's lush surroundings, including a stunning pool area, create a tranquil ambiance for relaxation. Culinary delights await at their restaurants, offering a diverse range of flavors. With its strategic location and impeccable service, Le Grande Hotel Bali stands as a sophisticated choice for those seeking a memorable stay, blending opulence with the natural beauty of Uluwatu."

It‚Äôs a wonderful place once you get a good room. I would suggest a garden view one with a balcony. The service has been so helpful and accommodating to our request. They clean the room daily and ensure to meet all your requests. Such a gem spot from within all the other hotels in the area.,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Swiss Belresort Pecatu, and it was an experience I will never forget. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warm smiles and exceptional service. The staff went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable ü§ç

The resort itself is a paradise. The ambience is stunning, with beautifully landscaped gardens, And breathtaking views. Every detail has been meticulously designed to create a serene and relaxing atmosphere ‚òòÔ∏è

Am sure gonna back here very soon üòç","this hotel was nothing like the photos, it is run down and old and does not look like a ""4 star hotel"".

There was a lot of issues with the room we stayed in ( room 2223)
The walls were dirty and the mini-bar completely empty and not cold enough to keep any drinks in there, no tea or coffee was provided either.
There was also no conditioner in the shower and wasn't refilled during the 4 nights that we stayed there whilst the others were full.
The bathroom door is also the wardrobe space door that has a light permanently on, so if you wanted the bathroom door shut you would have to deal with the light on the whole night.  The towels were old and fraying and gret instead of fresh fluffy white.

the Facilities are next to gone, the gym was filthy with only 3 machines, one of them was out of order.

The pool area was beautiful however not possible to stay there for hours as there are only 3 chairs that provide shade which were taken pretty quickly in the morning.

Room service was an uncomfortable experience as they do not charge on tab, our drinks were brought up to our room and the staff asked us to pay for it immediately, something i was not expecting at a 4 star hotel.

The buffet breakfast was horrendous, stale cereal very small selection of hot food that was the same each day.

The location is not walking distance to any shops, be prepared to be scooting around, i would recommend hiring a scooter whilst you stay at this hotel.

Don't be fooled by the 5 star reviews on this platform like i did, they are most likely fake to push down the bad reviews.

I was honestly so disappointed and wanted to leave the moment we got there and the only thing that stopped me from leaving was knowing i would not be refunded, i felt so duped and did not enjoy my stay at all.","Absolutely loved our stay in Swiss-Belresort. The rooms are clean and service was great. We stayed in the executive suite and it was very spacious. Bathroom was really nice and showers always hot. Bed super comfortable. Our room service was great and rooms cleaned everyday. Only downside is there is no actual door to the bathroom so if you want privacy the other person has to close the door to the living room space. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal for us just kind of weird design. The morning breakfast buffet had a lot of options and we enjoyed it. Pool was really nice to lounge at. My boyfriend booked a massage for us and it was an AMAZING massage, definitely worth it. Food at the restaurant was decent and not expensive. Laundry was expensive here so I would do it elsewhere. Location is kind of in the middle of this golf course but it‚Äôs a 10-15 minute ride to restaurants or beaches. Overall we loved our stay at this hotel and would come back!","We stayed four nights in this hotel and were happy with our stay. The room was nice and housekeeping of the room very good. Fresh towels every day.

I think they are still updating the hotel. And the pool including the sunbed mattress could use an update."

The ambiance is very nice and enjoyable for relaxing, doing business, or enjoying the view.
The prices of the dishes are average, maybe a bit higher than the area's average, but not significantly more expensive in comparison. It's worth considering the convenience for hotel guests.
I was with my partner and had some dishes at the restaurant.
The breakfast is wonderful, complete with fruits, bread, proteins, sweets, coffee, tea, or juice, and there are some food that vary each day, and we can eat as much as we want. Highly recommend including breakfast in the daily rate for those who are suitable.
As for lunch or dinner, I can't say if it's worth it. In this case, it depends on where you are, as eating on-site at the hotel is convenient, but we had tastier and cheaper dishes at local restaurants.
The service was always exceptional; the hotel staff are wonderful locals and always have a good vibe.
I definitely recommend the breakfast. The lunch and dinner dishes aren't anything special. If I could choose, I would go to a local restaurant before returning to the hotel.
I didn't regret any dish I had but the burger could be better, cooked with fresh meat and a brioche bun. The banana split also didn't taste like very fresh ingredients. The chicken and mushroom pizza was lacking in filling. The carbonara pasta lacked that mmm factor in the mouth. So there's room for improvement.
Overall, the experience was good, I definitely recommend the breakfast, but for lunch and dinner, I would go elsewhere if given the opportunity.","I think the chef and waiter needed some coffee tonight.

We were the only two people in the restaurant, my girlfriend got her food way before me. Therefore we couldn't enjoy our food together.

When my food finally arrived the meat was cold.  I guess they forgot to put it in the microwave.

Overall the dishes were simplistic, low on taste and lack the soul you can find at a simple local Warrung. Maybe they can ask a chef there for some inspiration?

Multiple things we ordered were missing.  Service was very kind and apologetic when they noticed we had to keep reminding them what we ordered.

Their compensation for all this was a free glass of water ...

*Take in mind we haven't had breakfast yet, so high hopes for this tomorrow.","Simple and overpriced food with very limited vegetarian food options. Dishes we ordered were incomplete as per the menu description, partly cold, served 20 minutes apart (my food was cold when my partner's food came) and tasteless. We aked for spices and sauce since veggies are quite plain in taste, and after asking multiple times tabasco and chili sauce were served. It's aweful to say this, but I learnt how to make gado gado during a cooking class last week and I could to better than this restaurant.","Well, if you want to have lunch here, you will wait 30+ minutes just for 1 soup (we were only 2 people in the restaurant).

And when the mushroom cream soup will come, you will be totally surprised of portion sizeü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
They serve this soup in a small cappuccino cup.

Is it portion for small child? Or why is it so? I am totally hungry after this 5 spoon soupüò¢
And the price is 60.000rp.

The price for watermelon juice is 68.000 rp
Also quit big.

Place is nice
Service is good
But food is not worth this price.","Friendly and helpful servant.
Great food.
Cozy and comfy."

The ambiance is good and calming.","The cocktail was a no, I spent 100k for tasteless Mojito, can barely taste liquor, bitter mint leaves, too much ice. The staff told me probably it was made by a trainee. Not worth the price","We went there on Monday night for the AYCE 99K BBQ + Live Music.
