The healing energy here continues to bring transformation and blooming well-being and will do so for much time to come.  My gratitude to the whole Fuller Life Bali team overflows.

This is my absolute favourite place to stay when I come to Bali. I always stay here with Diani and Suhita in their beautiful traditional Balinese home. They live in a local village outside of Ubud (short scooter ride away) and it's so quiet and peaceful. Their property backs onto the rice field where you can see the sunrise and Mt Agung. The rooms are large with beautiful beds, local art and working bathrooms and closets. What I love most is connecting with the family, they went from being hosts to friends to family and it feels like home everytime I come. this is not just for me but a trend I notice in people who come to stay. They have the best care for their guests, pick you up from airport, cook traditional and western breakfast, help you with whatever you need and are always up for a chat about life. So grateful to know these beautiful souls and will keep coming back every time ‚ô•Ô∏è love you guys!! Love Brii x","Very nice environment and quiet setting. The hosts r very nice. The morning coffee they served is superb.

A few things can be improved: the hot water can be stronger and take shorter time to come. The aircon could be more performant.","We loved our host and the property - hotels are a dime a dozen in Bali, but to experience and to fully appreciate the Balinese culture, food and architecture, definitely come here for a stay. :)

We did 3d2n with them and it was like I was transported to paradise.

Plus points for us include:
- Crazy good wifi (no issue with video calls on teams and zoom)
- Strong and cold air conditioning
- Fantastic hosts who will do anything humanly possible to make your stay more enjoyable
- Extremely clean room
- Spotless bedsheets and towels
- Free breakfast

The only regret we had was not having booked a longer stay with them. üòä",It really is the house of happiness and we loved everything about our stay here. They provide amazing breakfast and give you lots of insight on the balinese culture. Thank you for having us. :),"This is the most beautiful house we have ever lived in.  Very friendly family.  I'll miss.
We are very lucky to find this house, thank you for everything ‚ù§Ô∏è.  Delicious breakfast every morning"

Overall I would recommend and buy again
This is an antique shop not a new furniture store","My husband and I shopped here while on holiday, we furnished our entire home (new build). We then had it all shipped back to Australia. We are so impressed by the quality & service we received, they sent emails, pics & updates through the process & everything was as discussed- an absolute pleasure to deal with. Some of the items were antique however as we stated we wanted ‚Äúbeachy white wash‚Äù they made it for us, no problem- the antiques we treasure the most is a boat conversion .. all the newly made items beds/bedside chests/ chairs tables .. incredible quality, good strong solid timbers, was easy to assemble when arrived. Highly recommend!! Regards Jess & Todd","Seriously over-priced Ikats. Had some nice large furniture pieces, but also a lot of expensive ""antiques"" that were in poor condition (as we found was common with ""antique"" stores.) Visit if you're in the area, but don't make a special trip out of it.","Attended several Bali Gong shops whilst looking for woodcraft and stone sculptures!!
No we didn't ask to go ! We asked our driver to take us to a certain warehouse that was recommended by a local with great prices in RPH. We were very happy exchanged details with them in view of purchasing several pieces.
We got back into the Golden bird car & stated to the driver could he take us to similar places 'yes a mistake ' . But up until now the driver was polite and helpful and hadn't appeared to be working on commission from BG.
On arrival at the 1st Bali gong the body language between our driver and the elderly owner of BG was they knew each quite well! we were looking around and asking prices on several different items and were quite impressed UNTIL we asked a price on a buddha head!!! He said 700, we assumed 700,000rph after all we are in BALI right - NO wrong, he was saying $700 USD are you serious I thought yes nice head but we are in Bali not the U.S. he then tried to say Oh but Mahogany wood! Yep with that colour boot polish that's the colour Not the timber! Nice try this was not our first trip to Bali & knew of this Mahogany wood or Ebony wood they tell you! Scratch & sniff (boot polish).
So we walked out and said to the driver ""the prices are ridiculous there' please take us somewhere that is genuine & in RPH!!! Yep you guessed it off we go and ended up at the 2nd shop of Bali gong , prices again absolutely crazy USD - spent about 3' there, when we said to the driver about pricing and that we wouldn't be buying anything his demeanour changed ! We requested to forget about taking us to any further places and just take us back to our resort! His silence on our 45' return trip was deafening.
If only he knew, had he done the right thing and taken us where we requested with genuine pricing WE would have paid him well for his honesty in the form of a comfortable tip - but for his dishonesty we gave him nothing.
PS: Identical Bali head found the next day in a village warehouse- Yep 500000 RPH App $50 AUD and was that Mahogany timber again üòÇüò¨üòÇ but at least priced correctly üëç","Love the store, plenty of goodies and pak Wayan was excellent"
