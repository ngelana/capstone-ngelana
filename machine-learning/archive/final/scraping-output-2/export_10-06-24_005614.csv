Kediri, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82121, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17991523004882217441,OPERATIONAL,+62 813-3914-0518,,"hostel, hotel, lodging, restaurant, health, food",5,111,,"The stuff is amazing. They are super friendly. There was once a communication issue, but they just resolved it and provided a free drink in return. The great thing is also that they offer daily yoga sessions for a reasonable price as well as massages which you can schedule in advance.

A nice to have is the ice bath. If I would‚Äôve known in advance, how calm and relax the places I would‚Äôve stayed longer. The place is a little remote, so it makes most likely sense to rent a scooter either there or arrival already with a scooter to have additional flexibility.","Gorgeous place, peaceful and secluded. Great yoga classes twice a day and the hostel is set in a way that it is easy to meet other guests and make new friends. The staff are so friendly and go above and beyond to help you.","We stayed there the first two nights of our Bali trip and we are planning to go back by the end of our trip.
Amazing place, nice staff. I had breakfast the first day and was delicious. There is a kitchen and you can do your own food if you want.
Two beautiful swimming pools. Both chilled and clean. Our room was really nice.
There are some activities planned. We did yoga and the price was cheaper than any other place for yoga. I highly recommend this place if you are in Cangu.","I really enjoyed my stay here. It was peaceful and quiet, away from the commotion of Canggu. I loved the ice bath, the free roaming chickens and how spacious the grounds were. 2 pools are awesome, yoga classes everyday, free drinking water. The waterfall nearby was really lovely! Cleanliness everywhere was clearly a priority. The staff were phenomenal, you can tell they really care and have good working relationships; they want to ensure you have a great stay. Really friendly and helpful, had really good suggestions. Everything made easy by them. The kitchen was a bit bare bones but it did the trick. I do wish there was an ATM nearby and more places to eat within walking distance. You can rent a scooter though to get you where you need to go. Fabulous stay would highly recommend! üôè","Enjoyed this hostel. It's excellent if you want to relax while still being able to socialize a little bit. The yoga-class and massages were excellent. The food and drinks were alright but I wasn't impressed by them. The granola bowl was pretty dry. It would be nice if they also served some kind of deserts or small snacks perhaps.
The location is a bit remote so make sure you get a scooter to get yourself around.
During my stay, the thunderstorm caused a power outage in my dorm which lasted for the remainder of my stay,l. that was a bit annoying, but they couldn't help it. However, they helped me to get a taxi to get to the airport when Grab was letting me down and the driver was amazing."

Feels like it was designed as a home with family living in mind. One of the paintings is Basquiat-esque and we found out it was painted locally by a contact of the owner. Loved it!

The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. It‚Äôs clear they have a good relationship with the owner.

The amenities at the villa are excellent and the furnishing is to a high quality with comfortable beds etc. Expected more mosquitos but was pleasantly surprised. I hope to return with a few more friends to make more of the facilities.","This villa is incredible! First time to Bali, stayed here for a yoga retreat. Location, staff, everything wonderful. Relaxing and beautiful surroundings.","I hate it when owners of properties put in fake reviews!!!

If you see all the reviews with 5 stars (there are plenty) have been done at the same time and all the reviewers have not reviewed any other locations except for Villa Les Rizieres.

The owner Pierre is very unreasonable, will treat you badly, try to put extra costs onto you, he even tried to intimidate by telling me that he knew people in immigration.

This property used to be on trip advisor and had accurate reviews, however it suddenly disappeared.

The villa is awesome, except Pierre needs to hand over the management.....look at all the early reviews and see the truth.","What a let down.
Had booked months in advance. Pierre was worried we would cancel with the current eruptions.
I assured we wouldn‚Äôt.
We had booked 8 rooms of the 12 and he said we had the option to use the other 4 if we had more people come. We booked it for 3 nights over New Years.
The day before we arrived he called and said he had booked out the other rooms to another party. But assured me the place was big and we wouldn‚Äôt cross paths.
When we got there he had closed the main villa off to the other party we had no access to any of the main villa. Apparently $4000 booking wasn‚Äôt good enough. Was pushed to the teak house which was nice if we were a party of 4 but for 16 people trying to sit round a 4 seater table was a joke.
I said why doesn‚Äôt he move the other guests into the small villa but wouldn‚Äôt negotiate. Very hard man to talk to. Not worth the hassle. Villa is a good 30 min scooter away from anywhere too.","Do your self a favour and do not stay at this property.

The villa and grounds are amazing, but the owner is aggressive, arrogant and threatening.

He will constantly change the conditions and try to get additional funds from you, additionally he will show up throughout your stay.

Again the Villa is great for a large group but the owner Pierre will ruin any memories from the holiday."

The Villa was beautiful Ans the service was great. A perfect getaway to relax and unwind.,"The best and most beautiful stay in bali so far! thank you for hosting, you all were amazing. and this place is so magical.",me and my girlfriend stayed here few weeks ago now and it was amazing. Would 100% recommend this place. I'm not one to write a review but it deserves one. Staff are so helpful and Nice. I'm not sure how much they make but they definitely deserve a pay Rise. Was very clean and comfy.  All round amazing. Only problem Was it's not to close to bars but they got scooters for cheap and that's all you need in Bali.,"We're staying in Ubud for holiday, and only stay one night in the area. We're looking for a place to stay overnight on Christmas eve, because we want to attend Christmas mass in Tabanan. Tabanan was never seemed like a resort-y place to stay, until we found this property.
Nestled in an extremely quiet riverside, the property consists only of one main building and couple of villas. The well maintained joglo was taken and reassembled here, surrounded by beautiful lawn. It's facing a lush greenery of the river at the back, giving us a complete privacy at pool area. Villa is clean, spacious, and fully furnished with anything you need: fully-equipped kitchenette (and I mean full with fridge, sink, stove, oven, coffee machine, cooking utensils and even wine rack), living room, dining table and all. Staffs are hospitable, they can provide you with pretty much anything. Gorgeous wooden joglo. Definitely in my bucket list for perfect place to spend Nyepi in Bali.","We had 2 months booked accommodation via booking. Upon arrival, instead of a 140m2 villa, this terrible room was waiting for a toilet outside the room. People didn't know much English, a big problem. Certainly not recommended."
