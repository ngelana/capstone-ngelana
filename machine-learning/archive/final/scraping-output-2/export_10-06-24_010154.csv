They got in the house style of coffee the Tabanan one is good. Fried bananas were great! Come here when the weather is clear so u can sit outside. Although it's near a busy street but u won't hear any honking or sounds of all the transportations.,"The place was really comfy and feels nice and strangely hard to find that i missed the road twice to come here, although the AC aren't cold enough for me, and the music was too loud that i can agree with other viewers the bass is too much prob can ask to low the volume if needed.
Overall its was a good experience assuming that you are fine with the loud music. You can sit outside if you dont want to hear the music too much.
The coffee and croissant was really good will come again and try the recommendation that was sold out.","pisang goreng just so so, manual brew it's okay","One of the top spots to visit in Denpasar for a great hangout experience is this place. I decided to try their Nasi Goreng Sambal Bali and it was incredibly tasty and flavorful. The rice bowl was also excellent. Moreover, they offer live music and have plenty of space available. It's the ideal spot to work on school assignments, get work done, or simply have a casual conversation. The staff needs to smile more :)",Thank you! I ordered coffee and pisang goreng. Everything was delicious!

Available outdoor and indoor dinning area..
Friendly staff with affordable price food and drinks.. Also kids friendly space..
Food is eatable even it's quite overcooked and looks burned...maybe because it's been cooked for alooong time..

Wish for your good luck and success in the future..","Green and hommy, great place to spend your day, located outside of the busy road, super spacious with affordable prices. Coffee was good, we had kwetiau pork belly and poutine fries, all was tasty and they give huge portion, suitable for WFC","The portion of the food is just right. Don't even ask how it's taste. It's superb.
The atmosphere really chill and really nice place to do work and hang out","Good place, wfc-able, nice service, pet friendly and all is just perfect! Recommended cafe here","Such a gem in the middle of Denpasar. The location is next to elementary school. There‚Äôs small entryway, but surprisingly they have spacious parking area inside!
There‚Äôs also indoor and outdoor seating area. The garden is big enough to have events.
Btw, the food is yummm and fair portion.
Have to try their salad menu and kemangi fried rice.
Their coffee is also good! Should try Dopamine for coffee and Summer Breeze for non coffee.
Overall great! üëç"
