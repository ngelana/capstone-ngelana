ChIJPyMyGsmP0S0R3HfajYtkNs8,Air Terjun Bertingkat,-8.1981764,115.13948009999999,"Jl. Raya Bedugul - Singaraja No.KM.11, Gitgit, Kec. Sukasada, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81161, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=14931232165136594908,OPERATIONAL,+62 813-3824-3649,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.1,57,,"There are several waterfalls in Gitgit area, and I think this one gets the least visitor. Probably because the name is in Bahasa Indonesia and the sign is not really visible from the main street, especially if you traveling from Denpasar/Badung, and barely visible if you traveling from Singaraja. And the sign only says 'Parkir Motor' or motorbike, directing us to a  gravel sidewalk.

I visited the waterfall on a Saturday morning, and there were no other visitors. The local people are nice, and the entrance ticket costs 20K IDR/person. The walk from the parking area to the waterfall is nice, not as steep as other waterfalls in North Bali. After a short walk you'll see a river, and just follow the path alongside it.

The waterfall is beautiful and you can walk in the river because the water is shallow (you can't really swim here) and the cobbles aren't slippery. It's so peaceful here.

Oh, don't forget to bring your own snacks/water, because there's no shop/warung near this waterfall. Just us and nature.","The mountain resort of Bedugul offers visitors to the area not only fresh air and beautiful mountain views and hills, temples, fresh fruits and vegetables, etc. but also some waterfalls that scattered around in its near vicinities.
They all have one thing in common. They are not located in the main road sides to Singaraja but requires a little effort of walk inside to see each of them. Some only hundred meters away of flat walk on foot while others down and up hills to visit. But they are all accesible to the average tourists of up to 70 years or less of age.
One of them is the one that located in the village of Gitgit that known as Air Terjun Bertingkat which stands for tiered waterfall. After 10 minutes of light walk from road side through fresh air green views of scenery on the way you will see the waterfall from its peak down to its base. Though the waterfall is not as high as you expect but it gives you nice clean and peaceful nuance of atmosfeer of the area. You can also go swiming if you like.
There you are. If you're happened to be on the way touring north Bali to Singaraja from Denpasar, you shall be arriving in the area around lunch time after visiting some tourist objects on the way. After taking lunch in some of local restaurants then you can drop by shortly to see the waterfall before continuing further to Singaraja.
Have a good time.","Mostly i would give 5 stars for the nature , this one as well its beautiful easy to access , however the road is small if you go with car there is a small park and there is no ticket when im going there and seems like there is toilet and ex local cafe that had been abandoned along side the river",One of the best in Bali,"The waterfalls are fantastic, and entrance is 20k per person. You will get pestered by the local guides, just be firm and tell them no and they will back off, once you get passed its a short walk and you get to see all 3 waterfalls and can swim in the water, it is a bit cold so have been warned. Would highly recommend visiting."

In fact, the road just ends in a series of narrow winding steep paths into the jungle.

GitGit public entrance may be down the hill a little more toward Singaraja. It was raining so we stopped looking.","Not the entrance, go up the road",I like and very nice,,
