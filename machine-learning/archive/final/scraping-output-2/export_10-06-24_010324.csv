There is a table where you can enjoy drinking food as you can enjoy drinking.I want to visit again next time,"I had a really cozy time chatting here with my cousins who I came with. There was a live music too and they sang pretty well and chose a good songs. Although the speaker sounded kinda like it about to burst (lol) overall I had a blast. Indoor (AC) and outdoor both are enjoyable, tho I prefer outdoor more. It's a 24hr cafe too so we can stay till drop. Take a note tho this place is pricey at least for me ü•≤ so I only ordered coffee.","Hidden gem for digital nomads and tourists. Big modern fusion menu with a variety of flavours. If you‚Äôre not in the mood for the same food you find everywhere in Bali then go to this place! Perfectly fits the sweet spot as for taste Asian/Western.

We were here during the day but on weekends theres music playing on the top floor.","Actually they have great ambience, DJ‚Äôs, indoor smooking area. The service were great but you have to call them more than 4 times until they notice you as the music bit loud and they didn‚Äôt always look around so that bit hard.
Also our drink came after 15 minutes after our food. Even we have to ask and they were ask our bill again so I think the kitchen forgot about our order)
Also the toast was too hard,  at first I thought it was just the edges but the whole toast does.
I ask for extra ice cream and mozarella. It‚Äôs around 6-7k/additional but see? I didn‚Äôt see even half of a scoop ice cream and they put Chocolate Sprinkles which is not everybody like it(I was just thought they might want or they think that will be seen more interesting but some people like me didn‚Äôt like it)
I ordered Avocado choco mousse, I get almost half of the glass size avocado with Avocado no sugar(I really like) and choco powder but I didn‚Äôt see any mousse. So I‚Äôm not understand what mousse they mean?
The last thing we ordered Strawberry smoothies and they gave us Mix Smoothies (banana and strawberry)üò≠ but luckly they want to change it.
So for the service was good but not for the food and how they explain their menu(details ingredient maybe) so we more understand?","Was one of the places I usually visit on the weekends. Cozy place, nice music & performer, foods‚Ä¶ so so.. but have to admit that I have experienced an unpleasant service. I was requesting a Bday surprise for a friend and the staff was ok-ing that and said it‚Äôs include as a complimentary (Free). Till the time as it‚Äôs decided, nothing came up and at the end a surprise happened but it‚Äôs not for us, it‚Äôs for another table. I talked to the staff and they simply said there was a miscommunication among the waiter/ss. BUT that miscommunication leads to an unexpected experience of a bday celebration for us. Such a shame! Tho they gave us a bday ‚Äúbread‚Äù 30mins later that we gotta celebrate personally without music.. still too bad!!
Hoping they‚Äôd train their staff more on delivering a great service."

Definitely will recommend this place to my starbucks lover friends.",This place will always be the first option if my bf and I want to continue our work. Cozy place with friendly staffs.,"Comfortable yet busy place!
I was surprised that this place is soooo crowded after 11am and i was speechless.
This Starbucks location is fairly new in town, strategically placed between Denpasar and Dalung area and you could easily spot it.
I was here (first time!) with my friend and i was a bit surprised that my ice latte venti size ‚òï was not included with sugar. SURPRISINGLY I LIKE IT! The coffee was not too bitter and i can enjoy the milk inside the mix!
Also, in the afternoon, i order Vanilla Cream venti size too! And it was  sugary, creamy, the caramel sauce on top was nice too and it looks cute! ü•õ I love it!!
Overall, the price (a bit too expensive for me) and the comfort for the place you could get (minus the crowd, obviously), i would rate this as 4.5 ‚≠ê/5!!!
I love it!
If i somehow have money, i would love to order the Latte again!

The parking area was quite spacious!
There is a drive thru place too!
They have broad options in their menu too!
They have separate area outside for smoking area which is BLESSING, i can breathe better!
The service is a bit meh, but not bad.
Would love to visit again next time!","The 500th starbucks in Indonesia, the place is beautiful they have a decent wifi, AC and toilet. They also served drive thru. Location wise is pretty strategic in my opinion. The AC is really cold (which is good during hot weather outside) this starbucks is really good for working, many charging socket. The service is really good too, like any other starbucks. The barista is friendly too. If I were close to this starbucks, maybe I‚Äôll come here everyday. But unfortunately I live far far away."
