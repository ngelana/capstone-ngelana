Friendly staff who's take care of this little place.","The scenery is really beautiful, nice and peaceful.  The staff were friendly.

I felt like the rooms themselves could‚Äôve been a little cleaner, small things like the toilet bowl needed some bleach, it was brown so looked a little gross and it was very dusty behind the basin. But not awful, it just looks so fancy you‚Äôd expect it spotless.

The internet connection is bad though, my phone often cut out or the tv would freeze.","A little gem, a little out of the main hustle and bustle of Canggu. Delightful spot! Clean, fabulous pool. Quiet. A short scooter ride to all you need. Highly recommend if you're looking for something off the slightly beaten track. Staff were great!","The people really made this place great. The communal set up makes it easy to meet fellow travellers with the ability to retreat to your room for privacy.

I was very disappointed with the lack of towels provided by the property. 2 towels only. No hand, face or pool towels provided. We had to use 1 towel for showering, washing hands and swimming.

Every time we asked for more towels staff said ""it is in the laundry, ask later."" This happened for 3 days, and we never got additional or replacement towels.

Due to the location being a little further away from the shops, a more equipped kitchen would have also been a nice touch.

There is some construction going on in the neighborhood but I did not find it to be bothersome.

Owner is friendly and likes to chat with guests and helps them with anything they might need to make their trip in Bali better. (Except towels apparently)","Nice and secluded area , the lush green rice fields approaching the accommodation are a delight for early morning walks , all the locals are friendly. The local temple that stretches out over the ocean is only a short walk and much less crowded than Tanah Lot. Rooms were clean and the surrounding area was quiet and peaceful at all times. Our team enjoyed the nice relaxing pool in front of the room and the staff were fantastic providing directions and advice on attending local ceremonies."

Hotel is new and comfortable, with nice view and spacious balconies. Location is very peaceful, 15 minutes bike drive from Canggu and very close to a nice Cemagi Beach.

The only thing that could be better is sound isolation of the rooms. There was a lot of noise, you can hear weather outside, people closing doors on their rooms etc.

Otherwise very good accommodation.","How I wish we had more days to stay at this beautiful guesthouse. I love their quiet neighbourhood surrounded by ricefields!

If you are in Cemagi, 10/10 recommended.","Totally recommend it! They have super delicious vegan options and even vegan feta. I choose the avocado, mushroom and vegan feta toast which was delicious and we also had the avocado regular toast, iced matcha latte which was super good and the Comma Blue Smoothie (also incredible). The service is super nice and fast and the environment super peaceful. Recommend it. We also had carrot cake to go!","What a gem of a place!

I love this little coffee shop just across from my daughter's school. It has everything I need to procrastinate for hours when I should really be working while my daughter is at school.

The food is great, the coffee even better, and the staff is really attentive and friendly.

Bonus points for knowing my order before I even walk in!

I spend more time here than at home ‚Äì if I was the owner, I'd start collecting rent right about now.

Comma has great food with generous portions and toppings, friendly service and warm ambiance. We especially enjoyed their polenta and bacon, a menu you rarely come by in Bali.

Kudos to the team for their awesomest hospitality, couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better Bali vacay especially with such a big group (15pax). The estate is a sprawling lush, painstakingly put together by the owners. It‚Äôs a well-curated estate of all-round splendour. The location is fantastic, as it sits along the south western coast of Bali, and is just a few stones throw away from Pantai Cemagi (black beach), which is a lovely party on its own, flanked by street vendors serving drinks and food. And if you like a nice meal or spa outside of villa, Canggu is only a few minutes drive from the villa. Truly good experience."
