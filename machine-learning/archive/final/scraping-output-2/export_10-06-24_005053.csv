Food 9/10
Ambiance 9/10
Service 8/10
Price 7/10 -- I paid Rp 80.000,- for 2 pax (as in the picture)

Of course, we will stop by again if we are in this area.","Amazing traditional Balinese and very affordable price. Great value, right next to beautiful hills in sidemen.

The menu is fixed and costs 40k per person (meal, hot tea), includes the following dishes:
- fried nuts
- barbecue fish
- steamed rice
- a chilly homemade sauce made of onions and chilly peppers
- green vegetables

They are very fast serving the food. There is fresh breeze and several options for sitting or laying down.

Last time i eat there i spent 60k for 1 person. I took small ice cream (5k). It's a nice place, but little bit more expensive than other places.","The best meal we had in bali.
Homely, wholesome, delicious.
Can ask for more portions as needed. It's meals only fixed menu.
Fish items mainly.
They sell packaged homemade local snacks as well.","Most authentic balinese sate lilit.its fish based.lots of spices.must try if you visiting Bali.everytine i come to Bali,i always make time to have lunch here. The place is a little further east.","Super local restaurant!
We were the only tourists at that time, and there was no menu lol
As we walked in and sat on the table, they started bringing food, they had only one option apparently, everyone was eating the same.
The food was good but extremely spicy for us so I ended up giving up eating all but it tasted really good.
The next morning I had diarrhea XD"

I donâ€™t usually order seafood, but the tuna satay and soup was so good! Accompanied with many delicious sides, the Sambal matah is incredible! No need to order, just sit down and they will bring you a serving for each person.","Clean place, nice waiter, hygiene food
So delicious with a lot of variety food
There was 2 kind of fish satay, 2 ""pepesan"" , 1 bowl of fish soup, 1 bowl of vegetable, 1 plate rice and ""sambal matah""
I order all of that with 1 bottle of mineral water and I order 1 plate again fish satay only 50K IDR
So reccomended for lunch, if you go to travel around klungkung and karangasem","Nice plce to enjoy sea food cooked in Balinese herbs. The tase is great, especially the fish soup.
Always like to come here.",Local food and was very good !,"A bit lack of taste, but has wide variety and good texture"

Spacious parking. Clean overall. Open air dining. Rather quick serving. Must try their fish wrapped in leaf (pepes).,"Delicious Local Cuisine to be enjoyed while on a long trip on the road.
It was reasonably priced as well packed with flavours !","I visited this restaurant since it was near the Padang Bai port. I asked the receptionist about the menu beforehand, and she said that they only served chicken and fish. We ordered five sets of grilled gourami, sate lilit, and a bowl of tropical fruit ice. The grilled gourami set included rice, plecing (made of water spinach, sprouts, fried peanuts, and sambal), sambal kecombrang (the essential sambal in every Balinese cuisine), and iced tea. The grilled gourami was tasty; my husband and I loved the condiment for grilling the gourami. However, the sambal kecombrang was not really tasteful. Then, the sate lilit was made of fish. I tasted a lot of grated coconut incorporated into this dish; the grated coconut made it a bit lumpy but still tasty. We liked the sate lilit a lot and considered it more delicious than the one we had the night before. Lastly, the tropical fruit ice was not too sweet for our liking, so it was comfortable to indulge in. The only thing that bothered me was the circumstances because it was an open space, so you could hear many vehicles passing by in front of this restaurant. It is indeed a safer and nicer option for Muslims with halal concerns, and I'd like to come back here again whenever I visit Bali in the future.","Great fish sate by the beach, highly recommend the awesome view. Also had my usual avocado milkshake which is a must in Bali.

Slightly more ex than the other famous sate place 100m away, but this view is great","I was returning from Amed to Changgu and my beloved Warung was closed. I looked at the next one and stopped by Rumah Makan Kumendel Kumendel for lunch. And I discovered another beautiful Warung of Indonesian cuisine. Convenient location, wonderful interior, a large selection of dishes for every taste. I recommend!"

Then the waiter replaced the fish head soup with a new one, this was better than before but still had a bad smell, and in the end I didn't eat the fish head soup.
