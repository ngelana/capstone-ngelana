The cons were :
why they put the socket behind the bed headboard, it‚Äôs difficult to reach :‚Äô),
Sometimes bad odor coming out from the bathroom to the point we need to open the bathroom window,
there are some stain on the bathroom window (not sure what it was). At night, only the security available, so when we asked some urgent questions, they couldn‚Äôt really help.

Overall i love the place. And the problems can still be solved independently wkwk.","The property is new and clean, the staff is very friendly, but the management style is extremely poor. As others mentioned, the wifi is slow and constantly disconnected during my stay.

The communal area is well designed. However the studio rooms are dark with very little natural light or ventilation. Also there was a constant odour from the drains. The studio rooms are not worth the price, however the loft rooms are much better.

The manager was rarely on site and his staff told me he only deals with issues if he receives an email first. When he did contact me it was just to offer excuses. He never apologised or offered any solution. The management style can be vastly improved here and you will have a fantastic property.

In conclusion, a nice property but not well managed and unfortunately very poor value for money. There are plenty of superior alternatives in the vicinity.","Visited a friend here.
Was very amazed, nice and cozy ambiance, clean and pretty rooms.
The garden view room had a kitchen and bathroom. Kitchen was complete with cooking set.
Available a small bar/cafe with lots of space to sit downstairs and upstairs.
Garden and a swimming pool.
Staff are friendly.
Pretty safe, when you go to the room area, you need go through the lobby and then a door that can be opened only by key card or the staff.","Really comfortable & thoughtfully designed living space for 1-2 people. Ideal for long-term stay as well. Big storage area, nice little kitchen & fridge, complete amenities, great coworking space & swimming pool. The staffs are responsive and really friendly. I was staying in the loft room with amazing garden view & great natural sunlight in the morning.","The pictures of the place look nice but the place itself is a mix of modern architecture, playschool and a feeling of prison. Big, grey concrete walls next to the pool, not very nice.

Before I came here last month, I checked the reviews and was actually expecting something better but the disappointment was big upon arrival.

I understand a place like this is a business but it seems someone tried to maximise profit as much as possible.
Some rooms have view on other rooms and some rooms view on a wall or on a tiny terrace (yes, tiny). In combination with the grey concrete, wich wants to be modern, the place is a little depressing for me.
With a little more effort and a different layout, maybe 2 or 4 rooms less, the place could have been nice but the owner squeezed everything too much. Poorly designed Rooms and furniture with no real concept, look like a funny playschool mix.

The place was reasonable clean, the rooms ok (not much space and missing comfort). The overall feeling in the place is just not really inviting.

Would I stay again? Nope, there is much better places which might not be as modern but feel much better..."

The villa is nicely maintained but their AC is a huge drawback. The AC in bedroom doesn't work efficiently. We had a tough time sleeping during night due to high humidity and AC not working properly. Everything else apart from the AC is very good. The staff was cooperative, helpful and very prompt to attend to our requests/queries. Could have been a 5 star rating but due to AC issue I'm giving only 3 star rating. Hope the management will look into the issue and do timely servicing of all Villas.

If you're planning for a honeymoon, you can consider this villa as an option as the private pool they offer with each villa is their distinctive offering.","I¬†must say that I am very disappointed with this resort .

Following are the things which I didn‚Äôt like at all.

When we reached the resort our luggage where kept just like that and there was hardly any kind of welcome from them . we were promised that we will be given a welcome drink but it never came.

We had to wait for almost an hour as the room was not ready however they did it provide some kind of snacks in that duration.

The villa which we were given is big . But there was only one AC in the upper room which was not sufficient enough to cool the ¬†entire villa rendering the ground floor not usable because fan speed cannot be increased.

The food in the villa however was decent and they changed the breakfast menu every day.

Now the most important disappointing fact of this villa is that the private pool was not at all maintained there were some insects which were roaming around and because of our tight schedule we couldn‚Äôt ask the housekeeping to clean the same. However it is the responsibility of the Villa to make sure that the pool is in usable situation before the guests arrive .

Another important disappointing fact is the washroom.

The washroom did not have any kind of Dry area unlike in the other resorts. So post bath the entire washroom was wet.

The washroom was very small and they did not give us any kind of dental kit when we arrived. What they actually gave was four shower caps and one soap and that is absolutely unacceptable.¬† Later when I requested for dental kit they obliged.

We checked in into the resort at 2 PM.¬† But I was unaware that the checkout time was 12 noon . it‚Äôs the responsibility of the hotel staff to let me know that what is their checkout time . during the checkout time suddenly I get a call 15 minutes before 12 noon that I need to check out in 15 minutes or else I will be charged for another day . I really had a very tough time to rearrange everything and get out in the same time . luckily I was not charged but a simple clarification ¬†of the rules at the time of check-in could have help me out in this case . so all in all what I want to say the overall hospitality ¬†is very poor and I‚Äôm not going to recommend this resort to anyone in future",The hotel is in a remote area as there r villas the place is too big...... It has its own pool..... but who needs it..... It's not clean every day. the food is bad no much veg choice. Hygiene is not keep at the food counter at bf time. Over all its a OK place if u have a big family to stay with. Living Room is tooooooo big...... takes long to open the door. I can only give 2 out of 5.,This is definitely a place for honeymooners.  The first day we got a couple massage which was awesome. The villa is quiet because it's 10 mins away by car from the beach. So it's a nice quiet place where u can relax. The pool inside the villa is an awesome experience and the staff is very nice and helpful.  Food is good but the menu is limited. But if u want to stay away from the crowd this is your villa.  Really liked the morning buffet.,"This villa is is in Seminyak area - a little old Bali. However there are plenty of good restaurants within a vicinity of 3kms which is walkable.

The villa has private pool. However the pool is not very big, but good enough to take a dip in hot summer. Make sure you ask for water purification as the water circulation is not switched on always.

Food at this place isn't great. It has got a small kitchen so don't expect a great food. Better you have it outside.

This is a right place if your entire family is on vacation. A big lobby, kitchen and two rooms can easily fit in 4 adults and 2 kids."

The owner did not warn me that he was going to build a new room, did not apologize (a human attitude would have completely resolved the situation, and I would have accepted all) and did not offer a discount for the inconvenience.

He also forbade the reception staff (I have no complaints about the reception staff, they are very friendly) to give me their contact so that I could discuss the current situation with him, and together we would try to find a solution.
Guesthouse agent Devi also refused to help me.
That is, I don‚Äôt have access to the owners, I don‚Äôt even know what they look like.

My floor vibrates, noisy work is carried out from 8 am to 6 pm (perforator, jackhammers, hand hammers).
I can't move out because I paid in advance. They refused to return it to me.

I would like to receive a humane and decent attitude towards guests from the owners. Here, alas, the owners are aimed at getting money from the residents. And stay in the shadows if the residents need something.","I stayed there for two and a half years since the covid started. There was a time when nobody stayed at the guest house at all and it was only me alone and I still paid my monthly rent on time.

But then, when everything was going back to normal and everyone could travel and Bali has become busier with the travellers, the manager decided to increase the price almost the double price than I used to pay and she was not nice at all by doing that, I knew that she just wanted to kick me out and wanted to get people who would pay more for the rent.

The old staff were all very nice, the new staff didn't seem to respect the guests and was reluctant to clean up the room. When I asked her, she always said oh today I had to clean up 3-4 rooms already and could clean your room tomorrow bla bla bla. And didn't apologize at all üëé","A lot of noise.
From morning till evening renovation works are carried out on the property with a drill and hammer.","Some rooms are quite nice, but the behaviour of the owner isn't good. They will kick you out and not honour their word, if they find someone who's willing to pay more money for the room. Cleaning is supposed to be twice a week but the staff is often reluctant and claims to be very busy.",Best guest house in kerobokan

He stood up just right when we turned our bike‚Äôs indicator to the restaurant and called the inside staff right away through his HT. Well done Pak. I‚Äôm a nearby living customer who happens to see this restaurant since they start to build it, after a severe curiosity I finally went there today! YAY! Just right after my gym session with my bestie, and was ready for some good protein! Surprisingly the place is sooo fancy inside, very clean with all new furnitures. All the staff were super friendly, well spoken and always so handy. The quality of the meats-food in general was excellent! No jokes. I was worried as the price is quite pricey for a new-grand-opening restaurant without any promo, but I gave it a try with a 169k++ package and paid 200k with the tax in the end. But..it‚Äôs worth every penny! I love how they cut the meat into a small piece so no food wasted. The meat is so tasty. The soup, sushi, everything is so fresh and good quality OMG OMG OMG I will definitely come back! Shout ot to all the staff who were there, you guys rock it! Never been so happy with the way people in a restaurant treating me. I only missed a lettuce ü•¨ as they don‚Äôt have it today, well it‚Äôs still fantastic anyway. 1000/10!","The entrance really set you up for what's coming.

It is a really nice entry with a lot of renovation going (hopefully its gonna be a good place once they finish with it)

The place is still crawling into what it want to be

Ambience
- place still a work on progress, so you can see some construction on the entrance area
- the entrance is a good idea ( guest can select their desired package, soup selection and number of pax) with a nice seating area (even if it was limited) to wait before your seat is ready.
- dining area is on 2nd floor and the lift is not working yet so you need to take the stair.
- dining area has a pretty nice design and the yellow lighting make it feel comfy.

Service
- staff are all smile and welcoming at the entrance which make the waiting place feel bright (i went at 1pm)
- 2nd floor staff might need a lot more training.
-- we are greeted with a table which is not ready (no grill tray, we have a leftover soup pot on our table from previous guest)
-- saw staff pushing crumb from table to the floor with the same glove they handle the food on the buffet
-- drink left empty on the dispensing machine
-- the hot meal are not heated when i arrive ( its teriyaki beef that i want to get, the meal was dirrectly under the ac so the fat from the meal are all hardening on the top layer of the food)
-- found a used glass on the hot drink dispenser tray and the staff didn't clean it up
-- utensil are still dirty and need to be cleaned (not only the one on the table but also the one used for buffet)

Food
- food wise, as what you expect from cheap all you can eat, not much to say about it
- i get a japanese spicy soup and it is really salty
- all the drink is overly sweet
- the grill really need more consideration since it is pretty deep in the groove and the flame jump up every time i try to flip my grilled protein
- sauce are not marked so i need to ask the staff what it is.
- they have a batter station, which you are supposed to put on your own plate on the table but the instruction is so small, people just dip their meat at the batter counter. (i admit i also did it üôÑ)
- also, you guys might want to put a margarine with brush on the table so that we can oil our own grill

This is my experience so far that i can put in word. Hopefully it will improve in the future","BEST SERVICE ü´∂üèºü´∂üèºü´∂üèº
The staff super kind and super helpful ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è","""Welcome to Shuka Grill, where the journey begins with the perplexing game of ‚ÄòSoup Roulette‚Äô‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt love starting their meal confused? But fear not, the real adventure awaits upstairs, where every table flaunts the post-apocalyptic remains of previous diners as everytable was full of used dished amd dirty table tops.Our warm welcome came courtesy of a young couple, deeply committed‚Ä¶ to their own flirtation, and far too engrossed to notice our grimaces of discontent. In the end, we didn't even eat and left before being seated. It‚Äôs believed the resto has been open for less than a week, but the disappointment hit like a well-seasoned veteran. We'll be taking our dining elsewhere, thank you very much!"""

Also interior design is really beautiful, i really liked it, it is a very good place for dating and hanging out with friends.","Awesome breakfast experience, truly a hidden gem that deserves more recognition.

The other staff, Aji, Danan,  Anang,  Nyoman are genuinely super nice and very helpful.  Hopefully the owner recognizes that they really make staying at Green Zhurga  a real pleasure.

Found another place around the corner for $50 per month power bill. Staff very friendly but for the price a rip off. Rooms very clean. Ants in the bed daily due to the living area is outside only a sliding door to close to put insects out. I never write negative reviews but the power bill plus insects for price just letting people know. You can get way better accommodation if none of this bothers you go for it ü§ô,"I WOULD NOT RECOMMENDED this place for a long stay! Generally,everything is fine, excellent cleaning, normal internet, there is everything you need! BUT we chose this place for a long stay for a long time, we asked the manager several times if we could live for several months? We were always told:  Yes, of course! As a result, a week before the end of our first month, they told us that our apartment was booked. How is this possible??? We were simply left without apartment, during the most tourist period, when everything is booked. They wanted us to pay a lot more to stay. This is a real skam ! But we no longer believe them, they can raise the price every time. Therefore, do not believe them! They can deceive you too.","They have a nice room and kitchen but my toilet needs a little bit maintenance but the shower was great.

They have a pool with nice view. I feel like in the movie, Encanto, yup that disney movie.

The staff are nice too."
