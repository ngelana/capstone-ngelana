Thanks Adhi, Anggreni and Warty Widyantara for your kindness :)","We felt so peaceful and exclusive here on a Friday afternoon in early April. Took a shuttle ride from Renaissance. No crowds. Not much going on along the beach here as there are only a few sandy patches to waddle and dip. More activities can be observed along neighboring beaches. More to explore if you walk along. We enjoyed our drinks, the lounge Ibiza vibe house music, and sun bathed until the evening shuttle ride back to the hotel for dinner so didn‚Äôt get a chance to try the seafood here. Warm and friendly service team. Quite shiok.","Fantastic place, good vibes music and amazing service from Ardi and the rest of the team ! One of the best time we had in Bali ! Will come back again for sure and I strongly recommend the place.","Came here as I was riding by, but also because it was part of Renaissance Bali Uluwatu. The beach club is really nice, there was a pool and sun lounges there, and you have a good view of the hills and the sea. Really nice chill vibe with good music.

We ordered cocktails in the pool, and enjoyed some of their FNB offerings. Food was just alright, but the experience as a whole was really nice. I could see myself spending the whole day there.","Amazing place to spend day with kids and family. Tons of activities, great multicultural crowd, amazing food during the all-you-can-eat buffet. Additionally, they have a modern  dj+live music to create full of good energy environment for adults as well.
Manager and staff are extremely careful for guests needs.
Overall we would definitely return for another Sunday!"

With the help of the planner and this amazing location, I had the most wonderful wedding experience.

This venue‚Äôs view is absolutely stunning. Imagine adding fireworks at night. Our wedding had about 80 guests and this place was more than large enough to accommodate them all.

There are also service staff 24 hours in the villa to help you with all your needs. Not free though, laundry and food and transport have to pay. Around 200k rupiah average for each item. But the staff are super helpful, like to clean up and pack up stuff.

Another thing to note is that the villa is really big but only has 6 rooms spaced somewhat far apart. So it doesn‚Äôt fit the cost villa experience if you‚Äôre thinking about one.

Most of our guests stay in other villas and hotels nearby and had to get a car in. The roads are not the easiest to navigate. Still possible to get a car/Gojek at 1am in the morning.

Overall, really really love the villa and the experience I had in there. Would highly recommend anyone holding a destination wedding there.",Villa Latitude Bali for wedding venue . The place and environment is so quite  suitable for private wedding party. The view very beautiful.

A modern villa with complete set of interior including an amazing speaker.
Service was quite a let down, but the villa tops it all",A friend of mine had his wedding there and it was very beautiful. It's a bit difficult to get there i think the route to the location on Google is a bit off. We're pretty much lost for 20 minutes within the pandawa area. It's actually NOT towards the beach but there's a little pathway from the main road. Anw they should put on signs. But otherwise great. It was raining which pretty much ruined everything. But property is superrrr nice.,"We couldn‚Äôt ask for a better wedding venue. This villa has a stunning view from everywhere but especially from the lounge, which has a dramatically high ceiling. The staff were all super friendly and efficient. The food was great and reasonably priced. The management was very attentive, and always responsive in all communication.

We really have nothing to complaint about!
The ambience is also soothing n top notch! The view too‚ù§Ô∏è!

Our dinner for the night was;

- Oxtail Soup (Sup bontot), served with white rice, some local crackers & local sambal chilli! : this should be the highlight of this restaurant!

- wagyu steak (i ordered 2 of this, its in LOCAL PRICING and it was really2 good! Cooked: Medium well!

- 1 sets of chicken wings

- 2 lemon tea : perfect

- es teler : tasted really good! (Blended ice with sweeteners!)

Not recomended;
- thai tea, üòÇ it tasted weird! Cant do a Thailand thing üòú

Ah another point, this place is clean!
Even the toilets are well taken care by these guys!","Great place to get a drink, this place offers the best views of Pandawa Beach.

We rented the property for a week and also rented the sister villa Tercana as well. We had 25 guests for the week and it was truly an amazing experience that all of us will never forget.
The support provided at all times pre and during our stay was first class and nothing was too much trouble for Ai and her team to manage.
We had multiple trips to various locations to coordinate along with massage requests and meals to arrange - everything went perfectly.
I cannot recommend this team and these villas more highly.","Took our family for a Bali vacation recently and spent a week at Private Villas of Bali - Villa Frangipani and it was an amazing experience with the privacy that we sought, away from the touristic centers of Bali. While the inner connecting road to the Villa compound was still unpaved, the villa itself is located on the Pandawa Cliff, between Uluwatu and Nusa Dua, and offers uninterrupted, breathtaking views of the ocean. All its suites and studios were well appointed along with a full-length center pool. The villa staff, especially Ai, Widi and their team, went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and cared for during our stay. They were always on standby to help us with anything we needed, and their attention to detail with guest preferences was impressive. The villa was well-appointed, comfortable, and felt very peaceful. The private Spa Terrace with incredible ocean views was a highlight of our stay where we enjoyed Balinese treatments that were arranged for us. The food and beverage arrangements were excellent, and we had our fair share of Nasi Goreng, and a full-fledged BBQ production on one of our final evenings!

Overall, we had a fantastic time at Private Villas of Bali - Villa Frangipani and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a private sanctuary to enjoy a luxurious and peaceful vacation in Bali. 'Matur Suksma' to the entire team for making our stay unforgettable!","We stayed at beautiful Villa Frangipani and the service provided was excellent. Staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating. View from the cliff was beautiful, perfect for photoshoot. Highly recommended for big group! Thanks Jose and team!","I booked Villa Frangipani along with Tirta Kencana for my wedding party to stay during my wedding recently. My guests in Villa Frangipani enjoyed the huge pool, nice views of the cliff side, and excellent service by the on-site butler and chef. Both villas also offer massages on-site which were enjoyed frequently by the guests. The only downside with this particular villa is that the air was stagnant and hot compared to Tirta Kencana which was located further uphill (same owner). I would recommend booking Tirta Kencana over this villa if it is available.","We came in August 2023 and everything was perfection. Our family is loud and noisy with expectations and changing schedules as we are all here for a big crazy wedding. Ai helped us turn all our messily laid plans into neat little excels and updates on a daily basis, even coordinating logistics and drivers. The villa is in great condition and it feels like staying at a 5 star hotel with a more private homey feel. You have butlers on site and staff who sleep on-site as well so they are available for night duty. There is an office in the villa next to the pool where there are dorms for the staff as well. So if you need anything, just give them a shout. The food is great, and the service and attitude is phenomenal. You are in good hands here and I cannot recommend this villa enough! I am really impressed by their meticulousness and care. 5 stars across the board except for location because it is secluded with a big development (Waldorf Astoria, according to google maps) that is still under construction nearby. Not their fault by any means and it‚Äôs far enough away that you aren‚Äôt bothered by the construction at all. But the road going to the villa I‚Äôm told will be fixed this year (as promised by the developer). Their team and attention to detail is in stark contrast to other villas in this estate (I rented a few different ones for my big family). Highly recommend the team at Private Villas of Bali and special shout-out to Robbert, Ai, and Jerry! üòò They deserve all the love."

Basically villa‚Äôs state is not very good - everything is not very clean, water taps are damaged by humidity and there is definitely an odor in every room (maybe it is humidity again, maybe not very clean AC I really don‚Äôt know). The sofa in living room and sofa in TV room were dirty, it was not very comfortable to lay down there psychologically.

The view, swimming pool and a huge living room are defined the best part of the villa. It was amazing during the day and evening as well. Every evening they light up the fire bowl and the vibe was very cool.

About the swimming pool: the water in the swimming pool was hard on children‚Äôs skin. Everyone had a rash, maybe because of the chemicals which clean the water.

The staff was very good, helpful, friendly, polite. Nothing to add.

So overall our stay was good. Villa needs some repair work and it will be amazing.","Great design, but poor upkeep. A list of broken things: most of the power outlets in the master bedroom and downstairs bedroom did not work when we arrived. Most of the air-conditioning was not cold. All of the rooms were dusty and dirty; no vacuum cleaner was initially said to be part of the staff's cleaning arsenal - no wonder the place was not up to requisite standard of hygiene. Sink in kitchen did not drain properly, leading to overflow. Downstairs bathroom shower does not drain properly.

Unpleasant for a family with 2 babies and 1 child.

Water dispenser did not work until day of stay, meaning bottled water only and no cold water.

Fridge was not cold enough to freeze milk.

Ostensibly a family friendly villa but too many failings to truly be so.

Only the view and design save Villa Amita from a 1 star review from me. Staff was kind and meant well.","We were expecting a clean villa with great view. We got the great view, but not a clean villa for my grand kids.

AC in the master bedroom and living room was broken, some needs servicing and 3 need parts replacement that it took them 3 days to fix.

Out of 7 days of our supposed family holiday, we spent 3 days having to move people around different rooms just to find ones with cool enough AC and clean enough bathrooms for showering.

We had to deal with not so clean corners, moldy wooden floor, sticky floor, leaky kitchen and dirty plates for the rest of the holiday.

It‚Äôs not exactly enjoyable. We would‚Äôve moved to a hotel if the management agreed to give us a refund for the rest of the stay, but they didn‚Äôt.","Family and I stayed here after our wedding for 4 days. General experience was good, but a few issues impacted the stay. All in all, OK stay. Good for peace and quiet, but think there are other options offering better value around Bali.

Pros:
- Villa is nice and modern.
- Good size swimming pool and large rooms
- Staff were attentive and service was good
- Decent menu selection

Cons:
- Location is remote (good for peace and quiet), so fairly difficult to get to. Taxi / Grab / Go-jek drivers got lost on a few occasions. This means also difficult to get food if you choose not to eat Villa catering. Realistically nothing within walking distance from Villa and transport is a must.
- Hot Water / Water was not consistent in all rooms. Master bedroom was generally fine, but other rooms had issues with lack of hot water at times. On one occasion there was no water at all - but staff solved in half an hour once notified.
- A few air-conditioning units leaked
- Marketed as having free transport to Pandawa beach, but when we asked, they said they no longer had a driver and it would cost is 200k.
- Some portion sizes of food were a bit small
- Specific incident to our stay: Tea/Coffee is included in the breakfast. However this was not served to us after the first day. As such a few guests assumed the coffee pod machine was the coffee and used that instead. Upon check-out, a bill was raised for coffee consumed (we thought it was a reasonable to assume that because nothing was served, the coffee was available via the machine). After speaking to the Managing Director (located offsite in Hong Kong), she insisted that we still pay for the coffee pods, even thought she acknowledged the staff had made a mistake by not serving us coffee/tea at breakfast.","We expected a 5 star luxury villa standard as the owner described on Airbnb Plus, but it was not even 3 star standard.

- 2 out of 3 AC's in the master bedroom was broken since the first time we turned it on. 1 required part placement, the other one required outdoor unit placement. All was only done on day 3.
- Moldy wooden floor in Orchid suite next to the bed
- No hot water in all bathrooms except master bedroom and frangipani suite
- Kitchen was leaking
- Unhygienic bathrooms where it's smelly from poor ventilation, leaking and peeling wall paint
- Other defects that don't give the sense of hygiene and general comfort

Due to misrepresentation of the description and pictures on Airbnb Plus, we brought 2 babies and 1 kid to stay in this villa, which turned out to be an unpleasant holiday.

The owner stopped responding after the second day where she replied ""Just like any house, things got broken down."""
