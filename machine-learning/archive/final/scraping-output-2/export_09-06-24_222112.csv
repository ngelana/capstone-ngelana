ChIJq74OYQWS0S0RNPNEWXQtq-w,Villa Manuk,-8.1585808,115.2007039,"Dusun Manuksesa, Desa Bebetin, Bebetin, Singaraja, Buleleng Regency, Bali 81171, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17053774391705662260,OPERATIONAL,+62 813-3866-5533,,"swimming_pool, sports_complex, lodging",4.6,83,,"There's something that makes this place different from the other six places we stayed at in Bali. It's authentic, rustic, peaceful, blissful. Their pool and garden are beautiful. The staff goes at great length to accommodate the guests. For example, we asked for a coconut and the guy climbed a coconut tree in their garden to get us one!","It was a great place to get a break from the city life, the staffs were really helpful and hospitable. We reached at night and couldn‚Äôt see the place clearly at first, but was totally in awe to see the nice view in the Villa the next morning.

The breakfast was good and served with fresh cut locally grown fruits. Dinner was delicious.","We didn‚Äôt expect that place will be so beautiful (it was a bit difficult to find a place after sunset) the surroundings, mountains, well -groomed garden, a loot of flowers and trees. The staff proposed to serve a breakfast near a room and it was veeery lovely

If you are travelling here by bike it‚Äôs better to choose a ‚Äúroute for cars‚Äù because some paths are very difficult for bikes","Villa Manuk is finally open for guests again. It was not my first stay here and it was pleasant and relaxing as always. Lovely staff, good food (you can order now from the auntie next door), beautiful view, refreshing spring water pool and great Balinese massages. Bali‚Äòs tallest waterfall, Sekumpul, is located just nearby. The villa is also a good starting point for trekking tours or walks in the rice paddies.
Please be aware that the villa is situated in the middle of a village. You will hear residents going about their daily lives, dogs barking, roosters crowing, etc.",Owner is an amazing family (Indonesian & German) who understand the needs of locals & foreigners. Beautiful villa with all natural. We went there to share the idea of *how to take care your own plastic* to the local kids & Teens. This successful event are super nice oragnised by the owner and friends.  ADDITIONAL POINT we managed to spend time to the best water fall is who is near to this village.....15 Minutes drive + 30 minutes walking distance.
