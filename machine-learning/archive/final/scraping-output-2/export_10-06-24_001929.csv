The resort is secluded and away from the craziness of central Ubud.

We stayed in a room overlooking the rice paddies and it was worth every penny.

The staff are lovely and friendly. The breakfast is awesome with a lot of variety and it’s very easy to eat nutritiously.

There are 2 pools but we primarily used the one in our room. The spa is a bit pricey but worth splurging if you want a special treat.

The shuttle to central Ubud is free and easy to use in addition to using Grab to get around.

We did the Wellness package and enjoyed everything it included like the meals and massage.

Definitely worth coming here especially because it’s quiet and comfortable.","I almost have no words to describe our incredible experience at Kappa Senses. Just the best resort I have ever stayed in. My friend and I stayed at KS for 3 days. I needed some time off from a busy life with young kids, she just recently beat cancer - we both needed a place of calm and beauty and self care. KS exceeded all our expectations. Where to start? First, the amazing, kind, professional and thoughtful staff, who went above and beyond to ensure we felt right at home (and we certainly did even in such a short amount of time!). I also have to mention the location, secluded and away from the hustle and bustle of Ubud, surrounded by gorgeous rice paddies. The design of the resort, the pools, the restaurants and the villas - everything was just so thoughtfully done and high quality. We appreciated the beautiful materials being used throughout. The buffet breakfast was incredible, the fitness centre has everything you need, the gardens were gorgeous. There are some really good eating options as well at the several restaurants, all very good quality. We left the resort once and took the shuttle to central Ubud and all we wanted to do was to go back to the haven that is Kappa Senses! 200% recommend. I've already recommended the resort to my friends and will definitely come back with my husband for a kids-free getaway! Thank you so much to all the staff. I wish I could individually thank you (if only I was good at remembering names...).","We are impressed by our stay at the Kappa Senses resort! The 7 days were perfect. The resort looks in reality a lot more impressive than on the website. It’s also quite big but without many villas.

- The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and everyone was always smiling. Our requests were taken care of immediately.
- The breakfast was outstanding with a variety of healthy bowl options, all kinds of eggs, fresh pressed juices, but also many delicious sweets. We tried the food in the other restaurants as well and always had a good meal. A lot of the ingredients comes from the own garden in the resort.
- Our villa and view felt like home after a few days. It’s very calm and hidden, so you don’t see anyone else if you don’t want to. We also enjoyed the private pool a lot.
- Kappa Senses offers a variety of complementary services: Shuttle to Ubud city, foto session, Yoga - all worth it.
- The spa is a bit pricey but we had very good treatments there as well. Also very friendly staff!

If you want to enjoy a relaxing week in Ubud, Kappa Senses is perfect!","Stunning resort. I am still here and wish I didn’t have to leave. Cannot fault anything! The location is beautiful, the staff are so warm, kind and welcoming and the service is 5 star. The room we stayed in was sensational, the view is mesmerizing and the facilities are exceptional. And then there is the food! The breakfast is so so good! Huge selection and the pastries are the best I’ve ever had. Wish I could fill my suitcase with croissants! Every meal has been perfection, from in room dining to the many restaurants available. The spa is first class, I have had 2 massages, hydrotherapy and a facial and the facilities and staff are of the highest quality. I highly recommend Kappa Senses. Totally blissful!","Immaculate service, lovely staff and beautiful rooms! Breakfast was lovely and the restaurant has great food! My husband and I loved our stay here and will definitely be back. Thank you to the kind staff who made our stay here so great."

Also we get to see and experience local rice farmers and the whole process here.

If you want to avoid crowd and see the rice fields and swing, this is the place.",We really enjoyed our walk among rice fields. Be prepared to go up and down all the time under the heat. Quite big area to explore and very nice views. I would recommend to visit this place who are fine walking some distance and explore on their own.,Wow very very special area to visit. Do it early in the morning a lot of tourists is coming later.,Enjoyed Treaking through the village and rice patties.  Was a fun and cultural experience.

I highly recommend adding it to your itinerary. The setting is simply stunning, with a rice field right next to the cafe and breathtaking sunset views. It's the perfect place to relax and enjoy a delicious meal while taking in the tranquil ambiance. My friends and I spent hours here, savoring the atmosphere and the delectable food. The chicken karage and chicken salad were particularly outstanding – simply bursting with flavor! The staff is also incredibly friendly and helpful, always ready to assist with a smile. I'll definitely be back for more!","Cafe is right in the middle of rice fields which is an added advantage, looks beautiful to have your food looking at the beautiful sky and rice fields. Staff is super polite and super sweet, food is delicious too.. I would recommend Edery's breakfast and chicken burger they were awesome.. would love to visit again if I came to Bali again.","Found this cafe outside of town, adjacent to some rice fields. Great place for a chilled brunch or lunch, or even just a coffee while taking in the view. The staff are friendly and the menu has a good selection of western food. I can recommend the Chicken Cordon Bleu and the coffee. Also the fresh cookies (which sell-out pretty quickly). Definitely worth a re-visit!",Nice and cozy place with a great view of the ricefields. I've visited it already many times and the food is always good and coffee is really great with a very wide choice to choose from hot and cold. I'm in love with the crepes but sandwiches are great too. Curry udon and cordon Bleu definitely worth trying as well. Very comfy place to come and sit with the laptop while enjoying the coffee.,"the view, foods, drinks and services are outstanding!! really recommended!"

A perfect balance of being located not far from the centre of Ubud but still overlooking scenic rice fields, it was a peaceful accomodation to return to after exploring the surrounding area. I highly recommend this beautiful property to all travellers spending some time in the region.","Villa Neyang is by far the best Villa in Ubud! Mr Khan and his son, Okta, made us feel at home and were very helpful throughout our stay. An amazing Villa that embodies the true Balinese living style, surrounded by nature’s beauty. Highly recommended for those who wish to enjoy the tranquility of Ubud!","The best place to stay near Ubud. We stayed here more than a week as part of our honeymoon. The people are amazing and everything was perfect!

Location:
The best location for nature lovers that want to be close to the city as well. In Ubud is very busy and some places are dusty and there are almost no sidewalks. In the deep jungle there are lots of wild animals like big lizards and monkeys in your room. But in this villa you get the best of both worlds. It's very calm, the view of the garden and rice fields is amazing and you are 15min by car from the city, which is very convenient.

The vila:
The style of the vila is very authentic and in classical balinese esthetic. We had a nice porch with a table where we got our breakfast. The bed was really comfortable, and you have options with the pillows if you want softer or harder. The bathtub is bug enough for 2 and you get that luxury feeling mixed with nature.
The service: we got breakfast every morning that was included in the price and was brough to our terrace. It was very delicious with different option. We chose mostly the balinese one with a banana pancake, some fruits and a coffee. The towels were changed every day, and our room was cleaned and the bed was made daily as well. We got complimentary water and there were some small things like a sowing kit and tooth brush in case you forgot yours.

Extra services:
We were very happy to find out that there was a laundry service which was really good and they took our things from the villa and brought them back in perfect condition, which saved us a lot of time and was very helpfull on a long trip. Also there is a free shuttle service from the vila to Ubud and back provided by the hosts. This was so nice and saved us a lot of time and money on trying to find a driver from the apps.

❤️The hosts:
The most warm,  kind hearted and adorable hosts we ever got. We are so thankful to Khan, the owner and his son Octa, as well as their whole family for taking such good care of us and making our stay so wonderful. They drove us around, arranged for our transfer, told us so much about balinese culture and history and overall it felt like staying with friends. They are honest, nice and good-hearted people, always smiling, humble, hospitable, hard working and educated. We are so thankful we got to stay at their villa and experienced Bali through their view. They will stay in our hearts as our family in Bali❣️",Beautiful hotel in a quiet location . Perfect to unwind. super friendly staff and host. Good breakfast. Easy communication via WhatsApp.,"We are so surprised how this hidden gem is undiscovered by a wider audience. Nestled in the middle of rice fields, this villa is a true luxury retreat from Bali's crowd. Its authentic charm, blending Balinese tradition with modern comfort, offers an unforgettable experience.

We travelled to many places around the world but Khan and his wife are the kindest host we have experienced so far.

It's hard to find another hotel at this price with such incredible value. For those seeking tranquility, this secluded villa is an absolute treasure that'll leave you enchanted."

The owner is very helpful and personally took us for our tour. He was very prompt and helped us for any query. Villa staff also took good care of us and served us breakfast as per our desired time.
Kitchen utensils and cooking ware needs upgrade, as we used the kitchen many times and felt the need for the same. Small things can be taken care of which can make stay more comfortable.
Overall will recommend to stay.","Very beautiful villa which is right beside padi field. Friendly owner and chef. Be prepared for noise from insects, roosters, birds which is natural in such rural area. Hair dryer is in kitchen drawer. Night time ubud is cooling at 22-23 degree. Walk over to kappa resort which has a few upmarket restaurant which can be quite awesome experience that comes with price tag. Overall kudos to the owner and staff for the good host.","Stayed here for three days. Absolutely lovely place and as for the hospitality, cant fault it. Beautiful people. Breakfast was great and for a small price that cook you dinner in the evening with advance notice (24 hours needed). I got excited about evening meal coming because it was so good. Set in the middle of the rice fields, the views were amazing and made this truly a unique experience. They could not have been more hospitable and helpful. Would have no problem recommending this place. And to the older gentleman who owns the property? ...Harry says Hi lol","We stayed here with our family. It is absolutely beautiful and the rooms are spacious. Our kids loved that the living area was stocked with movies that they could watch. We all enjoyed swimming in the private pool especially our daughter. If you want somewhere more relaxing and away from the hustle and bustle this is the place to stay.

The breakfast was wonderful and you were able to request what you liked including eggs any way, pancakes (our favorite), nasi goreng which is fried rice.

The family is extremely accommodating and were able to answer any questions and make recommendations. The view of the rice fields is spectacular.","i had the best stay ever.I always looking forward for the breakfast, its so delicious, best thing to start the day. The hospitality is incomparable and I wish i could stay longer. Really the highlight of my trip."

I assure you that the part of the pastries and chocolate are more than excellent, high quality and I enjoyed the beauty. In the afternoons we find these delicatessen proposals in Bale Gourmet, a charming outdoor bar where we also find specialty coffee or unique blends of local teas. One of my favorite places is the Kelapa restaurant located in the main pool, offers delicious a la carte breakfasts that will excite you and also food from lunch to dinner in a beautiful environment, atmosphere between chic, contemporary and overlooking the pool and rice fields. If you want to enjoy Pan-Asian proposals with a touch of creativity and an innovative presentation, I recommend Kokokan, there you will have a gastronomic experience overlooking the rice fields",Awesome service and beautiful interior.
