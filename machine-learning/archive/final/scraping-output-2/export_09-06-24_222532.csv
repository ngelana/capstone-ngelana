The pool, right by the beach, was stunning. The environment offered endless activities, made even better by the helpful owners and staff who helped me with arranging everything. Unforgettable stay! We highly recommend.","Had an amazing stay here. Beautiful villas, wonderful kind staff and super chill vibes. Its was so relaxing to chill by the pool and hear the sounds of the waves from the sea.","Bali Sea Villas was nothing short of exceptional!! Stunning views, quiet and peaceful area made even more better by Iluh! Iluh was the perfect addition to making our stay fantastic! Her cooking is amazing and she is so sweet and kind.

All staff at the property were kind and friendly. The gardens surrounding the property were beautiful. Each day they were getting worked on and the area was kept clean at all times.

If you are ever in Bali taking a trip to North Bali Sea Villas is more than worth it!!!","We stayed in Villa Bidadari (the Bali Sea Villas has 2 villas) and this is such a beautiful place and the staff does an amazing job.
Ketut makes sure everything inside looks good, but even more important she takes care of all cooking (by request) :-). There is a menu with many suggestions, but if you want anything else, most likely she can cook it as well! She really is an amazing cook.
When Ketut had a day off we went to the Bora Bora restaurant (see my other review), its close by and offers a pickup.

Everything outside also looks good with Kadek taking care of the garden and pool. If you like a coconut, just ask him and he'll get one for you from the garden itself. Can't get a coconut fresher than that :-)

And feeling secure at night is no problem with Agus watching out. I don't think its needed, but better be safe than sorry! ;-)
TIP: We invited Agus several times over for a drink, he kindly shares a few stories about the village and local activies.

From here we made several trips, suchs as:
- Snorkeling at Menjangan
- Dolphin seeying (with pickup from the beach at the villa)
- Batur vulcano hiking tour to see the sunset from the top
- Visiting the Candikuning and Pulaki temple
- Jet skiing in Lovina
and many places more.
Our driver Gede drove us around and gave many suggestions of places to visit (also just for shopping).

The bedrooms have airconditioning and Wifi is also working great, its fast enough to watch a online movie ;-)

And no need to go out for a massage, just have Ketut arrange to have someone come by. We enjoyed this 4 times, still miss that!

I saw some reviews mentioning a bad road to the villa, well good news: 4 months ago a proper road from the mainroad to the beach was made. Now only the last few meters can be a bit bumpy.

In Bali basically there is a lot of waste (especially plastic) just everywhere, which is a pitty. On the beach at the villa this most often is also the case. This is is being cleaned up several times a week, but if you walk along the beach (or anywhere in Bali for that matter) you'll basically see waste everywhere.

For anyone thinking about going here, just do it, you won't regret it.","We stayed nearly 4 weeks in the villa Cahaya. It was the most relaxing time I had in my long live. Iluh was the best cook letting us know how Balinese food tasted.  We enjoyed her ""pampering us"" very very much. The villa is beautifully kept and if someone wants to experience Balinese hospitality then he should choose Villa Cahaya. We thank for the wonderful time we spent there."

From the moment we arrived, we were taken away by the beauty of the property. The photos can not capture how grand the house is and how large the pool and gardens are. We had to pinch ourselves that we were staying there.

There were two story high ceilings, giant doors and windows, stunning balinese architecture and paintings in every room of the house. The gardens are immaculately kept by the lovely gardener. I loved walking around the garden and pond, taking in the beauty of it all. The view of the ocean is something special, along with the sounds of the waves. The pool was the perfect temperature and absolutely enormous.  Floating around the pool with frangipani flowers slowly dropping beside you is bliss.

Make sure you book in a massage with Kadek (different from the housekeeper Kadek). There's a massage table by the pool to use.

The housekeepers, Kadek and Komang, will look after you like royalty. They will make you pots of tea or coffee and cook you the most delicious meals on the island (for a fraction of the cost). They are such lovely women. So caring and kind to our kids, and made us feel so comfortable. Kadek's husband Putu is amazing too, so be sure to use him when you need transport.

Nearby resorts such as Nalika offer free pick up if you want to go there for breakfast,  lunch, or dinner. Their pastas were the best I've had in years! They also do happy hour sunset cocktails and drinks. Warung Segara Mas, next to it, has amazing seafood and a great place to watch the sunset. Super super cheap, but you'll have to pay their driver.

Do not hesitate to book this place.","It's been a few days and I'm still absolutely enjoying memories of our stay here. If you've ever doubted that Bali is paradise, just come visit Villa Senjah. Kadek and Komang made our stay so comfortable that we never left the gates of the villa. We spent our time just enjoying the home and gardens and jumping in the pool between delicious meals. I felt I needed to pinch myself multiple times during our stay because I just couldn't believe this place is real. I've been recommending it to everyone - friends, family, random people at the airport...","Lovely villa, great location and wonderful staff. Just a shame the beach is not very clean - not their fault though.",Nice house with a very beautiful view.,Good
