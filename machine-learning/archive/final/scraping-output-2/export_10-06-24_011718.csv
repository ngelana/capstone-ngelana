Vegan & gluten-free labels they asked for any allergies when I ordered, there were some misprints in the menu with gf so it‚Äôs best to check with the staff.

For the price, quality and portions are totally fair and equal to similar places in Bali.","Ino was the best, most inviting and welcoming waiter! He made our first meal in Bali very enjoyable.

They got promo for breakfast, for every purchase of their breakfast menu, you got either juice or coffee for free.

One minus is that the place can feel hot and humid because their concept is open cafe, they probably either need standing AC or more fan","Mushroom SoupüçÑ was the best mushroom soup I have ever tasted.

You could hear every little noise from outside. Sadly, the staff really need to learn how to do their job better. They didn't come to help me at the reception; they just stared at me from the restaurant until I asked them to check me in. We asked for an iron, but they took forever to find one, and then said they didn't have it.","I really like the wooden interior. The resort is clean and comfortable. The food is delicious too.

All the wooden chairs and tables were extremely dirty.

The location was noisy, it's close to a main road, and unfortunately by the time we visited, there was a construction by the side.

If you are not disturbed by the dirt and noise it's the perfect place to stay in the centre of Uluwatu.

Good thing it has an equipped kitchen you can use! It is used mostly by tourists with a higher sense of cleanliness so it's much cleaner than the rooms.

We stayed there only because we had no other option.","Plus points:
The guest house located in a good location where has many restaurants around yet very quiet

I came here with friends to show them some food that I grew up on and I was so embarrassed coming to this restaurant. Firstly, menu is only in Russian which is ignorant because it excludes any other tourists that want to come and try the food. Owner only wants Russians to eat at his place, which is why me and my friends who are from all over the world won‚Äôt be coming back. My friends couldn‚Äôt read anything, and the Indonesian waitresses couldn‚Äôt help either, so it was all down to me translating for a table of people. What‚Äôs also weird is that inside it has a Russian decor, but the waitresses wore traditional Indonesian clothes?

The portions- laughable. So small! And for the price it‚Äôs ridiculous! We left there hungry!

The waitresses attitude wasn‚Äôt welcoming, maybe they were only instructed to be kind to Russians which is what I noticed when some Russian couples walked in and their whole attitude changed, but the fact that I was with Germans, Australians, South Americans etc meant that we got a different treatment. Definitely need to change staff! Bali has such high standards for food and staff that this service was a joke.

Considering we were the only ones in the restaurant the food took so long to come, so we decided to pay for what came and then tell the staff we don‚Äôt want to wait for the rest. Then as we leave the food comes. It‚Äôs just not good enough!

Owner came down a few times, any decent person would maybe smile or say hi to the people who are giving him business, but nothing. Just a cold stare. Sometimes I hate the attitude of my own people and they need to re think the way they run business! There‚Äôs a reason why this restaurant has a below average rating compared to other restaurants in Bali.

Don‚Äôt bother going there because there are so many amazing options in Bali with high food standard and service, and this one is not worth it!","Ordered few times from Grab and now visited first time in person. Best Russian food around here for sure. Pelemeni, ceburek, meat - pretty authentic. Nastojka also topchik.

The color of pandan pancakes were really chemical colors and the taste was not really natural üòñ anyway the atmosphere was great!","Great breakfast spot! Cheap in comparison to other cafes in the area but still providing the good quality food! I would recommend the breakfast wrap, avo toast & smoothie bowls! A free drink with breakfast is a nice touch also.","SO GOOD! Cheap prices with a nice environment, free water, free banana. The smoothie bowls is only 40k. They have vegetarian opinions. A big nasi campur options. Recommend this place 100% They also have a second floor and the staff is super cute and always smiling üòç Local price with a western vibe","We lived 3 weeks in Ungasan and came her daily! The food is fresh, tasty and they have variety and local prices. The staff is so kind and helpful! Also no problem to work upstairs or downstairs with the laptop cause there are enough plugs, the Wi-Fi is ok. What I like most is that they have so many vegan options. I recommend to order better from the menu than from the buffet. My highlights are the Rainbow Buddha Bowl & the Charcoal Detox Smoothie Bowl :)"

I love the rustic cozy feel of the bungalows and the sea views to forever. Our room is amazingly clean and quiet too. Thank you Heny and Po‚Ä¶ you guys have been so welcoming! We loved our time here!,"We had a great stay at Uluwatu Sunrise. It is such a beautiful place, the bungalows beside the pool area and also the room with the bathroom both were perfect, everything was clean too. Staff was very nice and helpful as well, we could rent a scooter through them which was very convenient. The area feels like an oasis in busy Bali and is the perfect place to relax and end the day. Cafes and restaurant are quite close, about 5 min with the scooter. I would definitely return!","Uluwatu Sunrise offers a tranquil escape with breathtaking sunrise views. The guest house's cozy ambience, attentive staff, and comfortable amenities create a memorable stay. A hidden gem for those seeking serenity.","Our favorite place of 3 weeks in Bali - just everything was perfect: Friendly and helpful host, nice surroundings with gorgeous view, very clean room and amenities, comfortable bed. We even could rent a scooter without any hassle. The location is very close to plenty of shops and cafes, and also the beaches are just a quick bike ride away. Recommended! Thanks for having us :-)","As you enter Uluwatu Sunrise you are met with a beautiful pool, immaculate garden and adorable villas. The bed is comfortable, the room has excellent cooling, and the bathrooms are cleaned daily. The owners are absolutely lovely people who make the stay even more of a pleasure. There are also some excellent cafes on Uluwatu street, just a short walk from the villa. It has been a fantastic experience staying here. So gorgeous! Thank you for having us üòÅ"

The Crispy Mushroom Burger is sooooo good, highly recommend you try it! We had x6 over our stay in Uluwatu! They're phenomenal! üçîSuch kind staff, chill vibe, parking outside or across the road, busy spot but we'll worth the visit! Cheesecake and deserts are top quality too! Matur Suksma! üòãüß°","Tried the vegan cheese burger, meatball pasta and dumplings.

Vegan cheese burger - It was soo difficult to eat. The patty was made of red beans - Now anyone who knows about beans, they would know that they are really dry and you really want them soaked in sauce. I had to drink 2 glasses of water just to be able to eat the burger. This burger was claimed to be the best selling burger by the staff but I doubt it and it might have been the staff member's favourite. I have a feeling that the crispy mushroom and buffalo burger would supposedly be better

Dumplings - great attempt but if you are used to eating dumplings, you won't be impressed or wowed but there is nothing wrong with them at all.

Meatballs pasta - Amazing sauce, pasta is okay, unfortunately the meatballs were too salty.","the food is great, the atmosphere in the restaurent is nice and the location is perfect( between all major surf spot in the Bukit!). I think it's the only full vegan in the Bukit! I was pleased to see more items on the menu and it tasted really good and fresh! the desert was perfect also! thank you","Even i am not vegan but this place is really good, everything is homemade and staff is lovely. Raw Vegan Cheesecake was literally amazing. Thank u guys i definitely ll be back"

Service of the employees are bad, pretending not seeing the customer when we needed, less attention, waiting too long for just 2 portions of crispy pork even not so busy.
Not worthy compare with the price and what will you got.","Ordered pad thai and crispy pork.

I gave 2.5 stars for the cripsy pork because it was plain, no seasoning at all, well they gave us sauce but come on!
Also I was skeptical if it was undercooked because the fat was not so juicy.
Go find some other place for this one!

For the pad thai, ok lah, around 3.5 I could say.","Food was terrible. The lemon fish was not fresh and the vegetable pork was tasteles. During my meal, there‚Äôs two staff were physically in a fight at the dinning area infront of guest. Lots of yelling and It was scary! So terrible! Will never ever reuturn to this place.",Let me save you some money. Dont bother with the green curry & grilled chicken. it was 90% runny sauce with 3 pieces of chicken. The grilled chicken was so dry couldn‚Äôt eat it. That chicken died in vain. The padang chicken was very tasty though,"We tried 2 Thai restaurants and this is much better and taste is much more authentic. We had tom yum, papaya salad and prawn woon sen (vermicelli). Apart from the prawn woon sen, the other two dishes were similar to authentic Thai taste, but not quite as spicy. Service was very good, thoughtful and friendly. They brought us an extra chair to put our belongings."
