Every single staff member is always smiling and willing to help. Their service level is really high, and I felt true hospitality. Additionally, the beach is easily accessible, and the overall facilities, including the gym, pools, and garden, are well-maintained. The desserts and bakery are their strongest points, and I used almost every restaurant, and their level was great.

Cons:
BB: The vegetable and fruit menus are limited and not of great quality.
Location: It is not easy to get to this hotel. You need to get a private driver or taxi for an extra fee. Since it is isolated, I needed to get a taxi even to go to the supermarket or convenience store.
Restaurants: The overall quality of the restaurants was good, but they were really expensive compared to even fancy restaurants in the Nusa Dua area. There were no options for local food, and since it is isolated, there was no choice but to spend a lot of money.
- No activities to enjoy local culture.

P.S. During the morning yoga class, the lady beside me filmed it, but no one stopped her. It was really uncomfortable. Doing yoga in the morning is to enjoy a relaxing and calm moment, but it made me very uncomfortable and worried about my face being exposed.","‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Mulia Resort Nusa Dua truly lives up to its name, offering a luxurious and unforgettable experience. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by the warm and friendly staff who went above and beyond to make our stay exceptional.

The resort‚Äôs pools are nothing short of stunning. Each pool is meticulously maintained, with crystal-clear water and breathtaking views. Whether you‚Äôre lounging by the infinity pool overlooking the ocean or enjoying the serene atmosphere of the secluded cabanas by the pool, the ambiance is perfect for relaxation and rejuvenation.

The food at Mulia Resort is impeccable. Each meal was a culinary delight, with a wide variety of options that cater to all tastes. The fresh, local ingredients and creative dishes left us looking forward to each dining experience. Special mention goes to the buffet, which was a highlight of our trip.

The staff at Mulia deserve special recognition. Their friendliness and attentiveness made us feel welcome and well-cared-for throughout our stay. From the concierge to the housekeeping team, every member of the staff contributed to the seamless and enjoyable experience.

In conclusion, Mulia Resort exceeded our expectations in every way. With its stunning pools, impeccable food, and incredibly friendly staff, it is the perfect destination for anyone seeking a luxurious and memorable getaway. We can‚Äôt wait to return!","The Mulia Nusa Dua was incredible!
We stayed in the Suites.
The level of customer service is unmatched in regards to other places we have stayed in Bali and other countries.
From beginning to end, our needs were catered to. 2x adults and 1 toddler.
The restaurants had a variety of local, western and international cuisines.
The resort has a variety of pools and is along the beach front. A small taxi ride into the main part of Nusa Dua.
We also had a butler for our room and requests could be phoned through or sent via what‚Äôs app, delivering modern service with ease.
Our room was clean, spacious and the bed was comfortable.
Our room was serviced twice a day, we always had clean towels and bedding.
Every single staff member was polite, accommodating and friendly.
Thank you to the staff who made our holiday truly wonderful! We spent our sons birthday here and he was made to feel special with cake and sang to by the staff.","One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Wonderful, big rooms with private balconies. Excellent breakfast and very good dinner options too. Several pools (with bars!) and a long semi-private beach front. Ultra-friendly service. Really can't fault the Mulia. Not the cheapest, but worth every penny!","Wow, from the moment we walked in, it felt like stepping into a dream! The staff were so friendly and welcoming, making us feel right at home. Our room was super cozy, with the most amazing views. And let's talk about the food ‚Äì absolutely delicious! Every meal was a treat. The team really went out of their way to make our stay special.

We absolutely loved our villa. It was very spacious and luxurious and also spotlessly clean. The private pool was a good size, and the gazebo provided shade. There was also a large garden area with beautiful tropical plants. The service, staff, and restaurants are top rate. I could not fault anything","I stayed for 5 days 4 nights at The Mulia (Earl Suite) and Mulia Villa (Ocean View Villa). Below are some notes I wrote during my stay at Mulia Villa:

Positives:
‚Ä¢ The villa is comfortable and the pool is large. The service is top-notch, with the butler available 24 hours to fulfill our requests (thanks to the butler whom I often troubled).
‚Ä¢ Afternoon tea in the living room was also okay, with friendly servers.
‚Ä¢ Cleaning service, in-room dining, and receptionist are very friendly and professional üëçüèº
‚Ä¢ The lobby and the pool (oasis pool) are also very beautiful, although personally I think they are not as great as The Mulia or Mulia Resort.

Negatives/critics:
‚Ä¢ I stayed in the ocean view villa, which was very close to the main road, and I often heard the noise of vehicles during my stay, making the atmosphere less comfortable.
‚Ä¢ The furniture in the room may need to be updated, as some already looked a bit old/worn during my stay.
‚Ä¢ This is the most important thing, when I had breakfast in the living room, the quality/service wasn't as good as in the lounge at The Mulia. For example, I always ordered ""nasi goreng batavia"" for breakfast, and in the lounge, I always got satay with peanut sauce, while in the living room, the satay with the nasi goreng was plain, without any seasoning. The second thing, when I ordered an iced coffee in the lounge, I was immediately given liquid sugar without having to ask, whereas in the living room, it was not provided and I had to ask the server. Overall, everything is good and okay, but in my opinion, all the services/quality should be consistent in every place (Villa, The Mulia & Resort).

Conclusion: soooooo good and almost perfect! I recommend it for everyone who wants to stay in a villa in Bali! It‚Äôs worth the money üëçüèºüôÇ","We absolutely loved staying at Mulia Villas! I have to say that reading the reviews I thought it‚Äôs too good to be true. But let me tell you: it‚Äôs all true! This place here is absolutely lovely! The villas, the pool, the terrace area, the service, the food, the outdoor shower‚Ä¶ I could go on and it‚Äôs all perfect! We enjoyed breakfast at the living room the most and had most of our included afternoon tea at the living room too which was all delicious. We can highly recommend coming here and just enjoying life. If there was one thing that we didn‚Äôt like, it was that while prices for the restaurants and room service were very reasonable, the spa prices were a bit over the top in my opinion but we just didn‚Äôt use it. So it didn‚Äôt have an effect in the end.","The best experience ever! Service was outstanding from all the staff. The quality of the food was excellent, and the variety of food was pervasive.","We love our stay at Mulia Villa, with private pool in the villa, you have plenty of room to host a party! Their service is world class, you have everything you need to pampering yourself with loved ones for any special occasion! We will come back for sure!"

The spacious villas boast a generously sized bedroom, a nice bathroom complete with a relaxing bathtub, a sprawling pool, and a charming garden featuring a bale bale and a comfortable day bed.

What truly sets The Bale apart is its impeccable service. The personnel is very friendly but also goes above and beyond to ensure a memorable stay. The breakfast was also excellent.

The general manager played a pivotal role in ensuring our stay was nothing short of excellent. Its assistance and personalized touch added an extra layer of warmth to the hospitality.

Upon exploring the set menu, I noticed a slight disproportion in portion sizes. The potatoes and rice were generously served, while the meat portions seemed modest. I couldn't discern the specific type of beef used, though it didn't seem to match the caliber of wagyu or usda prime. At a price point of $100 per head, I encountered some difficulties justifying the overall value.",Had dinner here as a part of my Mulia accommodation package instead of at the Cafe. Great food and atmosphere. Food from the wok live station were top quality. Prefer table 8 to the cafe.,"Despite the staff recommending their buffet, I went for the A La Carte menu because I wanted to try out some different dishes. It definitely did not disappoint as the few dishes picked all tasted very authentic. The steamed fish fillets were great but could have been more generous with the Chinese ham for a stronger taste.","Just go here. I read the google reviews here before deciding to eat at table8, and saw how one guy said this was the best Chinese food he‚Äôs ever had and just rolled my eyes ‚Äî but he was right. SO RIGHT. This place does ALL the flavors spot on, amazing preparation, taste and quality. You can choose between buffet and a la carte, just do the buffet so you can try a little of everything.

Not to miss:
‚Äî-Black pepper prawn clay pot with vermicelli (the flavor in this is unreal, with the way the sauce caramelizes on the side of the clay pot)
‚Äî-Soup with rice noodles (the broth - absolutely amazing with a rich complex flavor, I had a discussion with the chef about it after because I want to try to imitate it at home, it‚Äôs that good üòÜ)
‚Äî-white (creamy bean? Filling?) bun that was just divine, perfectly soft and fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness

Service is also amazing here, super attentive and everyone is the nicest. We were not even staying at the mulia but felt it was 100% worth coming over here to dine at this restaurant. American Chinese food is now ruined for me but it‚Äôs worth it to experience the deliciousness of this place. 10/10.","Perhaps the best Chinese meal I had, ever. We had an a la carte dinner and literally everything we order was beyond excellent. The dishes tasted perfectly balanced with quality ingredients. The prices on the menu were very much well worth it.

I recommend pistachio croissant and coffee bean cake.,"Was very curious about this new place in Nusa Dua, read somewhere and it said to be one of the most luxurious bakeries in Bali and... i think i couldn't agree more. The ambience is very lux and all the pastries are so delicious even though a bit on the pricey side but i'd say it's worth it! The shop has all from coffee, cakes, breads, the famous cromboloni, ice creams, savoury menu and more.

Only about 8-10 people in there. Drinks, and tapas were great though. DJ was playing dance mixes, so if you're into that, you'd have a great time. As always with the Mulia, service was top notch.","Terrible customer service, simply not interested in hearing the customer requests. I had to ask for the manager to get anywhere... he was nice, but what an unpleasant experience. All the other bars at the Mulia were amazing. What‚Äôs wrong with ZJ‚Äôs? Maybe that‚Äôs the reason there‚Äôs only 5 people here at midnight on a Saturday night. What a shame... it‚Äôs a great venue.",Empty on Saturday night. Looks ok. If you come during happy hour prices are ok :),Amazing customer service. Very impressive venue. It wasn't very busy on Monday so going back on Saturday. Drinks are more than in your local restaurant. Happy hour makes the prices a bit better.,Staff were very rude and sub par for this type of establishment. So dead on a Saturday night maybe 7 people in there despite blaring music.
