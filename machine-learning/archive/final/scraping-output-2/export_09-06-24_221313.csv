ChIJkXU7Pktv0S0RTTOACBzjQMA,Beach Villa Ayu,-8.1265374,114.61926890000001,"Jalan BD. Pegametan, Sumberkima, Kec. Gerokgak, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81155, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=13853322163332854605,OPERATIONAL,,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.8,33,,"Yvon and Ayu were great hosts; they made sure our inquiries were delivered promptly. Yvon was very responsive to all of my questions and hesitations before booking the place, and Ayu was the perfect match for her. As a host who greets you in person, she was willing to accommodate our late checkout at 11 pm without any hesitation. She also helped with our needs promptly. The place is meticulously built and beautifully decorated, with all facilities in good condition and working fine. All rooms have the same mezzanine style with a low ceiling.

However, we encountered several issues that we hope do not affect others' judgment. I want to clarify these for future guests so they can prepare in advance. Whether it's a beachfront villa, the beach itself is not ideal for swimming. Located in the fisherman village, the beach is often crowded with fisherman boats and is quite dirty. If you are bringing your own vehicle, please consider visiting Pemuteran beach instead, which is only a few minutes away. Despite having the whole place to yourself, the low front wall with semi-open space means that passersby can easily see inside. But worry not! They have addressed this by installing vertical drop awnings to provide extra privacy.

The mosquito issue is quite annoying, especially in the middle room. The door to the bathroom is no longer tight, so mosquitoes can easily enter the room. Even with the room cooled with air conditioning, they will still attack you mercilessly.
We appreciate their effort in placing so many mosquito repellents of various kinds and electric rackets throughout their place. it is really helpful!","Nestled in a local friendly fishermen's village, this villa has everything you need. Even though there is no restaurants within walking distance, the kitchen is complete, and we enjoyed cooking everything on our own. We ate lots of freshly caught grilled fish for lunch and dinner! The rooms are very well designed and comfortable. It's a perfect setup for a family trip. Ayu and her family are very helpful and made sure our stay is enjoyable. Two nights here felt so short!","Such a lovely villa makes my trip at Bali so unforgettable. üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ We enjoyed a a great evening with grilled fish, beers and music. Watching the sunrise kayaking in the morning is also very exciting. It is very close to the diving spots as well. Even if you don't do anything, it's relaxing to sit on the sofa and listen to the sound of the waves in a lazy afternoon.‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è","Ibu Ayu is such a sweetheart. She goes above and beyond and took such a massive amount of time out of her day to help me with her doctor services when I had a bit of an accident. Definitely would recommend kayaking to the shoals a couple of hundred meters across from Villa Ayu. The Villa is very, very well designed. The exterior area is such a joy to be in and had such good atmosphere. I was impressed by the design and execution in concrete and local hard wood. The rooms are compact but arranged very smartly so you have everything you need. 10/10 would stay again. Thanks all!","We had a fantastic 2 nights stay at Villa Ayu. Situated close to the Taman National Bali Barat and Menjangan Island. A very nice change from the busy locations.
We had 2 rooms for a family of 4 (kids 7 and 10). The new villa is very nicely decorated. Fully equipped with a dining area, BBQ and large sofa‚Äôs and directly to the beach so you can enjoy an impressive sunrise view. The host Ms Ayu was very kind and helpful.
The villa is located in a fishermen‚Äôs village/street. The interaction with the local community makes it unique. Bear in mind it is a bit remote. So if you want to go out you will need a scooter or Ms Ayu can arrange a driver.
She also organised some day trips for us: snorkelling near Menjangan and a sunset boat trip to Gili Putih with a local fisherman. A local fish on the BBQ, rice and arak made the day and our stay complete."
