We came to visit the temple but unfortunately when arriving the weather changed and it was cloudy and rainy . Looking for a place to stay we encountered this place . It is exactly as the pictures published by the accommodation.

Beautiful views and specially sunset is amazing.

The bathroom is with full windows so you can enjoy the view from the bath.

The owner and his family are super friendly and helpful , a real homey feeling .  We had a good rest .

Thanks again and definitely a recommendation!","We had a really comfortable, relaxed, and wonderful stay at La Montaña. The room was very clean and spacious, especially the bathroom. The balcony area outside of the room was also very nice. Breakfast was delicious, and the views were wonderful, especially for sunset. Ketut was incredibly kind and helpful, and we really appreciated that he was available to help us with anything we needed, including arranging a ride for us, cooking some food we had with us, and giving recommendations.","With unbroken mountain views all the way down to the coast dozens of kilometres away and perched above  handful of waterfalls literally only 5-7 minutes away I couldn't have been more pleased. Bapak was amazingly accommodating and beyond helpful in everyway. The home is spectacular and is still a family home surrounded by working mountain garden (vanilla, cloves, cinnamon etc). Tours and pick-up from airport are also available, in fact nearly anything you need or would like will be made available for you.","La Montaña..home stay with a wonderfull view, 2 kms to the lake and junggle..2 kms to munduk waterfall","Good view,,,in the afternoon,,,and recommended if you have holiday in nort bali"

Its really set on the side of the hill and overlooks the valley. You will see the town of Gobleg, the sea and some mountains in Java on a clear day. The sunset is gorgeous, the sun sets in the horizon with the its reflection gleaming off the Ocean's surface. At night, you will see the lights from the town in the distance but the best part is, you can see the milky way too. It's chilly in the night but there is a thick blanket provided. The waterfalls are also really close by. The room is decent, with a water kettle, coffee mugs and packet coffee. The bed is really comfortable, the shower is hot, the breakfast is good but simple. You can get cinnamon tea on request. For dinner, you'd need to drive/ride into town or get them to cook for you. Putu and Komang were amazing. They were our highlight of the stay. I was locked out of my bike and Putu did all he can to help. Komang cooked  a dinner for us. They are lovely lovely people and can speak a little bit of English.  Please note, that this place is really really out of the way so convenient shops are either a trek up or down the hill. You'd need a motorbike to get around. The drive there is gorgeous. This is really a great, secluded place for those who seek peace and quiet. Thank you Putu and Komang! We loved it!",Good hotel with nice view and friendly staff.,Nice view,Glorious and welcoming.,
