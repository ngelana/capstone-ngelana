Less than 1 year old, such a well designed purpose built site.
Excellent bedding and such a comfortable mattress.
Exceptional clean room. With only the slightly grubby shower room and toilet let down.
Both management and staff we found professional, helpful and genuinely welcoming.
Superb location if wishing to visit the many attractions South of there. Only 15 minutes to the nearest large market town to the West. And around 30 minutes to Kota Singaraja.
Summary : Highly recommended.

Post COVID:

With all  understanding of how the hospitality industry has gone through (and still is), De Loran has done it's best to keep up standards.
Although the bathrooms are in need of maintenance. Although there's no hot water in the mornings. Although various room fixtures and fittings don't work. I can still say at the prices (around IRp 130,000 at the time of writing this), the hotel is still a good alternative to renting a small, but expensive villa in the same area.",Pretty good place to stay. The most important for me is it's quiet enough so I don't hear much from the road nor neighborhood. It's clean and nice for the price. Wifi is very good. There's no bathtub tho.,"The room is nice and clean although the water coming from the shower is a bit smelly, you should pay cash basis only because there is no Bank editions therefore get ready with cash","The best value of this hotel is the staff. So friendly and going out of their way to help you with everything.
I stayed for 4 nights and the manager was afraid for me because I was alone, and he didn‚Äôt want me to be tricked by local sales people.",It is just a low price  acomodation with average service if we cant rate it low.. no other service provided neither food. Room is clean and hotel aeea well maintained.
