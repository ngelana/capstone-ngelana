ChIJeb2hJTQb0i0R8cEn-DXrHUs,Goa Giri Campuhan waterfall,-8.4639252,115.3886583,"G9PQ+CFF, Nyanglan, Tembuku, Bangli Regency, Bali, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=5412740944198353393,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.9,17,,As of early September the waterfall is almost empty! Itâ€™s a bit of a walk in dry rice fields and then down steep steps and finally a dark cave. No entrance fee as there are no tourists. Goa Raja was much better!,Absolutely stunning walk to get to the waterfalls. Great pools for swimming with crystal clear water.,We come here to climb up the falls and explore further into the forest to see what's around the corner. It's a fun little spot.,Amazing waterfall,good places
