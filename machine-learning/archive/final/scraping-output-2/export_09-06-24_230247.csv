Kintamani, Kabupaten Bangli, Bali 80652, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=4317479901829198328,OPERATIONAL,+62 857-3868-6813,,lodging,4.6,19,,Hands down the best place in Bali! beautifully located and decorated with much love for the details. Outside bathroom and stunning looks from the masterbedrooms. Looks better than in the pictures! Bobby is a great host an morning Yoga was amazing! Food prepared by Dinas Warung brought to the house was delicious! We'll come back :),"Really great place! Previous review is really wrong. The house looks exactly like in the photos. Stuuf - especially Booby is great! The view from like each room is mind blowing! It has it's own fireplace! And it's great to stay here no matter the weather is. So I really hope that previous review didn't confuse you, like it almost confused me! Just see the reviews in Airbnb)","Word of warning, this place is NOT as truly advertised as the photos. Very much a catfish situation. The photos published are of when the house was first built. As of now it is vey run down and in much need of TLC. It is charming with a great view, but that is as far as far as it goes.

Bobby was very nice and accommodating. I wish the same could be said about Elle.

If you are renting this house please be aware that the second smaller “Earth home” is basically just a shack with an outdoor bathroom. Very basic level of accommodation. The main house has nice touches, but nothing as breathtaking as the photos would lead you to believe. The only real things that were the saving grace of the whole experience was the upstairs outdoor bathroom, flower of life mosaic on the living room floor, fireplace (because there is no other form of heating) & the mountain side view.

Not the best value for money, but not the worst. The photos should be updated to show the current state of the place. When I got there I was incredibly disappointed. It is in a super remote location so I didn’t have much choice but to stay there and on such short notice could not book another place. If this I knew the house was in the current state it is, I probably would not have booked it to begin with.

Additionally the WiFi consists of only 1 small portable hotspot that can’t work for both homes.

I didn’t want to write this type of review but I was left with no choice after I was left feeling incredibly mislead.",We were only here for drinking beer. The owners are really friendly.,You should stay here minimum 3 nights. This place is perfect. The view is wonderful. If you want a relaxed holiday you should stay here
