Not a single soul on the beach, although i passed alot of tourists. I am guessing most people turn around.

I was there at low tide and there was no current,  so i just floated around in knee deep water.","What an amazing quiet place.
The access is so hard by motorbike... be careful !  but the way is really nice. People who met were so smiling and welcoming.
The sea was clear. The beach is ok when the tide is down. The beach is so dirty with plastic everywhere. But we are all responsible of that.
We were alone! And we knew why ahah","Be warned! This route is not for bike riders.. But the view in the end is unique and breathtaking.. This is not Atuh Beach;but Google maps takes us here if we navigate to Atuh Beach.. The last 2 KMs is best walked.. We took the bike and we were lucky to come back without any mishaps.

Take lots of water.. Not a single shop for refreshments..","This is one of my favorite hidden beach at Nusa Penida. The road is terrible,  but after that the beach is only for u. It is little bit difficult to swim but still is is possible.","Beautiful beach, But the road is very bumpy and can be challenging especially if you're not an experienced rider. You can end up falling, flat tire, damaging  your motorbike.Skip this beach there'r plenty of other beautiful beaches"

Do not go there alone or if you not experienced rider. You can easily fall, damage your motorbike or finish with flat tire.
The place is very beautiful, nusa penida had other beautiful beaches around, so you can skip it",,,,
