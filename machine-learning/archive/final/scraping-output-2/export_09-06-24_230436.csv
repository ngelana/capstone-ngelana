Such a peaceful beautiful space with the tables overlooking the rice fields. The food was good and the staff was super friendly. Also if you are an animal lover, they have the sweetest dog and cat.","Nice place to make a long stop while on the road. Tasty fried rice, coffee and a good rest (you can lay down and relax on ""dastrakhan"") you a shade - that's the thing you need on journey.
Prices are affordable - rice for 25k.
People here speak English and have English menu.
And really nice view by the way",Nice place fresh air green panorama.,"Really nice people, great seating with beautiful view to rice fields. The food was delicious. During waiting the owner was so nice, that he showed us his garden.","Friendly owner, restaurant has great views. Food is ok in my opinion nothing special. What I can recommend is Rujak Buah (sweet and spicy fruit salad).
Prices are a bit higher than normal warungs but location and especially the views are worth it imo."

Cute little warung with a gorgeous view of rice fields.

Food is delicious and not expensive.

Staff are friendly and very welcoming.

It also has a swimming pool which is a bit out of ordinary for a street side warung.

It is a little noisy from the traffic and parking is road side only.","Best place to refill yourself after a long trip.
