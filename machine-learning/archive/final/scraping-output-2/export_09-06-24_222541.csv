Unfortunately it needed a bit of maintenance at the time. Roof leaking, mold on the walls.
The villa is only conditionally suitable for a baby, next to the villa is a river / stream the access is not secured, when it has rained, this washes garbage to the coast.
Unfortunately we 1.5 year old baby and an adult got sick in the villa. (Campylobacter, Norovirus and EPEC) The exact reason is not clear, food, water quality... the remaining days in Bali were of course anything but relaxing.
It was our second visit to Bali and we have traveled a lot around the world, but nothing like this has happened to us before.","Be aware this house is very remote. The house staff is excellent but they cannot fix the fact that you are hours away from anything. If that is what you want then this place is exactly what you need.
