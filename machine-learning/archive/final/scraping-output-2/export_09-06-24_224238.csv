Maybe we aren't the people it's aimed at, but if you really want to find out for yourself, then go visit.
20/30 minute walk from the main road down to the accommodation, cars won't drive down there.
Flies all over the accommodation, hundreds of them.
If you can't ride a motorbike/scooter, you will be stuck at the accommodation.
Room was literally just a mattress, nowhere to put bags or to get changed.
Rooms were damp so girlfriend got ill.
The caretakers living on site were really nice though so nothing against them.
We visited in February so maybe the place isn't ready for travellers that time of year.","If I could put 0 stars I would. We didn’t even get to stay at the property because of false advertisement in the description. For some people it will be ok, but if you are travelling around and have a lot of luggage you can’t stay here, or you have to be parted with your things. We contacted the host and they were extremely rude to us, claiming we were bullying them for simply stating that we did not know that we couldn’t stay here if we had lots of luggage. They will only be professional with you if you have no problems and furthermore they cannot take any criticism even if it’s just you saying your queries. You can see this by scrolling through their replies to reviews, and reviews about them as guests. Definitely would not recommend. Many other comments mention the property is not like the online listing as well. Just be careful with this one.","Beautiful views and friendly locals.
We stayed one night in this place and loved it!
It is rustic, as you can see on the pictures.
This is not for the suitcase type of traveller (the suitcase won’t even fit in your cabin ;)
But.. if you are someone who likes a bit of an adventure (the road on a motorcycle) and don’t need luxury then this place is right for you!
The views of the sunset are amazing and the sound of the jungle will put you to the perfect sleep.

There is a small menu for food to choose from which will be made by the locals who run the place. Again, nothing fancy but just right.
Besides, it will be hard to leave the place and get back in the dark. (Won’t recommend due to the road)

Google maps shows the right location and you can best arrive by motorbike.

Waterfalls are close by and worth the adventure!

And if your lucky you can watch lightning strikes in the distance:)

Long story short: if you like adventure, awesome views & are not picky about where you rest your head then this place is amazing!!
the views from the pool makes you feel like a million bucks!","Magic little gem. Beautiful hosts and beautiful, rustic spot. There is only one shared bathroom for all guests. It’s an outside inside shower and I just loved my stay here! Would go back in a heartbeat. Full submersion in nature.","At $30 a night (Airbnb)  this is a rip off.
There's NO tree house, only a dusty cabin with a detached bathroom and toilet.
The mattress is like 30 years old. It's terrible. No, TERRIBLE.
There is NOISE. Dogs were barking hard right next to the cabin. The cabin has no real walls, so you hear it pretty well. Insects or rats whatsoever were making noise scraping the wood right above the bed.
I came to have a good sleep in fresh air and I found no sleep here. This place sucks.
And there's even no breakfast included!

PS no network coverage, and their wifi is super slow.
PPS there's no waterfall"
