The location is convenient if you are near Ubud. It is far away from other locations.
The forest and jungle are beautiful.
Bad thing, I was at 933 room, and it was noisy due to staff moved furniture. Even though I called the reception, they didn't stop until 11:45 pm. It happened twice on the 2nd and 3rd of April.
I recommend the breakfast continental, American, and Balinese breakfast.
The afternoon tea was nice.
Thanks, staff. You are awesome","Was looking for an inexpensive place to chill near the tegalalang rice terraces and found this place. DO NOT MISS IT!
Food was amazing and cheaply priced, no entrance fee or minimum spend and you can take all the time you want in their lovely infinity pool. Staff is super friendly and available. Truly a gem of a place.","This resort was the highlight of my trip. It exceeded my expectations in terms of serenity, comfort, and privacy amidst nature. Rooms facing the valley were a delight. I extended my stay by two more nights as this is what I hoped for when I came to Ubud to enjoy and be in nature. The service was fantastic as well. Resort is quite close to Cretya, and the tirthan temple too.","Room : good
Service: good
Location: Entrance gate a little small with 1 car size width. Need to slow down to look for it. It’s in the middle of mountain road. You need a transportation to go around.
