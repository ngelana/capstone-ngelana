Good food, good prices and they do all the dishes well.

I stayed there for three nights and I have to say, everything you need you will find there. Own kitchen, sofa, outdoor gym, pool and relaxing area.

Very close to the beach (only 3 minutes by scooter), restaurants and cafes close to it (2-3 minutes by scooter). Beautiful landscape in the middle of rice paddies. No noise, only nature!","the closet is dirty, flush it 3 times and still dirty!
(i havent used it yet )

the people dont respond fast despite this bad condition.","Nice kitchen, surrounded by beautiful nature","**Perfect Combination of Work and Relaxation**

As a DJ and artist, I travel a lot, and Bali, Indonesia, is an ideal island to unwind. I was looking for accommodation that would allow me to combine my DJ life in Indonesia or Bali with peace and my remote work on the computer. So, I searched for a location a bit away from the excessive traffic of Canggu and found these Tiny Houses.

At first, I was skeptical about whether the Tiny Houses would be too small for me, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well-designed everything was and how much luggage could be stored. Each location has its own working desk that can be easily unfolded, so you can conveniently store your laptop, light, microphones, etc. The internet, provided by Global Extreme, is one of the strongest networks in Indonesia and was surprisingly stable and fast. This allowed me to work remotely with my international clients without any issues, and I felt like a digital nomad.

If you need peace but still want to plan great day trips to Ubud, Uluwatu, Seminyak, or Canggu, this is the perfect central location. At night, you enjoy the tranquility ‚Äì no loud motorcycles, no party noise, just the chirping of crickets in a small house surrounded by rice fields. The view of the sunset is simply breathtaking. You can take small walks outside, relax briefly between work sessions, and then return to your desk fully focused to continue your projects.

I really enjoyed staying in this Tiny House. Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to use the great open-air gym, which is included for free. I can imagine it being an absolute blessing to get up in the morning and do your workout directly without having to go to a crowded gym. The owners also told me they have a freezer for ice baths, which I didn‚Äôt use either. That‚Äôs something for next time.

Thank you for the friendly support and the pleasant stay. I will definitely come back.","Great Place - tidy place! Excellent kitchen equipment better than in most places.
Calm and relaxing location. Owners availability was great - had a good time there!"
