A wonderful golf course.  One of the most beautiful in Bali.  2 restaurants.    Good food.  Attentive staff.  I recommend staying overnight and choosing a room with a fireplace","This resort is amazing! Me and my family very enjoyed our stay here. Imagine playing tennis and golf with this beautiful and fresh view. All the staff are wonderful, the service is great!   Will come back again definitely!","Beautiful experience. It was a late check-in because the room wasn‚Äôt ready. But they made it up to us by giving us free archery lessons and complimentary cookies.
The rooms was nice. The service excellent. The location was peaceful.",Very posh place full of expats. We just stopped by the restaurant to eat. The view was overlooking the golf course. Fantastic view of the mountain ranges as well surrounding Bali. The food was superb as well. I ordered the grilled dory fish. I wish we could have spent more time here and took some photos but it started to rain. Looked really high end and expensive.,"2 years ago I stayed in this resort, was pleasant stay. I play golf few times as well. Recently  ( last Saturday 27 April 2024 ) I played 18 holes with 3 friends ( so 4 of us ), tee off before 10am. The course looks fresh new and nice !! The problem is the Marshal ( Budiani ) was not organize the players well. Total messed. We let 1 group went first ( 3 people ) because marshal asked, we are ok assuming they will play better than us, but unfortunately ‚Ä¶. Was not better than us. Second we let one single player pass us because he was alone, no problem. BUT‚Ä¶.the marshal asked another group to pass‚Ä¶like seriously? We were nice and let the single player went first because he was alone and group of 3 with not so good, and she asked for another group ? That was really ruined our mood. Please do something with her..she was not really nice to us :("

Just one example: the cabbage rolls are not rolls at all, it‚Äôs just fibrous pieces of cabbage in liquid tomato sauce I immediately regretted eating it and got heartburn after 5 minutes. Lots of flies, what is the problem with buying ultraviolet fly lamps, which are used throughout Asia? The restaurant is full of tourists and this kind of management and cooking is a shame.","Food is fine,don‚Äôt expect big portions. Price is okay for the view u get,incredibly good!
I like cacao with rum,never tried it before and I like it.","The ambient and the view are really good. If you are Muslim, they provide place to do prayer.

Ordered:
- Bebek Betutu: the flavour of the sauce is really good, bold and balance.
- Fish and Chips: the portion is fulfilling. The sauce is good, unfortunately they give it only small amount. The fish tastes fresh and not fishy.
- Ayam Penyet: The ""sambal"" is really spicy, definitely Indonesian ""sambal"". If you can't tolerate spiciness, don't order this.
- Tempe mendoan: crispy and tasty.","Nice place and view, the food was good especially the Thai beef salad.
But the server was terrible, not polite as a resort hotel standard with 21% tax and service.
The manager need to do lot of training program for the staff, especially for the tall waitress.
There were lots of flies in the restaurant making it uncomfortable to enjoy the food.","Beautiful view, wealthy atmosphere! We took fried chicken starter and chicken curled with mashed potato- it was fantastic. Prices are like in big Balinese cities."
