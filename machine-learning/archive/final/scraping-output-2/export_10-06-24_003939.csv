The personnel really went above and above to make us feel welcome. The meal at The River Cafe was excellent, and the scenery was breathtaking. The stunning scenery and first-rate service of the resort created an experience we will never forget. Strongly advised for families looking for luxury and leisure!","Maya Ubud Spa and resort is a tranquil place amidst pristine forest, flowing rivers, long walks alongside lush green lawns and beautifully thatched roofs. With a private pool  in the villa it makes for a perfect destination. The people there are very friendly and warm. The massage at the spa is sure to relax your  nerves after a long flight. For pure vegetarians food is always a concern... But juicy fruits are always at the rescue. It's a must visit for a very relaxing stay when you are at ubud.","Absolutely incredible hotel, the views are extraordinary and the service and staff are so much better. Everyone is super friendly and welcoming. The villa with pool was fantastic with an incredible view over the rain forest. Monkeys and other wildlife were at our door step. Finally, the food was incredible 5 stars all around.

Yoga and Sadewa at the breakfast were fantastic and made us feel right at home.","We had a fantastic time at this resort. Everything was luxurious and of a high standard. The staff went above and beyond to make sure everything is like to ensure everything is high standard. The place was spotless. The staff were swift to respond to our needs and provided so many excellent services that were fantastic choices for Honey owners. We enjoyed the floating breakfast dinner at the villa. We also had the decoration for the bathtub with flowers, and that was also amazing. Overall, it was perfect, and I highly recommend it to everybody.","I have just returned from Bali, and wished to express positive feedback for Maya resort Ubud. The resort is stunning and elegant. I was delighted with a room upgrade, but more importantly the staff are outstanding. it was my birthday and much to my embarrassment many staff sang happy birthday and presented me with a birthday cake. Thankyou to all the staff which made our visit so special. Management should be proud of their teams effort and attention to gust."

The pool is always fresh and relaxing. I stayed in room 102 the room is leaking from the ceiling for it's bathroom and on top of bathroom door. When I first came in the room was humid and smelled moldy. I would recommend the upstairs room There might be less leaks and mold. Also the road to the hotel still rocky","Avoid this place at all costs. I was really excited to stay here but the photos definitely catfished me. The hotel promised to refund me fully for my stay but have not followed through with this.
Beware that the hotel is down a 400m pitch black ‚Äòroad‚Äô (more like a gravel pathway adjacent to a stream) that a car can barely fit down. There is a building site and a dodgy looking home stay on the same road which makes it feel not safe to walk at night. I‚Äôd hate to stay here as a solo female traveler.

There‚Äôs a dog with fleas (biting its limbs and body) wandering in the lobby, bar, restaurant and playing outside with kids. It barks madly at people when they enter.

Taxi drivers struggle to find the place and you‚Äôll wait long for a gojek.

The walls of the room are paper thin and you can hear noises, such as toilets flushing and singing, above and next door and in the corridor. It feels as though animals and insects are constantly crawling around. The towels were threadbare.

The WiFi was shockingly terrible.","1. The room is spacious, the furniture is great but the air conditioner is misplaced in the room, so you have to wait long time to feel cool in the room, hope there will be a review about it
2. The breakfast is good and enough to start your day
3. The acces to the location is need more attention regarding the light and the street
4. The service is good, the team is very well responding","Very cozy hotel, nice rooms and great service. Swimmin pool also clean and beautiful. Just u have to find it a little bit off the road. Car reaches there. Google does not show but there is a narrow lane. Take scooter from hotel only, dont goto main road by walk after sunset. All in all great experience.","Kandarpa is a really solid hotel in Ubud. The rooms are modern, comfortable and the beds are perfect firmness. The pool is relaxing and right outside your room as all the rooms open right into the courtyard. The lobby/restaurant was a very welcome surprise, good local cuisines that hit the spot and a nice breakfast set menu.

I can‚Äôt say enough nice things about the staff too, always welcoming with a smile and willing to go the extra mile to make your stay better. Great value for a nice vacation!"

We stayed in the premier room with the pool and it was absolutely amazing. Very clean and the bed was comfortable. We have been to Bali many times and this is by far the best place we have stayed, the view and location was our favourite part.

If you have never tried floating breakfast, get this experience at least once. We are definitely considering to come back here for another peaceful weekend!","The Hidden Paradise Ubud is hidden at a quiet place. You can miss this place easily except for a small sign at the entrance which leads to a narrow driveway into the carpark of the hotel.

Because it is hard to find, The Hidden Paradise Ubud is a quiet, romantic, luxury hotel with a great view. For those who value their privacy, this is a great place to stay in. The hotel has a shuttle bus to bring the guests into town for meals, shopping, spas, other activities, etc.

The rooms are great, spacious, clean and you can find an infinity pool outside. Do take note that other guests has access to the infinity pool too and you may find them swimming outside your room. You can use the curtain to block them out of the view of your room.

They do serve dinner and other food too. The traditional balinese food served by the chef is good"

It is a bit away from the centre of Ubud so it is very quiet and peaceful. Yet only a short drive with Grab or Gojek to most of the main points of interests like the market and palace.

The staff are super kind and attentive. Just small things like bringing pool towels when you are swimming in the pool and always greeting you with a smile and letting us feed the fish :)

The breakfast was delicious and they were able to accommodate both dairy and mushroom allergies. They even note these down upon check in.","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Bubu Suite in Ubud, and I must say it was an absolutely fantastic experience. From the moment we arrived to the day of departure, the staff went above and beyond to make our holiday memorable.

One of the highlights of our stay was undoubtedly the impeccable service provided by the hotel staff. Every member of the team was friendly, attentive, and genuinely committed to ensuring our comfort. Their warm hospitality created a welcoming atmosphere, making us feel like valued guests throughout our stay.

Moreover, the overall service at the hotel was exceptional. Whether it was assistance with tour recommendations, transportation arrangements, or any other request, the staff was always prompt and eager to help. Their professionalism and dedication undoubtedly contributed to the overall positive impression of the hotel.

The ambiance and decor of the hotel were also noteworthy, creating a serene and aesthetically pleasing environment that added to the overall charm of our stay.

In conclusion, our time was nothing short of a five-star experience. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing and welcoming retreat in Ubud. The combination of excellent service, delectable breakfast options, and an overall commitment to guest satisfaction makes Bubu Suite stand out as a top-notch accommodation choice in this beautiful destination. I look forward to returning in the future.","Absolutely enjoyed our stay. Rooms are big, well furnished, airy, hardly need AC. Nice pool, beautiful territory.

My only remarks are:
- though technically you're walking distance away from Ubud centre, those 300m till the statue are hardly walkable, so if you don't rent a bike, you'll have to splurge on Grab
- bathroom floor could be cleaner

Otherwise lovely time","If you are looking for a nice, relaxing stay in Ubud, this is your place. The rooms are cozy, clean and with a nice aesthetic.

The service is always friendly and helpful. The only concern we had was the inability to lock the shared room. It would have been great to provide a room key for each of the four beds. This was the reason why we paid extra attention to always lock our things inside the lockers.

Thankyou so so much!","Peaceful low key property with kind hosts and beautiful views.

I came to Bali for 1 month for a yoga  certification and we stayed on this property, did yoga at their yoga shala and ate food here every day.

Pros:
1. Good food. Because of our training, we had breakfast ,  lunch and dinner here. good variety and taste.

2. This is a FAMILY owned and operated property. Adi and her family live on site and are available 24/7 for your needs. We had a yoga member have a health condition during our stay, and Adi arranged everything for us to get to hospital , where to go and what to do. Hardworking kind family.

3. They clean every day. Every day we had our bed made (sheets washed whenever requested too), floors swept and mopped, and bathroom cleaned. I saw them clean and filter pool every morning too.

4. The price! Very reasonable price, especially for long term.

5. The animals! They have the sweetest dog and kitten family on property. Don‚Äôt worry if you aren‚Äôt an animal person, they don‚Äôt bother you at all. But if you are, you can play with them all day. For a whole month I really missed my dog back at home, so I was so grateful for this experience.

6. Laundry options! Very cheap to do laundry , they wash and fold for you , and there is a hand wash option too

7. Yoga shala! Two beautiful yoga shalas available for your own practice and they also offer yoga classes. Surrounded by the jungle, it is so peaceful.

8. Quiet! It‚Äôs very quiet and low key here. Not a lot of traffic or noise. Perfect for your peace.

9. Good WiFi and signal. This was an essential while I needed to work remote.

Cons
1. It is not the MOST updated. But honestly I think that is reflected in the price.

All of the people writing bad reviews must have expected some kind of 5 star hotel. If you are looking for a 5 star hotel experience , then go book something $200+/night.
But if you are looking for a safe, peaceful, traditional Balinese experience, then stay here at Puri Suksma","The most disappointing and disgusting hotel I ever visited.  No one should stay at this property. We pay way higher then what we get and the reception straight refused to give what we booked even we are not happy at all what they offered to us and took all of our money in advance fully in cash.

The room we booked was fully equipped and well furnished. The room we got was completely empty, broken and not clean. No cover on duvet, shower was broken, sink was broken, toilet seat was so so dirty, floor was disgusting, just 2 lights on the roof but very dim . The room as completely abandoned and after saying so many times that the rooms we don‚Äôt like, they just ignored us and we left no option to stay.

Water, slipper, shower gel, everything was missing and we have to ask again and again until it arrived .

At the breakfast our food and drinks just thrown on table and given one piece one bread and one omelette. When we asked for pancakes they said they‚Äôll not give us as we don‚Äôt stay longer !! we booked for 6nights I don‚Äôt know how long they was us to stay just for one pancake ??

The don‚Äôt care about their guests at all and on the first day in the breakfast they already mentioned to us that we should check out at 11am if we are without we even asked.

Took the full money in cash, didn‚Äôt treat us as a guests how it should be taken care and also telling us to leave if we don‚Äôt like so they can sell our room to different people and earn more!! It‚Äôs totally scam and should be closed this property.  They even placed us No show from there systems show we can‚Äôt report after the check out process.  We also have file a complaint in booking (dot)com . But I‚Äôm not sure if they take any action against it.","We lived here for over two months and were satisfied.  The owners are very nice, good people.  The area is spacious and clean.  There is a large swimming pool which is cleaned every day.  The rooms themselves are small but cozy.  A huge plus is that you can order food from the owners, it is very profitable and very tasty.  I recommend to everyone.  If we are in Bali again, we will definitely stay there.","Here‚Äôs to type of room view
- 1st room view with pool
- 2end room view on garden which is very scary ,
So I booked this hotel 4 months ago with the room with view on pool but when I arrived the staff send me to the garden room which is I didn‚Äôt accept to stay there so they called the owner and talked to her actually the owner are very rude and she didn‚Äôt apologize for what happened she just yelled at me and said If you don‚Äôt want cancel!
dirty toilet the smell is really disgusting, no shampoo no soap.
I asked the staff when we can swim because there‚Äôs a constructions on the pool he said probably takes 2 weeks- 1 month"

The restaurant /bar is also very good,we ordered many times there, it‚Äôs top notch food really! You can also ask to have the food at your bungalows or by the pool. The place was cleaned everyday, I definitely recommend it. Location is also very good.
If you are not staying there you can come to enjoy the restaurant and the pool.
Special thanks to the team that was always making sure we are having a perfect stay!","We stayed at Pemulan House for 4 nights. The service was incredible, every meal we had was delicious and overall the ambiance was great. Because it is outside of the city center, it was quiet at night - just the sounds of nature and the occasional rooster. We had no problem walking to the city center.","We stayed at Pemulan House for 3 days and ate regularly at their restaurant. The continental breakfast (with banana pancakes) was amazing! Nice prices too! Really recommend to come here, the staff is very nice and kind. You can even swim in their beautiful pool!","lovely quiet atmosphere & wonderful food - we shared some spring rolls, an aglio pasta & a super tasty chicken soup.

The soft acoustic music was peaceful & pool was a big bonus that we enjoyed dipping our feet in! We‚Äôll definitely be back.

Terima kasih banyak Pemulan ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Despite only staying for 1 night, they made it really comfortable and smooth. The walk to the house was paved well and seeing the rice fields especially in the morning and evening really puts a smile to my face at how serene the place is. Their son, Yana, is a wonderful tour guide and has the best recommendations. They helped to organise an airport pick up and tour for me all in a day. Yana also sent me to my new place the next day. They are all very friendly and approachable. You'll definitely love your stay with them :)","Quite simply the best place I've stayed in Asia.  Its a dramatically beautiful mansion/house set in the ricefields.  Peaceful, quiet like you are in a village but you are actually only a couple minutes from Ubud centre.  Gym right next door, wonderful restaurants a 1min walk.  Super lovely hosts.  Quality treatments at the in-house spa.  Amazing breakfast options.  Madee and his family are just the best of people, generous, decent, reliable.  Pricing is extremely affordable for what it was.","The guest house I stayed at was nothing short of amazing and I cannot speak highly enough of it. Made and Putu were fantastic hosts and were extremely polite and helpful. A five or ten minute walk to the main road, but I wasn't bothered by that. You get to enjoy the view of the rice fields while you're there. There was a clear view of the rice field from my room, which was refreshing in the morning. It's only about a 10 minute ride to Ubud center on gojek, so it's convenient to many places.

Here are some pros:
- My room was spacious and clean, and my host made it up on the 2nd day, which I appreciated
- The air conditioning works great
- The toilets are clean and spacious.
- There's an aqua bottle in the room
- Breakfast can be served for a little fee

Cons of the room (for fussy travellers):
- The wifi connection is intermittent
- I couldn't get hot water for the shower

Thanks to Ajik and Yana for picking me up from the airport and also for taking me to my hotel in Canggu, I especially appreciate it.

Overall, I had a great experience staying at the guest house, and I will definitely recommend it to others and recommend it to friends.","I stayed here for 2,5 month and just as last summer I loved every minute of it! Made, Putu and their children are so kind and helpful üôè It‚Äôs a quiet place with a spa in the garden and plenty of restaurants nearby! You can watch the farmers work their land, witnessed by eagrets and other birds. All in walking distance from Ubud center.","I really loved this place! It's a perfect little retreat away from the busy Ubud centre. Its tucked away amongst the rice fields. The rooms have amazing views of the ricefield too. Very peaceful. The room I had was huge, fit for a queen! It was clean, comfortable & breakfast was brought to my room every morning, which was very simple but oh so tasty. The hosts were very lovely & friendly. I would recommend to bring a torch if planning to go out in the evening, when coming &/or going at night time. I loved it so much I extended my stay."

Now, I understand why it's highly rated.

My spouse and I stayed here for only 2 days because we had already pre-booked a different place, but we wished we had booked longer.

This is truly a hidden gem and worth every penny. Arga and her partner welcomed us at 11:30 pm on the day we arrived and helped us settle in. We received 5-star hotel service at the price of a 3-star accommodation. Arga was always on standby to answer any of our questions, and her team ensured our breakfast and other requests were attended to promptly.

The attention to detail in the place is remarkable; it‚Äôs very zen and relaxing. We will definitely be returning here with other friends.

The villa features a large welcoming room with a kitchen, a master bedroom with two sitting areas, and a spacious shower area with a bathtub. Next door is a similar villa, allowing large families or two couples to book a holiday next to each other.

The privacy in both villas is exceptional; you could even go skinny dipping if you wanted to üòÖ","Staying at this exquisite villa in Ubud was an absolute delight! From the moment we arrived, the warmth of the staff and their exceptional service made us feel right at home. Each morning, we were treated to a breakfast that was not just delicious but a culinary masterpiece‚Äîa perfect start to our days exploring Bali. The villa itself was a serene oasis, beautifully designed and maintained, offering us a peaceful retreat in the heart of Ubud. The hospitality was beyond compare, making our entire stay an unforgettable experience.
I would definitely stay when I come to Bali again and recommend others to choose this villa if coming to Ubud Bali.
Memorable stay","It was most welcoming villa to stay, the owner(Ms Arga and Mr Made) was very accommodating Owner. The hospitality was great. Definitely will come again.","Absolutely amazing place to stay. Very nice and organised host that went above and beyond for our anniversary but organising some amazing surprises. Private pool, cool aircon and comfortable bed are only a small part of how fantastic it was. Thankyou.","Great Experienced to stay in Sawitri Luxury Villas üòò

The food is okay, but worth it to see the views here. Honestly one of the most beautiful hotels I‚Äôve ever seen. They also have great spa treatments. Their flower baths have a view of the river! You can also walk out back and see a beautiful rice field.  At nights they have a band playing in the dining area.  Greta place for a date.","This is the secondary dining option at the hotel, the drinks terrace seating is lovely as are the tables overlooking the valley. The sangria here is singular, very tasty and rich. Though everything was tasty and the portions were not small, the flavors are very good but not out of this world.

The service was prompt and the atmosphere is calm, tables well spaced.

We had the beetroot salad, smash burger and the spring rolls. Everything was tasty and filling; a nice place with varied, tasty food options.","Once I had been coming here several times a month (before the pandemic), then I had to move back to Europe and recently I came back after nearly three years of break. The place is wonderful, looks great. The coffee is very tasty, the food is really yummy, drinks and serving look great. I'd come here to eat more often if I didnt live over an hour drive away. The only down side is that many of the staff seem to have trouble communicating in English, although on one hand it is Indonesia and they have their own language, but on the other hand it is an international establishment so it is well expected that guests won't know local language. Am I right?","I really enjoyed my dining experience here - the food was very good but even better was the friendly service from: Arsana, Ayu, Dek Rika, Mely, and Sanji.  Thank you team for being so helpful and friendly","This is a really nice place to have a drink or eat , the view is amazing, Parka and Dewi are some really good guests!!"
