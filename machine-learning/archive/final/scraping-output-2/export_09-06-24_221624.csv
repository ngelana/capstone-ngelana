Quiet at night, breakfast was also very good. The staff is helping too book tours for diving and to the national park.","Beautiful homestay in a green peaceful village close to the beach & hills. With friendly Balinese staff & its peacefulness, you'll think about staying longer here. Would love to come back someday.","Very good place with a nice garden. The room are very clean and confortable, with a nice outdoor bathroom ! I enjoyed my stay here.","This is a what you pay for and what you get type of situation. Bed sheets and towels have some iffy colour. Floor was all wet when I checked in. The girl was very nice and told me to hop on the bed and then moped off my foot print, but that still didn't solve the floor being wet problem. The tap was dripping non stop. The outdoor shower only has cold water. Not a big deal, but I was diving at night. The electricity stopped twice for the two nights I was there. Laundry is $25k/kg. I had a small bag of clothes with two denim shorts, cost me $50k. Medium sized gecko as my roommate. Breakfast $25k, omelette was overcooked.

I think this is a great value stay especially for my own private room, would definitely consider booking again if I'm backpacking on a budget. The owner was helpful. I just thought some of the reviews seem a little hyped up, so here's some more info.","Good price and confortable stay.
Staff is lovely, gardens are beautiful. Not far from the beach and restaurants.
The place is so quiet ! Had a great and peaceful sleep with nothing to wake me up ! I would definitely come back !"

Initially, we came for a quick bite for dinner, but ended up visiting Kadek Merry three more times the following two days. The service is friendly, warm and welcoming and the (fish)dishes, chicken and lemongrass soup as well as the vegetarian curry dish are absolutely to die for 🤤
With this area along the north coast being susceptible to low tourism during winter season, it’s crucial to support with tips and writing recommendations. This place deserves to be packed every night 🤩","My favourite place in Permuteran for dinner! Delicious vegan food utilising a large variety of herbs and vegetables. The vegan dishes are all fragrant and nicely thought out, and not an afterthought where the same dish is made but just without the meat. We enjoyed the green curry, the gado gado, the Lao style laab dishes and the Vegan Pepes.","Really great food, the chicken sweet & sour and the apple crumble dessert are big recommendations. It's not located on a big street, but these are usually the best finds!","Amazing food - best food in Bali!

Recommend: Ikan Kohu-Kohu, Pepe’s Ikan and fresh grilled fish! Also the cocktails are good.","The best, we had lunch and dinner every day . So tasty , full of flavours and so fresh . Everything was amazing and really affordable ."

Enjoyed immensely the walk through the micro farm out the back. I wish you all the best with a successful Vanilla Bean harvest Koman. 😀 Oh and the rooms are so comfy.,"We stayed two nights at this lovely and nice Homestay. There were ten units each quite large with beautiful bathrooms eith lovely showers. Komang the owner told us all the local Temples and other attractions.
Some great restersunts a 5 minute walk away.
Komang and his family has a small farm behind the wall of the units. Raising Vanilla, Citrus, cassava  and pigs. Maybe Farm to plate in the future. Lovely helpful people with nice separate lodging. Air conditioning work great. Very affordable. Best room for price on 1 month Motor bike trip. Safe under cover place for motor bike.
I will go back again for sure.","We received such a warm welcome here, Komang was super-friendly and accommodating, and really interesting to talk to. The rooms were beautiful with mosquito net, set in a lush little garden. Highly recommended!","You get what you pay for which is just shy of the essentials. The bed is pretty basic. The shower, toilet and sink are old and dirty. There is no soap. The mosquito net around the bed is broken. There is only 1 table in the room. No nightstands.
The service was fine. And outside the room it looks cute.
I'd recommend it if you're going for budget and bring your own soap and shampoo. But for a bit more you can get a lot more.","The kindness and friendliness we experienced here from the first to the very last moment is incredible. You can feel that everyone here wants to give you a good feeling while staying here. Clean rooms, great shower, good working ac, great atmosphere and amazing meals all over the day.
If we ever come back to Bali - this is the place to stay. And the cheapest in the area as well. (I think) usually I say, that you just get, what you pay for, but here you get very much, for a really low price."

I had originally planned on only staying 3 days but ended up staying 6. The property is located in a side street so it is super quiet and perfect to relax. The property manager Wayan is one of a kind and just an amazing human being! Always a smile on his face and was available at anytime.
Every morning I was offered fresh Balinese cakes with tea or coffee and they were delicious. Wayan made sure to get a different selection everyday.
The beds are super comfortable and have 4 soft pillows available to make it even more comfortable. I slept like a baby!
The rooms could use a bit of plaster touch-up and a coat of fresh paint but that’s about all.
The price for a nights stay is unbeatable. Do not think twice if you need an accommodation in the area, stay here!
Thanks for everything Wayan!","Amazing price with the quality. Room is clean and quiet with good AC. There are only 3 rooms, so easy to use the shared kitchen with the fridge. Wifi is sometimes weak but basically okay.
The host Wayan is so nice, he's always helpful.

My favorite warung in Pemuteran is:
①Warung makan Darma Jaya(cheap and good food options)
②Warung mek siti(local and good quality, also cheap)
③Jukung resto Bali(very reasonable price with good atmosphere and great sea view)
④Lakawi(hamburger shop, a bit expensive but the taste is definitely above the price)",Stayed here in October 2023 and loved it! Tucked away in a less touristy area of Bali. The room is nice and minimalist with a big bathroom. Pak Budi is incredibly helpful and a generous person. Great price too!,"This was one of the best places we stayed at! Budi was amazing, he helped us out with anything we needed! He was so helpful and responded always super quick. He even arranged for our laundry to be cleaned (dropped and picked it up for us!).
The room is spacious and clean, the bed very comfortable. The half outside bathroom is super nice and all rooms have a nice terrace towards the garden where breakfast is served.
The location is close to the beach and some good restaurants. It is more quite and not much going on, so maybe not for party people but for those who want to relax and have a nice couple of nights 🧡","All you ever need. Wayan is a great Host and helpfull in whatever you need. Like bike rentals or recommendations for activities. Good Wifi, good AC, clean Linens...very quiet and near to good Restaurants and the Beach. Bali Koffee and cakes for breakfast. Highly recommended...great Value!"

We will be back  for sure."

The gardens are lush punctuated by a really nicely sized pool which I never seem to drop into.

You are in an awesome location with local and western food within walking distance, and of course, the beach.  Ron can arrange diving if you like.

A true pleasurable stay in this magical area.","Ron and Myta are fantastic. They pair up with Abyss Ocean World to make for a perfect PADI dive center. We stayed at Hibiscus, and dives at Menjangan for a week. Over that time Ron and Myta helped us with transport, served breakfast, recommended warungs (and warned which ones had gotten guests ill), made up our bungalow, and welcomed us to Permuteran. A diamond in the rough. If you enjoy scuba, the quiet life, a deep and refreshing pool, and great vibes, this is the spot. Oh, and they are welcoming and wonderful with children too!","A quiet retreat in a gorgeous part of Bali with beautiful large clean rooms with comfortable beds set amongst beautiful tranquil gardens and sparkling pool.

Easy walk to the beach and local warungs and a short drive or ride to some excellent day spas, dive companies and mini marts for the self caterer.

The hosts are very helpful and make you feel at home. If you are into environmental activity this is the place. The hosts not only actively engage in local conservation work above and below the water, and you can get involved too…. Or just quietly enjoy this  wonderful property and fascinating region.
All photos I have posted are on the property- there are 2 bungalows, 2 small joglos and a large 2 bedroom villa with an upper level open air lounge. The owners live on the property in a villa.
The street is quiet and the only sounds at night are various animals and maybe the local temple. It really is lovely.","Ron the owner is very kind and helpful person. Our house was very clean and beautiful! If you are planning to be in Pemuteran and want a peaceful place near beach, Hibiscus house is the perfect choice.","Lovely place but the wood chalet room are too small to live well without AC, you have a machine ""cooling the air"" but not efficient. American owner not happy to guest people, just to have a bit more money. So all compared, you can really get better for less money. (in the same street we tried better)."

Such a great place to escape, will come again when we go to Bali🥰","Good place for a good price. You can borrow the bikes, they are good but don't expect too much though. The swimming pool is ok in size, not too big and not too small. The rooms are good and each room has its own veranda with chairs. The bed is excellent. Although our room did not have airco, this was not a problem at night. The bathroom is in the open air and that was very special. Each room is situated privately with green grass around it.

All of our expectations were met : lovely bungalow, lovely overflow pool, outside bathroom and great service !!
Fati and her stunning team organized for us snorkeling excursion for a day and we had the chance to swim with turtles !!
Furthermore, I work in a travel agency and we use this hotel for our clients as it’s a great value for money.
Hope you’ll stay there !!!","Very nice stay at SuniaLoka

We just spent 4 days at SuniaLoka and enjoyed our stay very much. The bungalows a pretty simple yet with nice touches, the garden is beautiful and the swimming pool very welcoming after an afternoon at the beach.
Fati the owner and her staff will do their best to make you feel at home and will give you good recommendations for scuba diving, activities etc
Overall the value for price is very good. I definitely recommend it","Charming bungalow in a large tropical garden. The owner, Fati, is great and so is her staff ! Great place to stay in Pemuteran and enjoy nearby activities."
