Wayan and Nyoman are truly welcoming and charming people. Donâ€™t expect something touristy, but expect to live with them as they do and share great moments. Surya (the sister of Wayan) walked us into the beautiful rice terrace. We tasted almost every fruit we found on our way! Nyoman is such a good cook... 4 dinners in a raw far better than any of our other experiences in Bali! We had a great day trip to visit the region with Agus, such a nice person too. We also spent a lot of time discussing with Wayan the Balinese culture, ours and also having fun. He knows a lot! Thanks again to the family for those amazing 4 days!",Wayan and his family will make you feel like you're part of his family and village and teach you anything you want to learn about the traditional Balinese village culture. He shared his vast knowledge about the forest plants and rice growing process on our rice terrace/jungle trek. He even invited me to a village cremation ceremony -- such an honor to be able to see and experience a sacred ceremony like this. Wayan is the perfect ambassador for the Balinese village life. I highly recommend his program!,,,
