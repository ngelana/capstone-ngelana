Unbelievable
I booked this hotel for my brother and when we arrived came to that hotel it was so unbelievable! Dark hotel,the building look not well maintain also I checked the room it was so smelly very strong mould smell! I cannot breat all the wall full of mould! It‚Äôs really unhealthy hotel.

Don‚Äôt believe on their picture please read the reviews first.

Hotel nya jelek,mahal dan bau jamur di kamar gak sehat lingkungan hotelnya! Gak rekomend jangan percaya sama yg di foto.","If I could give this -10 stars I would. The building is not well maintained and the rooms smell mouldy. Everything about this place is strange.

We originally booked the room online and prepaid with a credit card. Upon arrival we were told that the online price is too low and we would need to pay more or cancel our booking (which means you do not get a refund as cancellation is no longer an option once you‚Äôve arrived .) We ended up leaving and managed to receive a refund from the app we had booked on.

Really terrible experience.","It was terrible experience to stay in this hotel. I cannot even give a star. The room is stinky, I couldn‚Äôt breathe bcoz of the smell. The wall is dirty, the ac doesn‚Äôt work properly, the bathroom sink is leaking and the exhaust is broken. Even when i enter the room on first day, it was not cleaned (bathroom floor was fully wet as if someone just took shower, the side table drawer was full of cigarette ashes).
I complained to the receptionist and asked to change the room but she said it was full, no more room. I said I cannot stay there anymore and asking for refund, but she said they cannot return the money as it‚Äôs the hotel policy. There‚Äôs no action at all from them to solve my complaint. It was very terrible service. I won‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone. Guys, you can find another hotel which has same price with much better room and service.","This is quite possibly the worst hotel I've ever had and I've traveled budget quite a bit.

And it didn't have to be bad. Looking at the materials and the original design of the rooms at least the idea behind it was good. But whomever is responsible for execution really screwed up in a big way. Nothing in the way this hotel is build is done well. The incompetence of the builders and maintenance is beyond me. Every expensive building material is ruined by stains of paint, concrete, plaster and cometely ruined. Things are unclean, finishes are the cheapest and most amateur I've ever seen. Aircon not working properly nothing seems cleaned. Luckily the bedsheets looked decent. That OYO allows this building to carry it's name I don't understand.

How can a hotel have staff that doesn't even speak English in one of the most touristy places on earth?","Staff were helpful and they have motorbike rental.

Aside from that;
The room smelt so bad of mould we asked to move room it was so strong and overpowering. The room we were moved too was dirty - massive cobwebs and it rained into the room through the wall. Also people in the next room had Karaoke until midnight.  Needs a refurb. The pictures are not accurate.

Spend the extra bit of money and stay somewhere else."

Needs painting throughout, floors need to be cleaned, shower tiles need black and white deposits cleaned off. Rooms need anti-insect treatments, pool needs to be drained and missing tiles replaced and grout applied, kitchen needs to open for breakfasts, furniture replaced or restored where necessary. If all of these things are done, the hotel will resemble what the photos show. We were so disappointed with the state of the property, after 1 night we booked a different hotel for the remaining 4 nights of our stay in Canggu.","It was a scary stay, with paint peeling and mold in many surfaces. There was strange noises at night, maybe from other guests? Room floor didn‚Äôt feel that clean and the toilet water ran all day and night long. It is the cheapest hotel in the area though‚Ä¶ so you kinda get what you pay for.","1. The wall paint is no longer in tact
2. the wallpaper has never been wiped
3. the window curtain seems like it has collected dust since its opened!!
4. The bedsheets were not clean! i need to ask the staff to change all the bedsheets.

I felt quite ripped off since I saw the picture versus what I got in actuality.
Plus I heard the owner hasn't visited in the last 3 years which explains the abysmal of this place. Also rumor has it, the owner knew of the horrible complaints from guests and chose to ignore them.

Yikes!","Definitely will come back soon :) really liked the artsy yet cozy and peaceful ambience here. Had a good rest in the clean & minimalist bed room. They gave us a fresh welcome drink!(which is so nice after an exhausting day). The front desk and staffs were very nice and friendly. There were a room with some art stuff exhibition as well, with a piano and a reading room beside it. Haven't explored the whole building yet but looking forward to in the next stay ;)"

The rooms are spacious, well-appointed, and boast stunning views of the picturesque landscape. Cleanliness is clearly a top priority here, and the attention to detail is truly commendable.

The expansive outdoor spaces are a highlight of this property, providing a perfect setting to unwind and connect with nature. The manicured gardens, dotted with vibrant  tall trees, create a serene ambience that is both refreshing and rejuvenating. Whether enjoying a morning coffee on the patio or an evening stroll through the grounds, every moment spent outdoors is a pure delight.","One of very few large villas in Changgu that can accommodate 18 plus. Property is 12 years old and it does shows in some areas. First owner is a Norwegian and he likes cooking so there is a big open plan kitchen plus separate BBQ. Rooms are adequate but be careful of the hardwood bed frames which can give you a bruise. The pool is the highlight. Fairly well maintained despite being amongst the trees. Good for large groups of 14 plus. Not good for kids as staircases without railings. The staff is excellent. They are very flexible. Just slowly explained what you need. We had an excellent last night Indonesian meal. If the current Indonesian owner is willing to redo the place, it will be excellent. Note there are plenty of natural insects plus small animals roaming around.","Villa Tirtadari is the most amazing location to stay in Bali; it is spacious, clean, has bathtubs and showers in the jungle, numerous rooms, and offers excellent service. There are a total of seven apartments with attached bathrooms. Spacious kitchen, dining area, and living area with a view of the pool. The villa manager and staff went above and beyond to ensure that our wedding and stay were flawless. Strongly recommended.","Went here because a friend booked this place for his wedding reunion. 7 rooms in total with bathroom inside of the rooms. Wide kitchen, open dining room and living room with the view of the pool. It feels nice.

All staffs are friendly, food tasted good","It's a 7 rooms villa with reasonable price. Surrounded with greens and a lap pool, I enjoyed like a wealthy man. It's maintained by a group of villa assistants. We had a sumptuous buffet dinner at the villa cooked by the staff of the villa.

Here‚Äôs my takeaways from the stay.

Pros;
- New rooms
- Good location, easy access to Canggu and Seminyak.
- Fairly quiet at night
- Good AC
- Pool

Cons;
- Wifi is absolutely terrible. I had to arrange a cable (at my own cost) from the router to my room, in order to internet connection.
- Cleaning is sporadic and not very well done. I don't think my bathroom was properly cleaned during my whole stay. The glass wall in the bathroom was fairly clean when moving in (it was new), then when I moved out, you couldn‚Äôt even se trough it.
- Changing of linen and sheets was only done after I kindly reminded that it was time.
- Lack of kitchen supplies.
- I had belongings stored in the drawers of the desk which started to mold (I guess because poor wood material). Management promised to have a look and get back with a solution for the items that where damaged. Still haven't heard anything (been over 1 week since I moved out).
- Desk and chair in the room are not even remotely close of being ergonomic. The seat height of the chair is extremely low in relationship to the desk height.
- No furniture for balcony
- Construction next door can be pretty loud during daytime.
- Construction/maintenance being done at the house, without any sort of heads up, can interfere with work and phone calls.

I'm giving a very kind rating of 2-star.
The place has potential to be much better.
Wish them all the best to try and sort it out!

Update: After kindly asked management again about my items that has been destroyed, they have given me a quick reply that nothing can be done about this. So I guess I will have to lower my rating to a 1 star...",nice place. 3 months stay was comfortable and nice that electric is included,Clean and friendly staff.
