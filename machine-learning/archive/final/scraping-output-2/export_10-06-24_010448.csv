This hotel is only worth 220k. Who rated this hotel as a 4 star hotel? It is not even 3 stars. Of course. Geckos can crawl into your room at any time. The housekeeping can't even tell the front and back of the quilt on the bed. This is the first time I have seen a 4 star hotel only use two pillows on the bed. The same price hotels in Gili Islands have good rooms and are clean. Don't waste your money on this hotel,"Unpleasant experience!! The first 3 night the housekeeping forgot make up our room. We have had told the receptionist however they still not doing the room, lack communication!!
Room is spacious however needs some serious cleaning, moldy shower.
The staff need proper training and standards SOP.
Ala card foods mostly frozen foods.

You never feel alone, even in the morning. Their presence made each day delightful, making every interaction feel like catching up with old friends and making it very hard to leave!

The local team, from those who prepared delicious breakfasts and dinners to those who maintained the lodge and surroundings were all exceptionally warm and friendly. They always greeted me with genuine kindness and took the time to ask about my day, adding a personal touch to my stay.

The surf instructors, also locals, were fantastic‚Äîpatient, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic. They were not only the best instructors I've ever had but also made learning and improving my surfing skills a breeze.

Although I'm not usually a cat person, the lodge's feline residents were just as charming as everything else, winning over my heart as well with their unique personalities.

It was a very welcoming atmosphere from the start, especially the host was good at introducing the way of living in Bali.

Very spacious and with aircon and a surprisingly delightful outside bathroom which was a bew experience for me that I embraced wholeheartedly! You're om a trimopical island so of course expect a few friendly bugs and house lizards. Those things dont bother me as I grew up in the Caribbean. We experienced the most relaxing couples massage (we both snored unashamedly !) and the floating breakfast was an experience I always wanted to try and got the opportunity to do it there as it was part of my package.
We ate at the restaurant once and it's ok. We did order Grab food which the reception brought to our villa. We took up their offers for free transport to the Cafe del Mar and Atlas beach clubs and spent our first 2 days intro to Bali totally unwinding at them both. Cafe del mar is more classy in my opinion but Atlas' day bed in the infinity pool was dreamy.
Overall a very tranquil hotel and spacious accommodation and wonderful staff. I would definitely stay here again.",Nice place to enjoy dining. Nasi goreng rendang is my fav. Nice staff and good abience.,"The place is really cozy. The staff is nice and service is good.
But the food is not worth the money. For breakfast which costs 185,000 I got two cold eggs with a muffin, although from the description I expected to have egg benedict with English muffin, poached egg, bacon or ham, sauteed spinach, hollandaise sauce all served with potato of the day, grilled tomato, sauteed mushroom.","it was impossible tasty and unbelievably beautiful.  the restaurant has a huge garden area with bridges over the river, rice fields and other areas for photos.  the food just melted in my mouth.  I highly recommend this restaurant","First time come to Plataran at Canggu recommended by a friend and amazed by the ambiance from the restaurant. Finally found the best Indonesian restaurant in the island! Tried the Pad Thai made by the chef and its recommended because its so delicious. Would like to try another menu but my stomach already full. The staff at restaurant have excellent service to make the customer really enjoy the restaurant. Thanks to anna for taking care us. I love the architecture inside the restaurant, i love the slow music which make the restaurant more enjoyable. Will come back again to try others menu from the restaurant. I'll be back!"
