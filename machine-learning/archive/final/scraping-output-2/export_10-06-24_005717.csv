From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warm hospitality and a serene ambiance that immediately put me at ease.

The location of the hotel is ideal, nestled in a peaceful area surrounded by lush greenery, providing a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. The rooms are beautifully designed, blending traditional Balinese aesthetics with modern comforts. My room was spacious, immaculately clean, and featured a private terrace with stunning views of the surrounding nature.

The amenities at De Moksha are top-notch. The pool area is a highlight, offering a tranquil setting to relax and unwind. The on-site restaurant serves delicious meals made with fresh, local ingredients, and the breakfast options are particularly impressive. I also appreciated the yoga classes and spa services, which added to the overall sense of relaxation and well-being.

What truly sets De Moksha apart is the staff. They are incredibly friendly, attentive, and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure that guests have a memorable stay. Their genuine care and attention to detail made me feel welcome and valued throughout my visit.

Overall, De Moksha is a hidden gem in Bali. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful retreat or a base to explore the island, this hotel offers an unparalleled experience. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Bali.","The room was very comfortable, bathroom semi-outdoor, very clean.
The service was great, very helpful and full of smile.
Location is great, surrounded by padi fields.
If you are looking for a night life or busy street - this place might be a bit far from it. But if you are looking for a zen time, slow living, yoga and peace, this is the prefect place.

My experience staying in this hotel is very pleasant.
I even extend my stay for 1 more night.

Will definitely come back. Recommended.","Both my family and myself had an absolute amazing time stayting at the resort! The room were very well catered for, the stay were friendly and the food in the restaurant was delicious and had a great verity, the pools areas were clean and large and made us all feel very relaxed, I highly recommend yo anybody! Thanks to the staff, made us feel both special and comfortable! Will definitely be back! 5 stars!!","This is an absolutely beautiful property. Hidden away from the cities in a very quiet location with wonderful facilities to relax and recharge. My wife enjoyed the yoga classes and our son enjoyed the pools. The beds are very comfortable, the rooms are well appointed and the staff are tremendous in their attention to detail making your stay very comfortable. The food at breakfast was delicious and even used the restaurant for our dinners which were great too. We used the bikes to explore the villages and rice fields in the area too. A nice touch to have those available.","I did the 7 days yoga retreat. De moksha is a very peaceful place, perfect to spend some time with yourself and let your thoughts flow. The staff and yoga teachers are so friendly and just great people. It‚Äôs so flexible with all the different classes and activities you can create the retreat like you prefer it. The yoga classes were all very good but especially the meditation at the beach was a great highlight. Also I liked, that with some activities you would learn more about Balinese culture and daily life. The food was very good too, I‚Äôm vegan and they would also change dishes for me (grilled tempeh instead of fish). There are plenty of options to choose from, but if you preferred something different - no problem. All in all I would definitly come back :) Thank you for this amazing time"

It was surrounded by ricefield, the setting was scenic and peaceful that you would be escaped from noisy traffic.

The location was private yet its conveniently located near the traditional market, Tanah Lot, Kedungu Beach and the hip area of Canggu.

My highlight of the stay was their rooftop that made it a perfect spot to chill with the beautiful cool breeze blowing throughout ‚ù§Ô∏è","Really enjoyed my 4N stay here. Spacious, clean, and the facility is more than enough to make my work from Bali quite enjoyable. They got hammock to chill, and a decent home-workout equipment for your pre-beach showdown ü§£

They got 3 bedrooms, each with spacious hot shower, and aircon worked perfectly during my stay.

Located at Tabanan area, its not that far from Canggu, so you can always go out to popular cafe / shop nearby for about 15mins. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",,
