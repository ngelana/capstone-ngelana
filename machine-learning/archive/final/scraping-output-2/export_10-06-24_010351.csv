My partner & I are staying local for 2 weeks and have already been here 4 times.

The space is huge and feels like a mansion, while keeping the decor welcoming and very beautifully designed.

The menu has some of the best options to choose from, and the quality of the food is unmatched.

We‚Äôve been here for both brunch & dinner and have enjoyed every single time.

The team are all super lovely and attentive, the music has always been on point, and they even have live music on the weekend which is a bonusü•∞

I will be back here without doubt anytime I‚Äôm in the area‚ù§Ô∏è","Great place, not very easy to find, but definitely worth a visit.
Excellent food (and very quickly prepared !), good prices, great service. Beautiful surroundings, especially in the evening.
I recommend it to everyone !","We came here at around 3pm. Ambiance was so relaxing.. food was surprisingly good.. they were even willing to make adjustment for my daughter who can't eat spicy. Staffs were friendly. They have 2 batik shops, ones where you can get high end, good quality, even some good souvenirs. They even have access to the beach!
We were happy and really enjoyed our timeüåàüß°",What a wonderful place. I loved everything about it. It is a must to go. I ordered the laksa and the mash potatoes with chicken. Yummy.  There was a exhibition of textiles from Sumba on the second floor. Fantastic!,"Lovely to visit Masa Masa ü´∂
We're here because of the traditional indonesian vintage umbrella painting event held by Phithecanthropus Bali.

There was also an exhibition of Batik Pesisiran that was so much to see. We enjoyed some dishes here and loved the selection of juices and coffees. Each menu in this restaurant was unique, well presented and most importantly delicious.

Beautiful interiors and beautiful place overall. The staffs were friendly and proactive. They made us feel very welcome and regularly came to check if we needed anything else.

Truly a wonderful place for people who love great ambience and Peranakan cuisine charm üåü"

The vibe is family bar with music and drinks. However the food is not my taste (I ordered steak and wanted it to be medium but turned out as well done anyway). But the apple bbq sauce was interesting. The satay from pan kobar tasted better than the rest of the food that I ordered.,"Nice looking atmospheric cafe with mediocre cuisine and poor service.

Tenderloin was made from a bad piece of meat and macchiato was not macchiato at all. The juices were severely deluded despite the high price and the fact that we specifically asked not to add water.","Nice place, good vibes, food is good and cheap. The right place for lunch or dinner if pass ketewel or keramas beach",Quite a bit on the expensive side considering the location. Food was good but the portions are small and didn't match the price. Tax and service charge makes things even more expensive.,"great decor / interior. all outdoor seating but is covered; has couches and other furniture. bathrooms clean, plenty of parking. worth the stop if in the area. It‚Äôs right off the highway. pizza average but they got the order wrong; that‚Äôs not a margarita pizza. still, relaxing and worth a shot."
