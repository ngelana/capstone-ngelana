A place of worship for Buddhists, not as large as I imagined but it is very beautiful",The entrance is free but you can donate. They lend you a sarong. It‚Äôs the biggest Buddha in Bali. Little far but great to do a bike ride through Bali‚Äôs west side.,Peaceful and beautiful place to visit. No crowd at all. Lots of time to enjoy blissful time in presence of Lord Buddha.,"A wonderful out of the way Temple definitely worth a stop.  The caretakers are incredibly kind and gentle.  As expected, knees showing is forbidden however they will gladly lend you a sarong.   A donation is encouraged.   Washrooms, vendors, etc nearby to meet needs.   Parking free.   The giant white laying Buddha reminds me of the giant golden and giant green Buddha‚Äôs in Vietnam.","The place is very quiet, no need to pay a ticket, just donate, sarongs are provided, footwear must be removed when entering the Buddhist area‚ô•Ô∏è"

Not many Buddhist places in Bali.  Not much to see....just the laying Buddha and a few other smaller shrines and gardens.  Donations are expected to enter.  I gave 20,000 which I think is the norm.",The monastery is very spectacular and amazing. I know it's quite far away. But totally very recommended if you visit to the north. No ticket entrance but you can give donation on the contrary. When I arrive at there I just feel peaceful and calm. Wear proper clothes when you visit there. There is two dogs also they are nice. Brown one Rocky and Juju.,"Check out this vihara, it's amazing! Super chill vibes üåüüçÉ and a giant sleeping Buddha statue. A perfect place to unwind and find inner peace! üôèüõê",Super quite place. The best view for meditate and calm down your busy mind and crowd soul. Must visited place when you are in north Bali,Well worth a visit beautiful tranquil place
