With kids or without.

100k entrance fee, free coffee or tea, restroom

Park is included museum, shop, garden with river and waterfall, lakes small one, cave with spiders, house of butterfly

People here are very friendly and explain everything about butterfly and other insects, animals, very helpful.

We spend here 2 hours
Down to the park they have huge Warung with Indonesian food and drinks

Better to wear one color clothes, take pics and put sunscreen on the face!

We enjoyed walking in the garden it was impressive! üòç

What was sad and weird: half of museum is under reconstruction, some boxes don‚Äôt have any information even name of this, you don‚Äôt know what do you watching here. in spiders cave half of boxes was empty with dead bugs :(((( I mean, take care of the place and respect for animal","We stopped in on the recommendation of our driver, Aan Yudianto. It's a lovely park with an assortment of beautiful orchids, stunning butterflies, bonsai trees, birds and animals. Some of the cages seemed far too small for the animals but overall it's a fabulous experience. There is also a water park (additional cost) though we didn't purchase tickets for it.","Compact, lush and well-curated. Up close with butterflies and stick insects. Cocoons are collected from the park and incubated, very educational for the kids to see the actual growth cycle. Fun to have butterflies and moths sticking to your hands and shirts! Rp100k is a bit costly for foreigners but worth the experience and help to maintain this park.","Visited the butterfly park recently and was absolutely enchanted! The serene atmosphere, coupled with the vibrant fluttering of butterflies, made for a truly mesmerizing experience. The staff were incredibly attentive and knowledgeable, enhancing our visit even more. Highly recommend this tranquil haven!","I love the moths!! They're so adorable üòç Reasonable ticket prices. Unique experience, highly recommended."

The price's affordable. I'm sure that i'll be back next time‚ò∫Ô∏è",Cozy place.. Nice food. Nice view.. The Best!,"Oh wow. If you are visiting from overseas to see the butterfly park and want some food that will blow your expectations out of the water then come here (its a short walk). We came with our two toddlers and had the set menu (as a tourist I love that). It was incredibly fresh fish (GT) and absolutely authentic Indonesian cuisine. It was an actual cultural experience visiting here. The service was also excellent and it was well priced at 130k idr for meals and drinks for me, my wife and our toddlers. Highly recommended.","Food is best! The same taste as the original mak Beng in Sanur. Good service from staffs. Nice atmosphere, but maybe can play a more calm songs playlist for accompanying people eating. üëçüëçüëç"
