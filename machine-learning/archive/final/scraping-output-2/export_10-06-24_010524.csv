The price and atmosphere is very local and so is the taste. We ordered grilled fish, clams, prawns, vegetables and a very nice seafood stew.

The seafood all tasted fresh and the sauce layered on top was savoury, sweet and smoky at the same time. The clams stew was amazing as well, tasted a little sour and spicy.","Amazing local bbq seafood restaurant in Kerobokan. Dinned in on a Saturday night the restaurant was full.

Would recommend to anyone visiting Bali wanting a reliable, private, hidden gem.","Just for lunch with a friend it‚Äôs a great place, lots of space and a well-priced menu.

However, for group reservations they clearly have no system and very poor communication.

Things that went wrong:
- they set up the wrong table for me and my guests (I had very clearly described which table I wanted)
- without asking me, waiters had decided for themselves to put everyone‚Äôs orders on separate bills (they asked their names when ordering; I didn‚Äôt realise this until several people had already left and paid their own bill. I had wanted to pay all or at least part of everyone‚Äôs bill but staff never discussed this with me, very disappointing and not how I wanted to treat my guests)
- I was made to pay a deposit of 1jt to make the reservation 10 days prior. No problem. After everyone had left I was asked to pay my leftover bill, again no problem (but already disappointed they had let all my guests pay their own full bills). Then I asked for my deposit back, or to take my bill off of it. Staff looked at me puzzled, no one seemed to know I had paid a deposit, I had to show them proof of the transfer. Then they refused to pay it back, claiming it was supposed to be food and drink credit. No one had told me this, plus there was nothing left to use it for as everyone‚Äôs bills had been paid (without my knowledge).

No flexibility or apologies from staff on any of this. No other solution given but to order some take out on the rest of the ‚Äúdeposit‚Äù. What had been a lovely celebration ended in disappointment, due to their terrible communication and zero problem-solving skills after their own mistakes.","bought some of their foods and it was just okay. however, i really like the place, you got small playground for kids and swimming pool.",We meet here regularly and it is always such a great time getting together.

There is 10 Room in this Villa and every Room has Private Pool and they are unique. When the first time I come, I was really surprise. First, the Room was really big. The size is about 27m2 maybe. Second, the room is really clean and tidy, also the pool was cleaned every morning. Third, Bedroom is standard Hotel or even better. Bed is using King Koil :).

Nice inside with a view over the rice paddies.
The iced Jurian drink was so good and the coffee just right.
Shame not getting many customers.","It's great when things are well-maintained. I enjoy the coffee; however, the place feels a bit empty and neglected. Despite that, I hope this spot becomes lively with more visitors and regains its charm. Wishing continuous success for this place. üçÉ","WHY do you allow customers to smoke in a cafe? Everything was perfect, and I was about to give a 5-star review until your staff let people smoke INSIDE the cafe and offer ash trays to them. Then I decided to leave and not come back anymore. What a pity! At one moment, I thought I found my perfect working cafe with good food, plugs, good WiFi, and a nice vibe.","I hate this place, I thought I can chill in here, turns out its a DJ House not a cafe. What a ZONK! I won't coming back to this place anymore. And the  coffee just so-so","Actually this is quiet good, but need to improve cleanliness. The food just so so or more to bad, the fish and chip so fishy. The owner doesnt  respect the customer, she turn on the ‚Äúmusic‚Äù loudly from her phone even the cafe already playing good music. Very disturbing."
