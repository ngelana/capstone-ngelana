The architecture is an open air joglo style with natural wood. The location is perfect, next to a clear river. You can even hear the peaceful waterfall sound while eating here. Their best menu is fried duck with green & red chili sambal and fresh coconut. I hope there will be more menu in the future. Highly recommended!",,,,
