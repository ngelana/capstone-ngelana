Aluf took so many pictures of us, he was soo sweet that even gave us a papaya from the tree next to the waterfall.
Definitely worth to come back","Beautiful place, very big waterfall, probably the highest of all the nearby, the place is not very promoted yet and there are very few tourists, we were met by a local guy and had a personalized tour, was very polite and attentive. We had a great time.","Most amazing waterfall,we had so much fun, the ppl there are very kind and welcoming, you go throw the rice fields then some stairs and then you are in heaven, price is 20k.","Such a beautiful waterfall! We were lucky to be the only ones there, got to swim, climbed the waterfall and just relax in nature. The locals at the entrance were super friendly, and there is a little warung right next to the entrance to eat before or after your visit to the waterfall.","Rather unknown and new, but such a beautiful and hidden place. The owner personally took us down and took some gorgeous photos and videos for us. Man made steps down the jungle through rice terraces towards the river. The trek can be a little difficult for older individuals or people with bad knees (the steps are big and steep!) but when you land in front of the falls the view will take your breath away! Highly recommend, especially if you sick of waiting in line for photos of waterfalls- true beauty of Bali !"

I agree with the favourable reviews for this little establishment as the food was simple but fresh and tasty. I spent only 20,000Rp (less than AUD$2) including a delicious blue lychee drink. Look at the prices. Food here is great value for money and tasty as well. Word of warning though: If you need to use the bathroom, watch out for the incredibly low doorway. It was built for hobbits. I bumped my head hard, which of course is largely my own fault.",Absolutely amazing! I would give 10 stars! The best shrimps I had on Bali! Better than at much expensive ones! Also blue lychee drink is perfect!,Really good local food and super affordable prices for this quality. Highly recommend to stop here for a quick lunch on your waterfall tour.,Very nice local family restaurant with local prices. I had a fried chicken breast and it was very delicious. I recommend stopping by if you are around.,Incredible local food near Ubud. Totally recommend to eat here!
