Super stylish and nestled in tranquility, it's clear that the villa was created with love. The pool offers breathtaking views of the sea during the day and the starry sky at night, which is an absolute delight. We are immensely grateful for the opportunity to use the telescope for the first time, seeing the moon up close brought us immense joy. The thoughtful details and small touches around the villa are impossible to overlook and greatly appreciated. We are so happy to have stayed here and for such a memorable experience. Special thanks to Budi for being attentive and ensuring we had a wonderful time, always available whenever we needed anything. I can't wait to return! This has now become one of my favorite places!","We found this villa on Instagram. We were attracted by its unusual minimalist design, opens up glass roof and the location. We thought it was the perfect place to relax and we were not wrong. We stayed in this wonderful place for 2 nights.
The villa is located on a mountain near the Lovina area, a 15-minute bike ride from the center. This place is full of tranquility. From the villa, there is a stunning view of Lovina and beautiful landscapes: picturesque rice fields, and the sea.
Everything necessary for a comfortable stay is provided here. There is a kitchen with utensils where you can cook your own food, a coffee machine to make delicious lattes or cappuccinos. At night, you can observe the stars through a telescope or gaze at the glass roof. Enjoy swimming in the pool and marvel at the sunrise and sunset.
The road to the villa is not bad which is a big plus! It's easy to get there by bike or car. The host and staff were attentive and polite, always ready to help. They also organized a dolphin tour for us, where we could enjoy the sunrise and swim with dolphins.
As it turned out, the villa has recently opened, so we were among the first guests. I want to leave a review and support it because the place is truly beautiful and deserves positive feedback! Let as many people as possible learn about this place!",Wonderful view and quiet pleace good for holiday and honeymoon.thanks,,
