The room is clean. AC good, hot water good, there's kettle & small fridge. You can borrow hair dryer from the hotel. Location is beach front where local people nearby will approach you for good early morning dolphin tour. Overall its great value hotel","Nice hotel at the seaside in a quiet spot. Decent spot and attractive price. The standard rooms are pretty basic, especially regarding the bathroom. This would need some update. But we would definitely come again!","We booked hear for 2 nights then extended for another 3 nights.
The staff are excellent and very friendly also speak good English
The pools are very good
Hotel is clean
Food was delicious!!
The view from the restaurant and pools are amazing

If you do an employee of the month this should definitely go to BAYOU (apologies if not spelled correctly)
He was a true gentleman","LEGEND BUT TOO OLD

Let's start the review from beginning. We were a big group and wanted to stay in Lovina area, therefore we needed a lot of rooms. We knew Puri Saron Lovina was a big hotel with a lot of rooms. Long before arrival, we asked the sales about our needs and requests e.g. some requested to stay at first floor because they are old, some requested twin bed, some requested connecting room, etc. Everything went good until the check-in time. We found out that some of the requests were wrong and I think there was no good cooperation between sales and receptionist/front office. After long discussion (debate), finally we got all the rooms we needed. I got the superior room and it was ordinary. It looked very old from outside, it was wide but quite smelly, the AC needed time to get cold, bathroom was clean, but the terrace was terrible with dirty pond. The outside area was better. Swimming pool was perfect, there was gazebos to relax too, and located in front of the coastal. Some of us requested breakfast box because the would go to watch dolphin, but the ""american breakfast"" they got was only 2 slices of bread. Meanwhile, the rest of us got buffet breakfast and the menu was quite diverse. The staff was good and fast. Although we got problem when we checked-in, they solved it quick and we really appreciate it. Thank you","Rooms are normal as u wish.
Food is only tasty in the morning, dinner was not a very good experience, people doesn’t understand English, so your food will come wrong 9 out of 10.
There is no beach only pool.
But the people were friendly but has to learn better English."

It also kid friendly because they have some toys, they have swing, and they also provide mosquito repellent if you need it.

Their foods are delicious, the portion is small but the price is cheap, so I guess is fair enough. All the foods and drinks here are lovely.

When my daughter got hurt and cry from playing, the owner offer to give ice cube for compression, he even give free ice cream to cheer her up, such a lovely person, also the staff, the service here is really nice.

We really enjoyed spending our time here, this is a good place to eat or hangout.","Amazing location, great atmosphere, super friendly stuff and the food is really good, yes the portion might be small but check the prices again! For portionsize and taste it's too cheap, good drinks and the interior is so pleasent not to talk about the owner who's a legend!","Amazing service and food, we felt very welcomed and we had a lot of fun doing karaoke !!! Go there if you can !","Nice ambiance, the food is quite good however the portions are extremely small. It’s like ordering a kid's menu.","Everything is very good, the food, the hospitality, the price. So I highly recommend it. the owner is very kind and super hospitable.
