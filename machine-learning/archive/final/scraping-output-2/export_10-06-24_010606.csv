The room was spacious, it's old but clean enough, with basic amenities provided in the bathroom. Water pressure was great but sometimes it could be weaker or slower than usual. The AC worked perfectly although it's dripping a bit (room 319). Breakfast was basic, fried rice, breads, coffee, once they asked me if i wanted omelettes but strangely they didn't ask the next day.

all in all, due to the dates (checked in on 29th December), location, and prices, it was good and no complaints what so ever."

Room was dusty, bed sheet stained and stinky, and toilet smelled like sewer. I went on with it, just asked the frontdesk to clean it daily.

On another night, I was awoken several times from constant banging and cracking noise from outside. The worst part was when something dropped to the floor and echoed through the storey. I got out, found a single staff clumsily preparing breakfast while blasting music in his ear - so he wasn't aware of all the noises he made, simply grinned and said ""Sorry, I dropped something"". I went downstairs to find a ""guard"" and asked him to control the noise, etc - but he harked back rudely, like picking a fight.

Kind of give up on expecting anything civil from this place. If anyone could say it is relaxing, maybe a boxing match with the ""guard"" is a form of stress release.","best bang for your buck.
the receptionist is friendly, nice , good service ,  i got a twin bed room which is nice, cozy, the AC is cold, clean room and tidy,

maybe the only downside is the security is a little bit snooping around, or Kepo in Indonesian 😂😅, my friends got questioned when they wanna visit me.

I also ordered fruit soup here. The price is pricy, but it worthed with the taste. The location of restaurant is exactly opposite from the souvenir shop Krishna.","Betutu chicken, so hot but so delicious, the “sambal matah” has a kick of chilli and shallot","An amazing Restaurant in the heart of Bali, and absolutely Denpasar as the Capital City of Bali... this restaurant have a great ambience with the hospitality of local people.

This restaurant give us the best experience to keep in touch with business partner while in work hour, have a meeting agenda in this meeting room is so reasonable price (maybe i could say its so cheap packages start from 25k for 2 hours meeting include coffee break or 50k for 2 hours meeting with lunch/dinner selected signature dish!)

Totally awesome.... many packages such as “choose 3 of 6 menus just only 60k start from 11.00 - 18.00”
Ayam Betutu Asli Gilimanuk (signature spicy chicken 🐓 with traditional herbs, I guarantee you will be addicted) if you don’t like spicy... you can choose fried Betutu.

Bebek Tepi Sawah, this one of the most famous restaurant in Bali. The signature dish is Crispy Duck 🦆 hmmmm.... so yummy!","Cozy place with good taste of food and beverage also best service.
So many variant of menu with full spicy of course.

This Famous brand place is located at the central of town, but not far from kuta beach. Right place for hunted balinese traditional food.

The place is large enough and comfort, completely with galery that's sold so many choices of fashion, accessories, handycraft  and other things with good quality and inexpensive price.

This place is very good completely with outdoor sitting area with nice garden, also has a large parking area.
When I came here this place is quite enough, not many tourist come here.
Recommended.",Affordable price and large restaurant.. But if you want a quiet place isn't the good one. Live music is too loud I think

The 5 star review mostly fake i think","Nothing I found special at this hotel. The service was the worst ever, the receptionist called us by ""weeeee"" (which is sound very rude). Probably it's because we are local and  underestimate us. We know the hotel is cheap which was only 150k per night. We were searching for cheap hotel just for quick rest purpose.

Bed was hard, only 1 towel provided for 2 person stay (yes, we should share)
No toilet amenities (we understand)
Toilet flusher was broken
No hot water (shower was shown red and blue means should be hot water available)

One point is good was quiet place without any disturbance.","So dirty and bad room. No Towel, no Blanket, no Toilet paper. We ask for Towel and blanket. Get just the Towel, no Blanket.
Just the Outside look nice.","In the OYO app the price was 130.000, but at the Hotel 135.000
They did NOT want to provide a towel ?",Hotel asked me to pay more 50k instead because they said that oyo didn’t give the right price.how come oyo promote the hotel without agreement with the hotel?they told ua that oyo isn’t fair to them.you can explain to them so they will not ask any additional charge for next guest
