I was able to share a lot of time with the members of the team and it is with a heavy heart that I leave it, it is obviously a place that I strongly recommend, a great setting in the middle of the rice fields. I would like to thank all the team for all the moments, all the discussions and all the laughter. THANKS","They just opened earlier this 2023. For a cheap room, it is perfect. The morning view is amazing, and they even have a rooftop, in case you wanna enjoy sunset facing paddy fields.
They provide bare minimum facilities, but at least there are private toilet & shower, kitchen with stove, fridge & refill water. They also have laundry service for 15k/kg. Wifi also works fine.",This is the best Home Stay ice ever stayed at the room is very comfortable and clean. It has a very beautiful view. It has a sharing kitchen and you can ask for laundry services there. It is very convenient. I would definitely go back to this Home Stay someday in the future.,"Gending is a really good place !
It is in the middle of ricefields, and they get a rooftop üòä.

Gede, the owner, and Wayan, his workers, are really good guys !
You can ask them if you need to rent a scooter or if you need something.

Gede got a special Arak if you dare to taste üòâ.

It is better to rent a scooter cause the street over there is not really ""fun"" to walk, big holes in the sidewalk... and you don't get a sidewalk all the time üòÖ.

10 minutes scooter from the ubud downtown, so it is really quiet üôÇ.
Also, there are little local restaurants where you can eat well for a cheap price.

We had really good times over there !"

10 out of 5!!!!
Enjoy Bali!!","We had a great stay - the host and the team were super welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was a big plate of fruit, toast, eggs and coffee or tea. Loved being slightly out of Ubud town. The rice fields next door were full of fireflies and you feel like you're in the countryside but Ubud centre is a 10 min grab away!","Very nice place, located off the main road within fields and green area, with the very fair price. Nice swimming pool and garden. Rooms are fine including bathroom, spacious. Breakfast is fine. There is nice cafe with range of dishes and live music 3min walking. Location is a bit off the loudy Ubud centre, but good for having a rest in the pool and fields. Only disadvantage is that strange narrow path leading to the house next fro  the street.","Small guesthouse (only 4 rooms ). Rooms on the second floor have an amazing view of sunrise and sunset
The pool is nice and makes this area cozy
The room was very clean, with a comfy bed
Breakfast was very simple - but anyway, it's a nice bonus
All people, who works here, very welcoming and helpful

- The biggest problem for me was the noise from the main road, which is very close. the room almost doesn't have any soundproofing - so you can hear everything around. it was very difficult to sleep, and every morning noise woke up me around 5-5:30
- The area is not so good - far from everything, on the main road always traffic, usually you need more time for your way
- There are no cafes/restaurants around","The location is out of the city centre (about 20 min by scooter from Ubud), which makes the place really peaceful.
Pool is beautiful and room are nice and clean.
Price is really fair! The breakfast is a plus.
Would definitely come back!!"

But what impressed me was the collection of sarcophagi, really cool!
Highly recommended!","Basic, but interesting small museum. Mainly about sarcophagus. We had free private guide explaining everything and taking pictures, look is how the usually manage the visitors","The place is clean and well- maintained.

That said, the lights in the display buildings lights are so weak that one could hardly discern what is being displayed. The ACs are not working. Worse, the descriptive writing are old and faded, it is a turn off even for the most ardent enthusiast.

For the area's size and natural beauty, (yes still a beautiful place) - the collections are sparce and limited.

I suggest its admin to up their game and update their logistics as well as display.","The last museum I visited in 2019 for my research. I almost cried when I came here cause the museum staff are so nice!!! I really touched cause I came here alone to get some data and information for my research and they patiently helped me, guided me, waited for me when I needed to stop to document something. They exhibit archeological artifacts from Balinese culture. Even after my survey was done, they asked me to go to the canteen and have some snacks and drinks there. Best service!!! The minus is just the museum is located in the Gianyar and there is no GO-JEK there. Even the local ""ojek"" was hard to find.","Quiet and cosy museum, not crowded at all, but we really enjoyed the exhibits and location."

Coffee was delicious.","Ambience is good, staff is nice and polite but service is okayish. Food was not upto the mark compared to the price. we ordered Pizza which was very soggy bcz of either more sauce or it was undercooked. Coffee was bland, more water than milk, felt like i was drinking brown colored watery juice. Pasta was okay in taste but less serve size.","We had a quick coffee fix and chilling for the air-con

The rooms have a beautiful design as well. Staff is super duper friendly and the food tasty. They even offer a shuttle to Ubud market (It takes like approx. 15 min.)

This is a family friendly hotel and in the morning I was happy to see a couple of friendly chickens free range walking around the place .  The resort has a lovely feel and I really enjoyed my stay here. The ricefield views are awesome some of the best views I have seen in Ubud. The infinity pool spilled out onto these ricefields and it was simply glorious swimming in the beautiful large pool. I stayed in the large deluxe suite and overlooked  the trees and the pool.  The breakfast was excellent with fresh wholemeal toast and real New Zealand butter and home-made jam. It‚Äôs a very peaceful place and if you have work to do, all rooms have lovely wooden writing desks.  It‚Äôs a lovely stay.","I felt like they genuinely care about their guests. The room was clean and well maintained. The pineapple jam served with breakfast was delicious. It is located a bit far from Ubud center, which is perfect for a relaxing time in the quiet.","This place was worth every penny. Although located al little bit outside the center of Ubud it was perfect. It has a nice view of the rice fields, a great pool, good kitchen and dinning area and a big beautiful garden. The cherry on top of that is the house pet - a little turkey named Iam. Shortly after we arrived we became friends :) the place offers massages, tours, bike and motor rental... the whole thing.
