But the road to the hotel is very beaten and uncomfortable, swamp and scattered boards.  I came out of season and it is clear that the hotel is not ready to receive guests.  The hotel needs general cleaning and repair.  The paths near the hotel are littered, bird droppings are everywhere, even on the windows in the room.  The plumbing is dirty and not working properly.  The ceiling is broken, the surfaces are dirty.  The bed is comfortable, but in more than a week of my stay, the bedding was not changed.  I had to constantly ask for clean towels, soap, etc.  The room is comfortable, but it needs maintenance. The conditioner works badly, not cold the room properly and after you switch off it the ice is falling down from it. The kitchen is dirty. The staff is very friendly and there is also a very good dog in the hotel.  But they need to work on the hotel.","Great value for money, clean and well kept room, right on the beach. For the price, you can't beat a laid back resort that has its own private beach.  They even provide snorkeling gears for free to use. The breakfast and service is equally good. There is just a bit of frustration with the parking situation. Be mindful that the hotel is far from anywhere, so be ready with some waters and snacks.","Maybe it was a nice place and n the past but today I can‚Äôt recommend this place. The whole property is dirty and messy, most of the stuff is broken or not well maintained. The bathroom hasn‚Äôt been cleaned before our arrival and was quite disgusting. Even after we informed the staff nothing happened. Hairs everywhere, full trash bins and the (dirty) toilet wasn‚Äôt working at all‚Ä¶

The only positive thing is that the bed was quite comfortable.","Based on Indonesian hotel standard for a 2-stars hotel, Crystal Beach Bali's room and toilet are considered pretty clean. I love the high bed/mattress and the almost ceiling to floor windows.

Though the location is secluded, but it offers peace and quietness. Nice place to chill and away from the business which is less crowded in Candi Dasa compared to the southern part of Bali.

The only thing I have issue with most hotels in Bali is that they don't have hand towel and hanging hooks in the toilets. This hotel's shower water take about 5-10mins to heat up so I feel water is being wasted by letting the tap run for so long.üòÖ

Nevertheless, the price we paid for the service (very friendly staff) and the sea view, I definitely recommend this place to everyone.","This hotel is such a hidden gems. The room is standard, but what makes this place amazing is the private beach where you can snorkel. They also provide free snorkeling gears that you can use. Crystal clear water with a nice reef is a great combo. I hope in the future they can build more nice infrastructure."

The staff run the place as if it they own it and the service reflects that! The rooms, gardens and views are second to none and it is such a lovely place to chill out.
I could keep writing but what more can I say other than; turn up and chill, go for some lovely walks and chill, go swimming in the pool / snorkeling or diving in the sea and chill, drink beer, ok coattails etc. if you are a lady, & take in the view and chill, eat great food and chill and then sit on the porch of you room and take in the ambiance of such a beautiful place before sleeping and then chilling all over again the next day.
As a summary, I can only think of saying thank you to the SB staff and implore whomever is reading this to just turn up and chill in this beautiful place.
A big thank you to the SB team :-)","We only spent 1 night because the next day we had the boat to Gili Meno, but the place is charming and nice, the staff proved to be very helpful and welcoming, offering us a free upgrade in addition to the pick up service from the airport and since it was late, he allowed us to order dinner on the phone to avoid finding the kitchen already closed at our arrival. Thank you very much for your exquisite hospitality.","Great for this place. Love the vibes, garden, a lot of sea view with affordable price. The room is quite good. Cozy and very nice. Althought the wifi was lacked. Over all my families satisfied with the services and atmosphere. Thank you Sea Breeze..‚ù§Ô∏è","This place was an absolute delight.
Right on the ocean but quiet and cosy.
The rooms are very comfortable with cold air conditioning. The staff are friendly and attentive. The food is superb and the Bintang is cold.","Simply gorgeous! We loved our stay at Sea Breeze, complete with its stunning gardens and peaceful location at the end of a small, secluded road. Our huge room was clean and very comfortable, breakfast was delicious and the staff were absolutely lovely.

It‚Äôs possible to snorkel from the steps below the hotel, though be careful of the swell at high tide."

Would love to stay here if we can in the future, the facilities are beautiful like many in Bali but what is more rare is kind, understanding staff. Have heard many good things about this place!","Pros: employees are very kind and helpful, housekeeping is very good.
Cons: booked through booking and the manager sent us a link to pay, after we paid via link, manager told us they don't have the payment and sent us another link to pay again. So for two days we had to contact our bank, booking to see where the payment went. Showed hotel manager Ketut our payment confirmation and bank charge, yet they still wanted us to pay again. Until we called the manager and after some explanations he found the payment.

Room: The beds you can feel the springs, very uncomfortable. Outside the room were some parrots in cages and they start screaming around 5 am every morning, so had no chance of sleeping in. Asked to move us to another room, but manager Ketut asked for more money.

Other than that, the place is really beautiful and well kept.","First Thing why so many bad reviews here ?
i was make wrong booked. my booking date was weekday by my own mistake , but i want to go in the weekend. there no chance i can change the date because in booking apps the policy are no reschedule and refund included.
so i text the hotel , and they give me free rescheduling for the weekend for free .üòç

the rooms are clean , comfortable , yes the breakfast is not buffet but that okay .

the view and the pool worth the price .

so if you guys want to go here , just experience with yourself . these bad review came from people who pay less but want to be treated like a king maybe .","I don‚Äôt know why so many people complain about this hotel, we‚Äôve been in many hotels in Bali and this one is one of the best for that price. Deluxe rooms have a wonderful view, private beach is small but really nice and clear and all the place is sooo calm! üòç","Worst experience ever. You see all these nice photos, the pool, the sea. You pay 160 euro, booking the most expensive hotel in your trip, and they throw you at a room in the back corner, without windows.

Waited four hours (!) in the reception without solution from a staff member called Natasha, and a manager Ketut, terrible customer service. Take care and prefer a better solution nearby who will respect you for the money you pay them.

UPDATE:
4 hours later the owner asked us to pay MORE MONEY, in order to put us at the initial room we have booked and paid. We have found exactly the same reviews from previous guests (photo attached). We finally booked another nearby hotel, although we have already paid them, because we didn't accept to pay them more."

So quiet, simply house and easy access to the beautiful beach, just right in front of the bungalow. Spent the new year‚Äôs eve here was an unforgettable moment.","Amazing atmosphere, rooms and the place is in between nature, and beach. I loved my stay. Charge was a little high but it was a office trip, so office paid for it. Local market etc is not walking distance, which is the case for most places where you have such natural treasure. It's not a 5 star so the services was not like a 5 star but good.","Natural place with lovely artistic touches. Still has some of the special magic ambience of Bali unlike other resorts near by that feel sterile and disconnected.
Relaxing by the sea. If windy sea rough. If still paradise found. Wait for low tide. Food basic but good.","Today would‚Äôve been our 5th time coming to this place, obviously it‚Äôs because we love this place so much . Unfortunately today we had a very bad encounter with the receptionist, I‚Äôve never met someone so rude in my life with such poor customer service. the rest of your staff are so lovely except for the receptionist! Truly made us feel not welcomed. Very sad.",The bungalows are very nice. The location is great if you are looking for peace. The private beach is small but I liked it. In low season you can enjoy it as it was your own. Breakfast included is good but small and if you want one more cup of bali coffee they ask you to pay for it. For the price of the rooms I think this is not really fair. The food at the restaurant of the place was good but small portions. They sell good healthy juice mixes but too watery. Service is just okay. Overall I needed peace and it was perfect for this.

Food is delicious and prices are very good. Very nice and cozy garden.
There work the best waitresses I have ever met. Waitresses are very caring, attentive and cute. Thanks for them!","We visited the place several times in a row and we were always satisfied. The meals were just awesome and the staff extremely polite and very nice. Credit cards are accepted with 3,5 % (I think) surcharge but the prices are very fair. P.S.

There are just two wooden guesthouses that share an extremely nice pool and the house of the friendly and helpful owners. The whole place opened quite recently and everything feels very new. The stay included a tasty breakfast (I can recommend the Mi Goreng).,"I stayed at Wooden House Candidasa for 10 nights and I had a wonderful experience. The wooden house is cozy, spacious, and well-equipped with everything you need. The balcony offers a stunning view of the sea and the mountains, and the private beach is just a few steps away. The infinity pool is also a great place to relax and enjoy the scenery.

The staff are very friendly and helpful, and they provide excellent service. They arranged airport transfers, The breakfast was delicious and varied, and they also delivered food to my room upon request.

The location is perfect for exploring the nearby attractions, such as Candidasa, Tenganan, Tirta Gangga, and Amed. There are also many restaurants and shops within walking distance. The area is quiet and peaceful, and I felt very safe and comfortable.

I highly recommend Wooden House Candidasa to anyone looking for a unique and memorable stay in Bali. It is a sustainable and eco-friendly property that respects the local culture and environment. It is one of the best places I have ever stayed at, and I would love to come back again.",We had a wonderful week here! Lovely cabin with comfortable bed. Delicious breakfast served to the terrace in front of the cabin every day. Other meals from local restaurants can be ordered on WhatsApp at any time if you want to stay at the pool all day. Staff helped with arranging a rental scooter to be brought directly to the property and picked up at the end. Nice coffee places and restaurants either in walking distance or doing pickup. Hosts are really nice couple and very friendly. Wish we stayed longer!,"This place is like heaven! We stayed for 3 nights and had the best time, thanks to the lovely hosts MJ and her husband Robert (who can share such interesting stories of their fascinating lives) and their utmost friendly and polite staff. There are only two cabins for guests, so you always have someone to talk to but otherwise lots of privacy. The pool and the ocean give you plenty of options to cool down and both are just amazingly beautiful, not to mention the breakfast. I will always think back of this place ü•∞
Despite the calm area there are many very good and cheap restaurants in short distance. Highly recommended! Thanks for having us!","In one word: Amazing!
Just the most welcoming owners with kind and helping staff! Beautiful location, great hospitality, stunning view of the ocean!"

We had a flawless stay!! Ayu and the entire staff were the most welcoming and took care of everything.
We loved the peace and the homey feeling we felt during the three nights.
One of the best villa estates you can stay in Bali, highly highly reccomended!!!!
Thank you Iouri for welcoming us, we will be back!","Wow!!! This has got to be my best holiday so far and no doubt, it will be very hard to beat. We were a group of 18 and we had an amazing time at Citakara Sari Villas.  The staff are absolutely amazing. They treated us like royalty. Greeting us on arrival and departure, constantly topped up our drinks in the fridges and kept the place spotless. After a very short time, they became our unforgettable friends. The Villas are by far the most impressive accomodation I‚Äôve ever been to.  The architecture, the carvings on the walls, the furniture, the ornate light features and the unique baths made you want to sit the for hours to soak it all up. Of course we spent most of our time in the amazing infinity pool. You could easily just stay at the Villa all day long to enjoy all its fantastic facilities. Our beach was a great spot to snorkel in, we were even fortunate to be greeted by a local turtle. Chef Nengah cooked up the best meals and his desserts are to die for. You have to try his Chocolate Lava cake. Ayu, our favourite manager, was always extremely helpful, so friendly, forever accommodating and always willing to help arrange transport, day trips, bookings, party preparations etc. I will always remember her.  Thankyou Ayu. Be sure to ask her to arrange a massage on the premises. Unsurprisingly, it was extremely hard to leave this place, but I am already looking forward to go back to Citakara Sari Villas. It couldn‚Äôt come soon enough. Thankyou Citakara for everything.","We have just spent 10 nights at these villas (7 adults and 6 kids) and we have had the most phenomenal holiday!
The estate itself is stunning, the views are mesmerising, the villas clean and tidy, the staff all very friendly, great with kids and nothing was ever too hard!
Ayu is an amazing host, she was attentive, easily contactable even when not on site and her meals was extremely tasty!
Candidasa was new for us, and we have fallen in love with this lovely area! Peaceful, picturesque and we found ourselves discovering little gems every day (snorkelling spots, warungs, yoga, massages to name a few).
We found some fantastic nannies who our kids adored and they have already asked to have them again next time!
Thanks Ayu and the team, we will be back and we can‚Äôt wait!",Epic spot for a wedding. The Bridal Party stayed at the venue which we all enjoyed for the 5 days and then 50 friends and family gathered for the wedding. Fully catered with food and drink we partied into the night. A truly amazing place to spend time with Family & Friends.,"Beautifully authentic, dreamy and inspiring.... a truely exceptional place, with wonderful staff, great food, quality art/design and a very natural and welcoming environment.
