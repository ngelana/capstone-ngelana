We luckily stopped here but weâ€™re so glad that we did. The people were so sweet and lovely. The view was amazing and it was great to sit and eat great food with great view,"Hidden gem- we were so glad we stopped there for a quick lunch. Such a peaceful place with beautiful views. Staff is so polite, pleasant to speak with and food was top notch ðŸ‘Œ","Oh what a view, forget the main road going to or from bedugul.  Put this in as a way point and stop for lunch.  Food is oh so reasonable, and that view is amazing.  Add to that you stay off the main road and all those buses.  We will be back.","Loved this place. Just stumbled upon this place randomly, but I think itâ€™s worth every second. We got to feed the fish, have amazing coffee and enjoy the breeze coming in with a continuous waterfall sound soothing your ears. Do drop by ðŸ˜Š","Catu rest area is like the dream place you always wanted to live. Itâ€™s a really cozy stop by on a road through the mountains on the way to se Pura Ulun Danu Bratan. Itâ€™s must stop, te food is really great, prices are cheap and the views are exquisite. Thereâ€™s always Bintang around to serve you, she speaks English and itâ€™s very nice and cute. If you are planing to go Danau Beratan or just riding, go eat there."
