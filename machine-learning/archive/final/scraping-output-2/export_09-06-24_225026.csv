Tranquility atmosphere make you rest well. The simple breakfast also available. The cabin also clean, pretty and make you feel home. Surely we will come back here.",Only visited for lunch. Limited choice in the menu but the food is delicious.,"When you are in that area, this is the place where you can get food that is not only bakso or sate ayam.. the menu offers a decent variety, and the food is not too bad.. could be a little bit more fresh though.. nice and friendly staff..","Sub-par fare in a dining hall setting. It's pleasant enough, clean and quiet but the food leaves a lot to be desired. If they get your order right, it will take a long time. Even simple dishes like nasi goreng can take ages. Perhaps it was a slow day in the kitchen but the seating area was empty so it wasn't busy. Confirming the orders 2 or 3 times didn't seem. To make a difference, it took a while to get it back. If you're not in a hurry and don't mind mediocre Indo dishes, this might be a suitable place to take a break. Otherwise, keep going.","This is by far a great place that offer decent foods on the way / out from Gilimanuk harbor, only less than an hour. Surprisingly this little resort has great Indonesian food! We came by after a long journey from Java & intrigued to find good food on our way home to Denpasar.
We ordered soto ayam, nasi pedas, gado-gado & mie ayam, they were all VERY GOOD. portions make sense, good for Indo belly (lol:) priicng is okay, menu was quite extensive... The outdoor ambiance is nice & cool, they even have dedicated space for praying areas & very clean rest area.

Coffee was quite good, surprisingly so many different coffees from all over Indonesia!"

They have vegetarian options too. Nice atmosphere and good food. Staff is very helpful and accommodating.","Service Is good, waiters are kind and food is delicious. Recommended!",Beautiful view from the terraced dining area. However the food doesn‚Äôt live up to it unfortunately. They use lots of MSG. Food here looks and tastes like came from instant food. What‚Äôs you see in the photos on the menu are very different from what you actually get.,"Mantab!!! Nice view, nice services, thanks to the PIC on the phone, I make a call last night at 00.00 and the PIC still answer my call, and the result was awesome!!!","Located on very stategic spot not too far from Gilimanuk port, this resto is quite popular for travellers heading from Gilimanuk to Denpasar. Easy to spot and has enough parking space to accomodate 5-10 cars. Very clean interior, and service was fast. Taste was average nothing special, but lack of proper resto on Gilimanuk - Denpasar road (except for bigul/roastpig resto) making this resto obvius choice for moslem travellers. There is a nice resort hotel on the back, but we didn't stayed there. Maybe next time we visit here again. Recommended."
