Fresh and delicious red snapper for only 100k with rice and vegetables for 2 people. It was so good that we went there 3 nights in a row. The family that runs the place is super friendly and welcoming. Dessert was yummy as well,The only place open in the surrounding. The lady is extremely nice and the service was really quick. Value for money is great. Considering you are in the middle of nowhere we were really happy - fried veggies were relatively excellent.,"Incredibly nice, family run place. The fish I had was above average in quality and came with home made sauces, not something usual around here. Burger was ok, but get 2 if you are really hungry. Spring rolls were hand made, unfortunately not seasoned at all and the (probably) home made sweet chilli sauce wasnt strong enough in taste. Alltogether nice place, especially value for money!",Lovely family-run place with great fresh food and prices. Delicious noodle soup for just 20k IDR and mains for just 30-40k IDR. Recommended!,"People are super nice, food was amazing, many vegetarian options. Would recommend to all me friends and would come back again!"

We stayed here for two nights and liked it a lot.  Friendly and service minded people running this place. The food is also good and for a reasonable price.,"We stayed in the Griya Tama vila. The experience could not be better. The place was very nice and clean. The staff was excellent. They were very helpful and friendly. The food in the restaurant was pretty good, from the tasty banana pancakes to the fruit, spring rolls, club sandwich, and noodles. Location was also good, very close to crystal bay and not far from the harbour. They also rented us two motorbikes.","Absolutely stunning place.

We stayed here, ate here, and had multiple experiences organised by the MORE than capable host, Gede.
We were a group of 4 friends and this was such a wonderful place! Even a trip to the pharmacy prior to a Manta Ray diving trip was no problem and swiftly arranged.

Breakfasts were the best and we loved the Balinese coffee. Smoothie bowl highly recommended.

Dinner excellent, had burgers and wraps and boths were excellent.

Attention to detail immaculate. We loved wvery minute. Thank you.","Let me tell you about the best restaurant on the island. The food is amazing and you can definitely taste the love in each bite. We had breakfast here every morning. Omelette and pancakes are a hit. For dinner i recommend getting the gado gado , a must try. The chicken satay is peanuty and delicious. 10/10 definitely recommend","Great place, lovely people Gede and his wife .. A cute and cosy room, near the harbour. They helped us arrange the snorkelling tour. They have bikes for rent too.. A pick up and drop to and fro the harbour was also arranged by their team . A great place to stay if you are looking for a reasonable price.
The only thing we missed was a swimming pool ..
May be that can come up soon.."

Also great bungalows, comfy and cozy bed. I couldn‚Äôt say more positive things about Nyoman and the atmosphere he has created. He is a wonderful human being inside and out. Please make this part of your journey when in Bali. Much love to Nyoman and his family :) ","Fantastic please, clean and big rooms. The owner is really kind. Breakfast is ok.
As it is a bed and breakfast, not exactly the best place if you want to socialize, but still really recommended.","Absolutely gorgeous rooms, lovely quiet location but can reach everything easily on the scooter.

INCREDIBLE BREAKFAST!!

Asian Food: The best dish was the Tom Yum soup with steamed rice. If you like Asian food, you should definitely try it.

Western Food: We also tried the spaghetti bolognese and it was amazing.

Other Good Eats: We liked the mie goreng, nasi goreng, and desserts like churros. The cocktails were great too.

Service: The people who work at Red Chili are very friendly and make you feel welcome.

Location & Prices: If you're staying around here, Red Chili is the best place we found to eat. The prices are a bit more than a regular warung but very affordable with a lower price than most restaurants.

They don‚Äôt add a service charge, so you can tip the staff if you‚Äôre happy with the food and service.","Great location, excellent service, great ambience!

Welcomed by the staff with a great smile.
Ordered our drinks & food. Had the mocktails, Penida Good Day & Mango Mint Lassi. Very refreshing!

Food, we had Seafood Tom Yum & Salad.
The tom yum... IMPRESSIVE! Taste sooooo good! We even talked about it after we left the place. And the salad dressing is yummmeh~

The wait staff came to check on us & ensure that everything is well.

I must say that the team really put in alot of effort! From the beautiful food presentation (very instragrammable, Haha!) the beverages & overall experience is just AMAZING!

Thanks for the perfect dining experience which made our day! We'll sure to come back the next time!","We were dining there for 3 nights, the food is great and the staff were really friendly and kind, especially the waitress who was singing the songs from the radio!üçï","This place is amazing!

It was really expensive to buy anything, even after bargain for a long time.

The wooden carvings are amazing. I met a fabulous person (a woman traveler), which made the experience perfect.",Very chill. Amazing food (especially the chips/fries and spring rolls). Reasonable price.,Fruits and juice are good to have it here not the food.. they don't even know to prepare a simple omelet and scrambled eggs it tastes weird and in this room they don't provide water bottles everyday the only one day of check-in they give u two small bottles of water.

Most authentic style cooking as well. The food was always delicious and great portions. Oh and cute pups too :),"Best place to eat around. The food is delicious and even though is not a fancy place, you can enjoy a tasteful dinner. Price is super good too, and owners are gentle. We ate there 2 of 2 days we were in Penida :)",Happy to find a local place finally! The food was suuuuuuper good and good prices! The family was friendly :),"Food here is delicious and adorable, around 25k per dish. We didn't have to wait too long for out food. As other reviews said this place is not a tourist trap and will charge you fair prices.

We've got Sate Ayam (chicken skewers with peanut sauce served with sice) and Mie Goreng (mildly spicy noodles with egg on top).","The most authentic food (little bit spicy) we had so far on Bali & Penida :)! Food is amazing & prices as well.
Friendly guys took care about our veggie preferences and also served Gado-Gado without having it on the menu. You should stop here"

I've lived in penida for 3 months and this new cafe has quickly become my favorite cafe so far, thanks to its exceptional food.

I ordered lumpia and fried rice, the lumpia here is a true delight. Crispy on the outside and filled with a flavorful mix of vegetables and spices, each bite offers a satisfying crunch followed by a burst of savory goodness. It's served with a tangy dipping sauce that perfectly complements the rich flavors of the filling.

the fried rice is equally impressive. Cooked to perfection, the rice is fragrant and loaded with a generous mix of fresh vegetables, lots of seafood and a blend of aromatic spices, making it a must-try for anyone that's visiting Penida üíô","Very good restaurant run by locals.
Good food and service.
If you need more flavour on the meal, ask for side spices, they bring you hot ones!","Very nice new place to eat. The staff is very polite and sweet. They put the effort to make a beautiful plate, taste great! I orderd the traditional rendang but instead of rice i asked for french fries with the dish (you should try it!). My sister had the cap cay with chicken and rice also very nice. As a dessert we had pisang goreng (banana fritter). Definately recommend this place!","We stopped at that place for lunch and had an incredible time. The food was amazing, the staff is very nice, we received a free desert for my friend‚Äôs birthday and a free coconut for the opening of the restaurant. They removed the meat of a salad to make it vegetarian for me. The chairs are also really comfortable and it wasn‚Äôt too hot thanks to the fan.
