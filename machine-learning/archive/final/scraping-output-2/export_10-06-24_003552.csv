We rented the main villa and a bungalow for the kids. This place is magic, close to an awesome beach and with a beautiful garden. Frogs, birds etc...Close to a certain idea of paradise.",The house was beautiful and the beach is not far. Would definitely come back,Beautiful palace and own friendly and good teach for tour bike,

The accomodation is in an unexploited and quiet part of Bali, on Balian beach. The surrounds feel untouched and genuine, it is paradise. The villa is taken care of by three staff, Maya the housekeeper who makes daily breakfasts and keeps the property beautiful. Johnny the gardener and Kadek the all-round superstar who is happy to assist with whatever you need. He arranged day trips, scooters, massages and pedicures (served at the villa!), sim cards. He recommended many great places for us to visit. He is just a Whatsapp away whenever you need.

The villa itself is the height of luxury. Expansive space, beautifully furnished, amazing attention to detail everywhere you look. The infinity pool is perfect, you can easily spend the whole day on the the sun lounges and bamboo recliners outside. Also the bathrooms the size of a 2 regular living rooms with a bathtub and incredible shower. Incredibly comfortable beds. Everything has been thought of.

We absolutely loved our week-long stay here and cannot wait to return.",Excellent accommodation,Private beach,Beautiful!!!!,

We have enjoyed our 2 days stay at this villa. This villa is bit far away from main road and shops. And to reach villa, roads are not good.
I would not recommend to transport from this vila to airport as its far away from airport.
There is few scary experience as its near the beach you can see big geco. Ladies might get scared.
Otherwise look and location is perfect.
Service is also good.","Amazing villa, looks exactly like the pictures! Clean and tidy, Ketut and villa staff are very friendly. Villa inca is really good for a getaway from the busy parts of Bali but still being able to eat and drink cheap. We were able to order meals to be delivered to the villa, or the surf camp has a restaurant 5 min walk away, the main village is on the other side of the river, unfortunately we weren‚Äôt able to cross it with high tide, but Ketut was always very quick at replying and sorted out transport for us to the village, sushi surf is a really good place to eat there! As well as many other eating places! Each morning breakfast was made in the villa and we sat outside and ate yummy eggs, toast, or Banana pancakes ! Remember if you are going to this villa to take all the drinks and snacks you need as there isn‚Äôt a main store nearby.","Rebecca's place aka Villa Inca is an amazing place to escape to and is, as described before, reminiscent of what I'd envision the 'Old Bali' to be of say the 1960s and 1970s maybe.  My wife and I came to Bali for our Honeymoon and spent the first 3 nights of our trip in Ubud which was great but we were yearning for a more laid back place and found it here!

Balian Beach where the villa is located is a very laid back chill surfing village where the pace of life is slower and chill is the operative word.  We checked in late, maybe around 9PM / 2100 local time but Villa manager Ketut was great and helped us out!

Ketut made us breakfast every morning which was fantastic and was adaptive to our schedule and needs.  For instance one day we made a side trip up to Menjangan Island and had to leave real early the next day i.e. 630AM and he just told us the day before he'd show up at 530AM, no questions asked - just did all things. He is also super helpful in coordinating drivers and is just a great guy all around.  Shout out to driver Nyoman who took us up to see Aling Aling waterfall area (very cool side trip by the way).

Other attributes about this villa that we really liked was the infinity pool which was just great, in fact at least two days of our week long stay here we just chilled at the villa all day and did nothing but lounge around in the sun and went swimming when the equatorial sun became too hot!  Also, the local neighbor dogs, Tiger and Satu, were super sweet and would stop by and say hi to us most days which was nice because we missed our pets while traveling.

There is some pasture land adjacent to the villa which was nice to look at and there was a herd of some Balinese cows which would meander around behind the property.  Seeing them juxtaposed against the Indian Ocean while we chilled in the infinity pool is a iconic scene that will be hard to forget.

We recommend checking this place out if you can!","If you want just to have chill out and spend wonderfull time relaxing - the villa is perfect place for it. The staff is brilliant, very helpfull and hospitality - thank you for your time !!!
Close to the villa (5 minutes by scooter) there are some restaurants (with very good food).
We really recommenden Warung (close to the villa) where Ayo prepares delicious Soto-Ayam or Gado-Gado.
This year 2018 we also spend summer vacation in Villa - it is just brilliant place !!! Ketut - than you for your hospitality, kindness and help - you were always on time. Thank you for great food (Soto Ayam, GAD-OGADO, Es Campur)
Nest year we are more than sure that we want to come back :)",Beautiful villa. Ketut is great and cooks great breakfast. Nice view. If here on a Honeymoon get the Seafood Banquet

Weyan comes every day and takes care of the Villa, services the rooms and kitchen and also coordinates all other requests you might have (driver & car, chef to prepare meal for you in the villa, etc.).

They thought of everything. It is super comfortable: the bed, the sheets, the couches, the kitchen: everything! We loved the BBQ in the outdoors kitchen which makes a great spot for a pool BBQ under the stars.

We have been so lucky to find that place (for little money).

The owners offer different tree houses and one cottage with 2 bedrooms, which we have chosen for us. Each of the bedrooms has a private bathroom. There is one kitchen that is shared. You get laundry service and can also rent scooters.

The rooms are basic but nicely decorated. You see that the owners put much love into it. They have been so helpful and kind. They have little shop at the end of the street where you can buy food, beer etc. We really enjoyed our stay. That's why I am so detailed with this article. Hope you enjoy as we did!

On AirBnB you can find them under: Hidden Paradise at Alam Balian","Stunning homestay  in the middle of a patch of jungle and rice paddies, perfect if you need to chill away from the hordes of mediocre beer guzzling tourists. At walking distance from Balian Beach, one of the best lefts in Bali. Amenities include Jason the House Gekko (the chap is the most efficient pest removalist ever), heaps of butterflies, surf and motorbike rental.

Most importantly, the owner Ketut manages to be always there without ever being  intrusive -a man of countless skills- establishing a beautiful atmosphere of friendship that never feels fake, different from  other ""feel good vibe"" places where, scratching the hippy, one finds a cash register.","Real balinese homestay, ketut has built an experiential paradise at alam. Prices are extreamly affordable, there is a range of accomadation for those wanting modern luxuries rather than truely balinese experience.",Nice place surrounded by green scenery. The surf break is at 5 min walk. Friendly owner. Clean facilities. Recommended.
