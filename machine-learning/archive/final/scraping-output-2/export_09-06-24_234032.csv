It has lots of window lights. Loved the balcony as well. The pool is a bit too deep but it has a gorgeous jungle view.

Located about 3 miles from the main road so the resort is a peace of mind. There are many café, convenient stores, mosque etc along the main road. Rambut siwi Beach I just another mile from the main road.","Wonderful hotel, excellent service and amazing location
Fell in love with the view
We even canceling our plans and stayed a day longer because the hotel was worth it
Thanks to Made and Putu for the good service","Ersadeva  is a beautiful resort set amongst a forest of coconut palms and exotic tropical plants.
It is a wellness resort, so the emphasis is on healthy eating and lifestyle in tranquil surroundings. The staff are totally dedicated and  provide A1 service. Remember though Ersadeva is a wellness resort and doesn’t cater to boosey raucous customers.
Positives
Staff excellent.
Individual cabin style accommodation. Comfortable, clean and air conditioned.
Nice warm pool
Spa and massage facilities
Restaurant ( vegetarian).
Wifi
Negatives
No fridges in the rooms!
Lots of steps. (Well it is a wellness resort)
No Tv. Radio, coffee making, telephone
Rail around pool, seems a bit less than sturdy.
Closest shop within walking distance has very limited stock

Summary
Our group (12) were attending a local wedding and had the pleasure to be the first customers to Ersadeva which was not fully operational at the time. Most of the group enjoy a beer and had a good time without a problem But I am led to believe that down the track Ersadeva  will have a no alcohol policy. Don’t  quote me on that. Do your Due diligence if it concerns you. Smoking I think will also be frowned on.
We had three days at the resort . And generally it was an interesting new experience. I doubt if I am likely to visit again but that’s because I am not a young person  and have dodgy knees. I also enjoy the occasional beer.
So check it out for yourself. It might be the door to a better lifestyle.
