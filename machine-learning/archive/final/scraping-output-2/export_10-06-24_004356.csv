Friendly staff n great hospitality by the owner.
The place is massive n great to relax. There are many cosy corners within the resort to chill. A great place to recharge though it is located in busy Ubud area. The owner had put in much effort in making the place relaxing.","Beautiful place to stay. So much culture and an exquisite atmosphere, especially as you wander through the gorgeously lit gardens at night. The staff are excellent - they go out of their way to help you.","My stay at the Arma Museum and Resort was truly memorable. The villa with a private pool was a dream, offering stunning views of the surrounding rice fields. The hotel's traditional Balinese architecture and decor added to its charm, making me feel immersed in the local culture.

The highlight of my stay was the hotel's museum, which showcases the works of local artists. The collection was impressive, and I was amazed by the talent and creativity of the artists. It was a unique and enriching experience to explore the museum.

The staff at the hotel were exceptional, providing attentive and friendly service throughout my stay. They went above and beyond to ensure that I had a comfortable and enjoyable experience.

The location of the hotel in Ubud is excellent, providing easy access to the town's attractions and offering a peaceful retreat away from the hustle and bustle. The amenities at the hotel were excellent, and I particularly enjoyed the food, which was delicious and beautifully presented.

Overall, I highly recommend the Arma Museum and Resort to anyone visiting Ubud. It offers a perfect blend of traditional Balinese hospitality, luxury accommodation, and cultural experiences that will make your stay in Bali truly unforgettable.","We were there for lunch and to look through its art gallery museum. Lunch was lovely as there weren't many people dining so it wasn't crowded, service was excellent and we had crispy duck which was delicious. The museum got better as we wandered through all its heritage buildings of art pieces and gardens. A peaceful place.","Incredible heritage hotel. You'll step back in time...roughly early eighties. Deluxe garden room comes with exactly two sockets (next to the bed), a tiny 'office' desk, no proper chair, a nice big window with a nice big gap for the evening arrival of mossies; Also a gorgeous, yet small terrace, which is taken up  mostly by the two oversized sofa chairs. Two small bottles (250cl) of re-filled filtered water are given each day, any more is charged. Water pressure in the upper floors is just about sufficient to shower, the fridge full of ice (attached to the freezer compartment) and the safe comes from the future (latest Assa Abloy model, big enough for laptops). The whole place is stuck in time, which depending on your outlook is either good or bad. Location is bang in the center, with at least three entry/exit points to the outside world. Noise from the streets is barely audible, and rooster and dogs are unheard of. Breakfast buffet was also rather heritage, top of the range sometime in the mid eighties. Staff make up for the (typical Balinese) inefficiency by being very friendly and happy. You want big rooms, a sprawling garden with fountains and rivers and ricefields with a distinct 80's ambiente, Perfect. Just make sure you don't pay more than around 70US$/night"

Perfection then?

Unfortunately no. It‚Äôs very surprising but curtains are not opaque at all and being waken up by too much daylight at 6 am is such a disappointment.

For this particular reason, I do not recommend this hotel unless you are an early morning person.","Recommending this gorgeous place! We got a booking short notice even though their annual holiday was coming up. The reception and room service staff is extremely helpful and friendly. I suffer from coeliac disease and the restaurant staff did their best to accommodate my dietary restrictions but we ended up buying gluten free bread and bringing it for breakfast. The rooms are beautiful and spacious with a lovely view into the green. I really recommend the pool and pool bar, it was very relaxing and fun to be around that area. They have shuttles coming making it easy to get into the center of Ubud. If you visit Ubud this resort is an excellent place to stay at.","Staying in Green Field Resort Ubud on my birthday was the best decision. The F&B staff brought out a birthday cake during breakfast. I have never had a birthday cake for breakfast. It was a pleasant surprise. It truly made my day. We enjoyed the¬† breakfast set. It comes with a juice, fruit platter or fruit bowl. My daughter enjoyed the chicken porridge. Throughout our two night stay, the hotel staff from the office to the spa were lovely and all smiley. Our rooms were well furnished and clean. Clean bedsheets and bath towels. Glad to see glass water bottles instead of plastic were provided. I enjoyed sitting on the balcony watching the birds. As the hotel was not busy, the hotel shuttle was able to take us to Yoga Barn. Thank you for making our stay  pleasant and memorable. Also, not forgetting the lovely birthday surprise in my room. A highly recommended hotel to stay if you are looking for a quiet and relaxing stay. It is hidden away from the busy road.","We stayed only 1 night here but everything was good. The resort offers tea break (tea and cake) in the afternoon and buffet breakfast. The room is nice and clean with a big bathtub and they even prepare bathing salt for you. The spa was very relaxing. All the staff was very helpful and kind. However, the wifi quality is not stable sometimes.","I have checked on the reviews before deciding on greenfield resort. As a seasoned traveller, my minimum expectation is clean towels, and sheets fitting which sadly, the hotel didn't managed to provide. Both of this essential items came with sweaty dog sour smell, something like cloths soak in water and not properly dried. We didn't complain because it was just 3 night stay, and was even disappointed that during the 3rd night, my used cup wasn't even changed or wash (I have lightly washed it but would expect housekeeper to change used cup for hygiene purpose.) Whilst we understand the importance of saving water and not to wash the towels regularly, the resort only changed our towel the 2nd night and skipped the first, there isn't any tagged to inform us on this. Expectation is to change towels daily and if guest agree, it can be changed on the x day guest preferred. Cleanliness really needs improvement."

We ordered Spesial Pisah, the portion is very generous. If you are not a big eater, I suggest sharing instead.

The staff was also very honest with us, their pork skin was fried. Overall it was a very good meal.","Still the best Babi guling in Bali. The meat, sausage, skin was enak
We came around 1pm and the place was packed. They found us a seat and we enjoyed a good meal.","Find another place! This tourist trap is not recommended.

We came in around 4pm and they told us they were out of the crispy pork skin and traditional vegetables to which they offered to replace it with pork crackers and radish (cheaper alternatives that is also common with other reviewers).

This was skeptical as they told us they place was so packed earlier that most items were out of stock, However the place was completely empty (also common with other reviewers).

The service was quick but the dish was served cold and the pork itself was not as tender as the last time i had it 7 years ago.

Do not order the juice beverages as well, as they are diluted with water.","We came to this restaurant which is quite near the villa we were staying at while in Mas Village in Ubud, Bali. Babi guling is one of the iconic food in Bali which I wanted my family to try. Apparently this is the 2nd time for me to be in this particular restaurant. I was also there before the pandemic, when I first went to Bali.

Food was good. Although my family found the food quite spicy.

The place hasn't changed as far as I could remember. It has this oldish feel which I think needs upgrading.

Pool time rules, you can't go there whenever you want to, just between 7am and 7pm, or, in other words, the pool is available when you are outside enjoying your day.","Do not believe the  high star reviews you see here, most of them seems paid to me.
I tried to stay in the hotel but it was nightmare.
So I booked a hotel and checked in and immediately I realised that the hotel is not what it looks in the photos.

I can go on and on and on but here are few things that you should keep in mind

1)No Hot water at all in all the rooms (Yes all rooms, so initally I was given the room on the first floor 105 and then upon complaining me they shifted me to room no 305) but yes no hot water in there either.

2)Very noisy and not able to sleep, the location of the hotel is on a road and the you constantly get the noise from the passing vehicle, and if you are lucky you can get the room like I was offered where there was a constant noise of drilling from the next door (wont blame hotel for the drilling) but yeah it is very noisy.

3)Insects  - there are insects and red ants and cockroaches are everywhere in hotel (I stayed in August 2023 where it is a dry seasons)but all the rooms has this issue.

4)Rooms - Rooms are extreamly small and not maintained at all.

5)Staff- the hotel staff (not the management) but the reception staff is bit humble and polite but they have no control over anything

I initally booked hotel for 3 days but it was so disater that I checkout early.","The staff were super friendly and attentive, always going out of their way to make sure I had a comfortable stay. One thing that really stood out to me was that they allowed me to store my food and beverages in their fridges since there wasn't one in my room, which was really helpful. The room itself was clean and comfortable, with everything I needed for a great stay.","I've booked 2 double rooms in here 6 days before arrival to the hotel. Surprisingly I found that they provided me 2 rooms with twin bed!! So I had to negotiate to get double beds which I was told they are not available and after further negotiations I was told that the manager agreed to upgrade me to deluxe rooms but I have to pay extra 50k per room per day. After further negotiations I was given the rooms with no extra charges.
So overall first impression was not good.
The staff is very friendly. They agreed to show me the place on arrival. The rooms I got had a good view. The room area was good with a balcony toward the swimming pool. There was no much toiletries here so bring yours. Towels unfortunately were not changed daily! The breakfast starts at 7-10 am and it's good. I liked having it in the rooftop deck with the good breeze and great view but after 2 days I was told I can't have it there because they can't provide a staff up there to serve me!! (Thumbs down)
Don't order any food except breakfast, I had a burger and pasta for dinner and it was the worst. The restaurants are nearby the hotel and you can choose. The gas station and the mini market is 8 min walk from the hotel. The staff once was nice to take me to one of the restaurants at 11 pm on his motorbike.
Overall:
Very Friendly staff
Not very good service
Comfy rooms

I wouldn't go back to this hotel again."

Don't be fooled by the front store, as there are nice seating arrangement Bali Style, a traditional interior design.

There are two option of meals, one typical pork mixed rice with all the Balinese ingredients and special made chilly mixed. Or you can have it as kids portion where no spices added just the rice with the pork meat.

The price is 25K for the normal portion and 20K fpr the kids meal version.","The first restaurant we tried once we arrived in Ubud and it did not disappoint. The food was absolutely delicious yet very affordable.
They only have 3 things on their menu: mixed pork rice, mixed chicken rice, and mixed ""vegetarian"" rice; perfect for indecisive people like us. Each chicken/pork variety in each dish was so flavorful yet complemented each other somehow.
We also tried the es jamur; an iced mushroom tea that's similar to kombucha. It became my partner's favorite and ordered it every time we ate there.
The shop may not look like much from the outside but they have these beautiful and peaceful dining area in the temples inside.","Hi! Hi!
If you are looking for one of the best Balinese mix rice , this is the right place to be. Don't get fooled by the looks of the restaurant from the outside because they provided a great place to sit inside. Today , I tried mix rice and the chicken rice. Both of them are good , especially the satay. Love the sambal , its not too spicy and I think most people can enjoy it. Don't forget to order their orange juice , very refreshing!","really like the vibe of balinese home while eating here. there are three menu of nasi campur, chicken, mixed (chicken and pork), and vegan option. cash only payment. definitely need to be on your must visit local culinary list!","Since 1963. Recommended for nasi campur, chicken or pork. Authentic balinese home cooking.
Based on reviews before, I think service is improved now and price also good.

Serving slow-cooked vegan goodness, everything here is top-notch. We ordered Nasi Campur, Curry, and Gado Gado, all of which were delicious. The banana cake was alright, albeit a little dry. Their black coffee is intense and flavorful too.

Enjoy free WiFi while waiting for your food, or simply set aside your devices and enjoy the peaceful greenery of the little courtyard. You are in Ubud anyway.","üåøüç≤ Siboghana Waroeng - House Of Mandala Ease: A Hidden Gem in Ubud üçõ

Tucked away on a quiet street by the river, Siboghana Waroeng is a hidden sanctuary. Venture upstairs to discover a gallery adorned with art and mandalas crafted by the owner's father. This tranquil spot also hosts cooking classes.

Specializing in traditional Indonesian vegan cuisine, the food is freshly prepared with an authentic touch. The prices are refreshingly accessible, reflecting the homemade goodness served. There's a small table on the first floor offering a fantastic view towards the kitchen.

This is not a place for those in a hurry; instead, it's a haven for those seeking a peaceful atmosphere paired with exceptional local fare. The portions are generous, and their sate is, without a doubt, the best I've tasted in all of Indonesia.

For spice enthusiasts, you can request extra sambal. If luck is on your side, you might get to indulge in their delightful desserts. The beautiful garden adds to the overall charm of this culinary gem.","One of the best nasi campur in Bali! Tastes super authentic even though it‚Äôs vegetarian. I love the nasi campur so much, especially the crispy mushroom! It takes them more than 15 minutes to serve because they‚Äôre all freshly-made which is amazing. The staff are super friendly and smiles a lot! Always come here around 3 or 4 because it‚Äôs not that busy. It‚Äôs also a very nice place!",The best vegetarian food in Ubud. We liked it so much that we came here two days in a row and we tried almost half of their menu ;D everything was super fresh and tasty. And we waited about 20min for our food both times. Definitely recommend this place!,"The best vegetarian food I've tried in a long time. Their food was even one of the main reasons I came back to Ubud.

The best dishes for me: the siboghana soup, the fried noodles (no comparison to other fried noodles you'll find), and the banana cake (even though they seem to have changed the recipe, it was better before) üòç
Also, most of their dishes, they put fried mushrooms, which are really tasty as well!

The only dish that hasn't been so great had been the pumpkin soup - same price than the other soups, but much smaller.
Talking about prices, this place is so cheap for the quality you'll have.

The ambience is amazing, it's just far enough from the main street so you don't hear any noise, and when there's no one, you'll just hear the birds singing.

This was my favourite restaurant in whole Bali, thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Very clean and friendly

They have a pool too and their another property is overlooking the rice fields which is stunning. Both the property is a walk away from lush green fields","The room was very moldy. I got sick for a week after sleeping in there for 2 nights. But the owner was very friendly and put me into a much nicer room for the rest of my stay.
It is a big plus to have a pool and a kitchen for that price. However the kitchen is pretty gross and very poorly equipped. And the pool is not in the same property as most of the rooms. It's just a 3 minute walk, but you have to go out on the street.
Free drinking water and coffee was also a nice thing to mention."
