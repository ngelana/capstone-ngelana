Clean area and cover by trees too.
There's drivethru service.
We were on road to Gilimanuk, seems like this restaurant is one of the last two McDonalds before Gilimanuk harbour.","Good service, humble staff and helping. There are cute cat and fast wifi. This is my over all favorite McDonald in Bali. Definately will come again.",Food was relatively quick done. Everything was OK. I try the special one burger and it was delicious.,Classic mcdonalds. Fast and nice staff. Everything OK.,Need morr self order machine. But overall this McDonald is Clean & Fast Service.

Sorry to say all of the food we ordered were quite blandüò≠ came with group of friends and they were experiencing the same thing.
However, had to mention the place was comfortable and the service was excellent!","Attractive 2D interior, both on the 1st and 2nd floors, accompanied by coffee and pizza at affordable prices, makes chatting even more fun.","I left the caf√© with a contented heart and a satisfied palate(coz I wasn't expecting the food to be good). It was a delightful experience, and I can't wait to return. The minus 1 star just because they need to fix some of the table,so it will be more stable. If you're in search of a cozy and welcoming caf√© with delicious food and exceptional service, I highly recommend giving this place a try.","More of a hyped place, really just a regular caf√©, with unbearably screaming running children, the food and drinks are good, especially the different flavors of smoothies, I recommend them","My friend recommended me to visit this 2D theme cafe and I went there after the lunch time with my friend.

The staff is very friendly and helpful. When we went the second floor, we started to smell something fishy and mouldy. We assumed it comes from the paint or old vinyls. We told the staff about it and spray air freshener but the weird smell doesn‚Äôt go away

The food and drink is okay. We ordered pizza and smoothies + tea. It took quite look time to get the pizza ready and we almost drank our drinks. Maybe that‚Äôs their strategies to persuade the customer to order more drinks.

But overall, it is a nice cafe."
