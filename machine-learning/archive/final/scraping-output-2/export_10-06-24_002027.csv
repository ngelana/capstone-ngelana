Nice pool, clean and cozy rooms. Restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food is good but nothing special. All in all a great hotel in a remote location.","We had dinner here while we were staying at Eco Bamboo Island and I must say their food was better than where we stayed. At least it was edible. They were expensive, though. In Canggu we eat at nice Italian restaurants for the same price. But at least we didn‚Äôt starve while being in this remote location.","We had an amazing experience staying at this resort during Nyepi. It's a small and humble retreat that offers the perfect opportunity to disconnect from the world and immerse yourself in the serene greenery, with breathtaking views of Mount Agung from every angle. The staff treated us like family, and their hospitality was exceptional. Everything about our stay was wonderful. Just a heads up: being so close to nature, we encountered some insects in the room, so it's a good idea to bring mosquito spray if you're prone to insect bites. The food had a homely taste and was delicious. Highly recommended for a wellness retreat or a healing getaway to reconnect with yourself.","Great value and great view ! The staff was so nice and always so helpful also thanks to NIA for helping us with everything l ! My partner is especially coeliac , they made the meals gluten free and made us feel safe to eat it here and stay there for 2 nights! Hopefully they will have a gluten free menu soon ! Also the room has a water bottle that's a plus and the air-conditioning is great üëç","Stunning views, friendly staff and nice rooms

BUT

Food is almost inedible. Pancakes were both raw and burnt! I looked it in kitchen and it's so filthy I checked out early

Also they ruined all of my clothes in the wash"

The facility offers quite a pleasant stay at a good price. You should be aware of the location, there are really few shops or restaurants around that you can find in other parts of the island. It is a perfect place to relax, enjoy the wonderful sounds of nature and beautiful sunrises and sunsets. You will also have to deal with small fauna. The hotel staff is very nice, polite and hassle-free. Willing to support and help, but not overbearing. The food served in the restaurant is delicious, but it's a pity that the portions are quite small.","BEAUTIFUL! We absolutely loved our stay here, it is probably the best place we‚Äôve stayed at on our travels in terms of the room, the pool, the view! We were lucky to get the top room next to the restaurant and the views of the rice fields are just incredible. There is a kettle, water,& tea/coffee, and hairdryer in the room, the bed is so comfy and has mosquito net although we never got bitten anyway.

The only bad things: the room allows things to get in, in particular big lizards which are soooo loud in the night waking us up multiple times with their mating call, this is because there are gaps at the top of room and bathroom has an open wall (see pic). Also, the restaurant charges a service fee which is weird considering we‚Äôre guests here.","The views are stunning!
The workers are lovely and really polite. This is the perfect place to relax and connect with the nature.
If I would have to say where there is room for improvement would be the general cleaning on the restaurant could be better.",Amazing staff. Great size room & bathroom. The views are beautiful. The food is well priced. The pool is big looking into forest.,"Certainly, here is another negative review for Sweet Escape hotel in Sideman, including the issue with the old blanket:

My experience at Sweet Escape was a complete disaster. The staff were unprofessional, unhelpful, and rude. They seemed to have no interest in providing a quality experience for their guests.

The condition of the hotel was appalling. The rooms were poorly equipped and badly in need of renovation. But the worst part was the old, musty blanket on the bed that had clearly never been washed. It was at least 20 years old, had no sheets on it, and had been used by countless other guests before me. The blanket was full of old hair and dead skin cells, which made me itchy and uncomfortable throughout my stay.

There was no wifi in any room and the lack of basic amenities made my stay uncomfortable. The overall atmosphere of the hotel was gloomy and depressing.

In conclusion, I would strongly advise against staying at Sweet Escape. The lack of professionalism, poor amenities, and unhygienic conditions make it a terrible place to stay. Save yourself the trouble and look for other options in the area."

From the moment we arrived until the day we left, Kadek went above and beyond to ensure our stay was nothing short of perfection. Her kind, caring, and accommodating nature truly made our experience special.Thank you, Kadek, for making our stay an absolute delight!","We've had a very nice price for a last minute booking. Not too far from Sidemen, it's quiet and you can do nice walks like to a nearby waterfall. Staff was very sweet.
Only - point, the place wasn't really clean (and I'm not a difficult one on this)","I stayed here the night before I hiked up Agung. Komang, the owner is very friendly and has a huge pride in his place. The grounds are very well looked after and the rooms are massive and very comfortable. I didn't get to experience the place fully as I had to leave at 1am but from my experience I can highly recommend this place. Close to nature and beautiful scenery","Terrible service.
1. I arrived, there was no one there. No people or owners, just empty. The door and gate are closed.
2. Ok, I called the owner, he said he was out and started giving me instructions in broken English-Indonesian on how to stick your hand and open the gate, how to find his villa.
3. Two wifi and both don't work. The owner texts me in Whatsapp, I'll figure it out and nothing happens. Network E does not allow you to have dialogues with him in watsap.
4. The villa is very cold and there was a simple sheet on the bed. The blanket is in the closet, but dear friend, make it yourself.
5. The pressure in the shower is weak, there is almost no hot water.
6. The light is very dim, it is disgusting to be there, not even a book to read.","Would definitely comeback if i need to stay overnight in the area, beautiful room and warm. Kind service as well as good room price at the time i stay, Cleanliness is not great thats why i have to take one star off. There was some sprt of animal excrement on the floor i didnt see it when i check in as we came a bit late . But all good"
