Our guide warmly welcomed us and provided an informative tour of the garden, explaining the cultivation process. The complimentary tasting of around 15 different coffees and teas was a great surprise, and the flavours were exceptional. The reasonable prices at the shop made it easy to bring home our favorite blends. The picturesque view of the mountains added to the overall charm. Highly recommended!","We stopped over here to try the Luwak Coffee.  When we got out of the car, we were very nicely accompanied by a fluent English speaking guide.  He highlighted the 2 main coffee cherry trees found at the compound (Arabica & Robusta) and how they were different. Then he led us to the coolest animal ever found on the island, a Luwak or a Palm Civet Cat.  To end the tour, we were served samples of the different kinds of tea and coffee produced by Baturiti Coffee company.  The coffee, tea and visit was so lovely that it made my day!",What an amazing spot!  All the samples were delicious.   Free taste samples.  Beautiful scenery.  Nice store.  Friendly staff.,"This place is an amazing find! Everyone here is so friendly, helpful and they speak very good English!! They taught us all about the plants that grow and how they make the coffee and tea and what goes into it. We were able to taste lots of tea and coffee which tasted amazing and the views there were so lovely! We purchased our favourite tea and coffee and even a bracelet so that we could share the flavours with everyone back home! Absolutely loved this place, thank you so much!!","Absolutely amazing staff and atmosphere. Widi was very kind and walked us through the whole process from plant to plate. We are not huge coffee drinkers but we had to try their entire range. Needless to say, we loved it all. The teas were spectacular as well, and prices were very reasonable. Definitely check them out if you are in the area."

The bad part was the staff used her hands to get the meat and skin and put on our dish! 4 dishes, all hands. then the plates were delivered to our table with the fingers all oily and shiny.","Just an okay food, portion is big.
