We arrived and they offered us some tea and carried all of our luggage to the bedroom. There was a website with a variety of activities and tours u could do and the staff booked a tour for us last minute. We also rented a motorbike from them. The food and service was also amazing. We recommend this place 100%! 😊,"An adorable place with just one shared dorm room. It’s clean, spacious and calm with comfy beds.
The view from the balcony is lovely and staff is always helpful & friendly.
The café downstairs is also great.
Short ride to Munduk waterfalls and generally good location to reach other sights in the area.
Highly recommend 💗","Clean dorms and nice comfy beds, great hike nearby you can do without a scooter. total of 7 travellers stay here, so it’s quite a small hostel. I think munduk will probably attract more backpackers in future, good place to escape the hustle and bustle of Ubud .
One suggestion id give is emailing guests before they arrive with the guide to the hostel/ area which was really useful and has info on the trek","Lovely place with very welcoming hosts. Dorms were clean, lockers were secure, and the view is great. The cafe food is really good too!","Nice hostel, the dorm is clean and bed are comfortable. The view from the dorm is beautiful as well. The family is really friendly and they served good food
Thanks 🙏"

The pool is tucked away inside a wall of trees, which means you can't get close to the pool after a swim, but on the other hand, each villa, most of which face the pool, has a huge garden where you can relax.
The staff are extremely friendly.
Near the hotel there is a small warung that opens at 10am and closes at 10pm, but if you want another one, you have to walk a few kilometers.","A big thank you to the whole team of this hotel who took care of our family, the children were in paradise and even did a fishing activity on site, basketball, badbinton.

Congrats and thanks 🥋","The location and views are fantastic. Friendly staff, scooter available, 10 mins ride from restaurants in Munduk. The whole Munduk region is gorgeous. Negetives: the rooms are fine but not so spacious, and, surprisingly, no aircon (in our 45 Euro/night room) which is unusual and was quite sweaty!"

Putu was utterly gracious and and offered to take us to the nearby waterfalls and walk us through  the jungle back to the villa ,recognising that we were new to Munduk and not aware of the time ,location and km's our intended track would take .
Nadira Villa is the place to stay to explore Munduk. A sanctuary from the elements and brilliant staff. Friendly and extremely attentive.  Fabulous location . Our adventure in Munduk was made all the more memorable by all at Nadira Villa Bali. Regards Ivone & Nigel","We had a fantastic stay in Nadira Bali villa during our stay in Bali! The location is great, even if a bit remote from Munduk village. We had a private Villa with our own pool, facing the beautiful jungle! Amazing view and relaxing area!
The staff made our stay fantastic, from the warm welcoming up to the “details oriented” greetings every day! The restaurant and breakfast are nice, with some decent food options in a beautiful environment (facing the jungle). The staff even gave us some chocolate beans from the garden!","Very friendly service. Great food, nice views and good value for money. They organised a wonderful dinner for us in the villa and decorated it beautifully with flowers.  Fantastic massage therapists and car service to take you to Munduk Moding Plantation and resort for the day or for longer transfers.
Not a huge amount of hot water and the steps to the restaurant may be a little difficult for those with mobility issues."

The place was very clean, calm and relaxing. If you like nature and beautiful sunsets you should definitely go to Da’Kayu !","A fantastic place and fantastic people, thanks to Doni and his family.

It is very quiet here except for the muezzin calls at 6am, 12pm, and 6pm that last 5min.
What really made our stay unforgettable was the amazing service. The owner is the kindest and most helpful man you will meet! When my bf got sick during our stay, he changed the morning breakfast to something he would like more, offered to pick up medicine for him and asked about his well-being everyday. If you are missing something from the room or have a request, don't hesitate to ask!

Munduk is a great place to experience the authentic Bali, to go trekking in the Jungle, see waterfalls, go water rafting and do canyoning. This also means that there are no tourist shops, no party night life, and ""tourist restaurants""only Balinese food. Just be aware before you come here.","I returned here after a 4-yr gap, and Munduk, (unlike Ubud), has been hard-hit by Covid and lack of business:( BUT HAPPILY :) Karang Sari finally answered my calls, and are open and THRILLED to see guests return🤸‍♂️👌👏🏼👍.

We tried a number of different vegetarian dishes and they were all exceptionally delicious! All freshly cooked and beautifully presented. After a few visits, the family offered to cook a couple of different Balinese veggie dishes for us to try off the menu which was very kind of them. Tofu pepes was the best 😋

We loved the selection of desserts on offer and tried all of them over the course of our visits. The black rice pudding was our favourite ❤️ Free welcome tea with ginger and pandan leaf was great too 😊

The view to the trees in the valley is lovely both during the day and at sunset.","Best Warung in Munduk, perhaps all of Bali! We tasted many local Balinese items on the menu over several visits and struggle to say which one is best. Very fresh ingredients, delicious flavours and lovely atmosphere. Nested in the jungle, to the sound of Balinese music and river further down, beautiful surroundings and very friendly hosts! Highly recommend! :)","We already travelling 3 weeks in Bali an try a lot of good warung with good rating , but this one is the best , food so nice and delicious , big portion .
