ChIJP0D2vGiR0S0RdbFcm7GinOo,Rostika Hotel & Camping Sekumpul,-8.1677549,115.1874802,"Jalan raya, Sekumpul, Kec. Sawan, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81171, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=16905565984941453685,OPERATIONAL,+62 895-3411-29651,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.9,82,,"The hotel is in a quiet area very close to Sekumpul waterfall which is amazing! There is a beautiful sunset view from the hotel. As it is a bit far from everything else it is good to have a scooter to discover the area.
The room is nice and clean with good bathroom. There is a smart TV and good WIFI (however the system is not the best as you have to log in each time you want to use it).
Restaurant could be better, they didnâ€™t have a lot of things from the menu and breakfast was very limited as well. For example instead of big breakfast (eggs, tomato, sausage, bacon) we could only order omelette or scrambled eggs. Also, please notice that there are taxes that are not included in restaurant.
Service could be better as well, the day we arrived we didnâ€™t have any toilet paper and trash bin was full. In restaurant often we had to take the menu and order at the counter because nobody noticed us.","The room is clean and simple. what more else needed? the best thing about this place is its environment. you can walk to the Sekumpul waterfall (20mins to ticket place). if you follow the road up to the mountain for about 5-10 mins by scooter, you can see wonderful scenery. And there's short trail behind the hotel, takes you to small waterfall (quite artificial thing thoughðŸ˜…) I loved to walk there so much. The most I loved is watching stars at night. there are some places has no street light around the hotel. I could see uncountable stars there. I was really happy while watching stars. only downside is that you may wait for your order in the restaurant because not many staffs are there. but it was okay for me because all staffs are nice even when they are so~~~~ busy. I wanted to extend my stay badly but i couldn't for some reason. I hope i can come back here someday.","The hotel was located some distance from the town in a calm, quiet area, with a beautiful view of the mountains, the village and the coast in the distance. There is no shop nearby, you have to get there by scooter. The room is not very large but has everything you need for a comfortable stay, clean, efficient air conditioning, comfortable bed, nice bathroom. The hotel has a beautiful restaurant, a large parking lot and a beautiful swimming pool. Very nice service, helpful in every topic. After making the reservation, the hotel recommended contacting the driver Made, who organized the transport from Padang Bai to Rostik - it is really worth working with him because he is very reliable and a good driver. The hotel is located near the phenomenal Sekumpul waterfalls. It is also worth going on another trip - northern Bali offers many different attractions and the hotel staff or Made will help you choose. I would love to go back there because I had a great time there.","It was so good from the arrival, the staffs welcomed us with highly friendly attitude. The room was so clean and, unexpectedly,  they even provide Android TV.
The pool was clean and the breakfast was much tastier than we've expected.","A great place with very friendly and helpful staff. The breakfast was fantastic. The room itself was a great size and very modern. I like the seating area outside the room on the public walkway.

They told me there is also a camping area, where you can really feel surrounded by nature. Especially away from the surrounding lights of other buildings. I want to try that when I come back to Bali again.

The staff really helped me out as I had a loose side mirror on my scooter and they fixed it in the morning before I checked out.

The only issue I had was that the TV reception was unavailable due to location, and you must use the internet to stream the channels."
