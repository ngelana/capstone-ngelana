Eat here with a local Balinese person to understand what are the best things to order because the menu is tricky when trying to translate to another language!!
My favourites are the grass jelly/coconut milk/palm sugar drink, the seaweed salad, fruit salad and peanut/green beans/rice cakes dish.
Watch out for the spice levels!
Very much worth the experience of eating here despite lack of air conditioning and many flies attracted to the sweet (and spicy) dishes!","Craving for any local snacks and drinks during the hot sunny day .. Well, Warung Men Runtu in the Sanur area @ Denpasar, Bali is the perfect spot for the local snacks (ice, rujak) but not the place to chill. They have so many varieties of snacks  to pick and choose from. Try ordering their Ice Daluman, Freshly squeezed orange juice (Es Jeruk) and Es Campur; are the perfect choice to quench your thirst, and to soothe the spicy üå∂chili's effect after eating the Rujak Kuah Pindang. I felt refreshed after having their Rujak Gula Bali, Es Daluman, Es Jeruk and Es Campur üòÅüòä",Had so many Balinese dishes here. Fresh and delicious with local prices.,"One of the best kept secrets of Bali, Warung Men Runtu is tucked away on a side street just outside centeal Sanur.  This unassuming eatery serves authentic Balinese dishes, and consistently delivers a huge variety of great food.  Their salads are excellent, but their seaweed based salads are exceptionally fresh.  We have not come across an English menu at this warung yet, but don‚Äôt let that put you off, fire up your google translate and let the adventure of taste begin!","One of my favorites place and viral on social media. This restaurant provides Balinese dish such as rujak, tipat catok, plecing. The favorite of this place to eat are fruit and seaweed rujak with fish sauce paste."

They provide a water fountain within the room which was excellent ! Short walk to the main street/shops and this the beach","We booked here over Christmas as the other resorts were too pricey. The apartment is huge, the rooms were clean and beds were comfy. We had a nice balcony over looking the pool. The kids rooms were big and they had loads of space to chill and relax.

The kids club area was quiet and staff were always kind and helpful. Food here is expensive but we didn't stay long so wasn't a huge issue.

The front road is insane, hubby and I did walk it one night and I'm not going to lie, my heart rate was through the roof in fear.
The back alley leads to the main streets within a 5-10min walk, but you do need to be back by 9pm as they close it for the night then, which sucked. Grab is cheap home though so that's always an option, just annoying as we like walking as it's most of the time so much quicker.

All in all, I think this place was awesome!","Really happy with this hotel. Rooms were clean and huge, service was excellent and facilities were great. Recommend for families and extended families if wanting to holiday together. Highly recommend. Food was nice although a little expensive especially dinners.",Great hotel with very spacious rooms. Staff were great at all times and especially when it came to making our toddler happy. We all loved our time there so much we are going back again this year.,"Rooms are very spacious, spot on for cleanliness, and staff service A1, pools and grounds really nice,  great amenities.

Cozy, clean, and humble staff..
You can find Taekwondo, pickleball, etc..","I have been exercising and organizing  community fitness facilities (that include the development of fitness centers) since 1996. As such I always worked out with the head trainers and over the years have collected much knowledge while acquiring many good friends. Anyone who uses a trainer knows they are more to akin to friend, therapist and fitness facilitators. I can say without question that Arya, Liga Lead Fitness Head is all of the aforementioned.

He is competent, patient, fun to be around with a wonderful character. He is a trainer and friend. My favorite hours per week are usually spent in his company. What is unusual, as a trainer, is how Arya always stretches me properly after each session for 10-15 minutes without fail. He sees this as part of his responsibility which is a blessing and is quite rare as a personal trainer.

I believe his holistic approach, commitment to training (always using different techniques to avoid mundane repetition); and biological understanding of strength, stretching and cardio development puts Arya in the top 1% of his craft. I‚Äôd follow him anywhere on the island and happy he‚Äôs with a great company close to my house like Liga. Cannot recommend him and his training enough. If you‚Äôre in the market for a trainer he is your guy.","Best Sport Club in Bali for me, well if you‚Äôre living in Sanur or Denpasar area. Not only tennis but many choices of activities for children and toddler as well, getting better and better.

Recommended",Super nice tennis club with friendly staff and good facilities. Most importantly courts are well maintained but super fast and bouncy. Obviously it‚Äôs warm due to the climate so bring towels and have fresh grips on your stick. Locker room is super clean and I always saw someone cleaning around the club. Gym is well equipped and they have a cool pool area to cool off after a session. Was lucky to get some nice Liga merch to wear back home as well.

The room was OK, big, with good air-conditioning and hot water. We decided to book another night on Agoda because we were too lazy to move, and the price was double.

It was very relaxing and quiet considering it was just off the bypass. The rooms have a safe. They are comfortbale with a large bed which was firm but perfect for us. The gardens are beautiful and lush. The pool was very good and quiet whilst we were there. It is a bit of a walk through the back streets into Sanur but easy to navigate.

My fav food here is its meal menu that consists of fried tuna jaw and tuna soup. The fried tuna jaw is superb! It is tasty and the texture is smooth but chewy at the same time. While the soup i think it uses Balinese style bumbu or spice mixed called ""base genap"" but not really sure. it is served with white rice so get ready to have a full and delicious lunch.

Highly recommend Pacto to anyone planning a vacation to bali!","Worst experience with Pacto service as these people will never respond to you in case you are in trouble.
Lot of communication gap with the driver which lead to worst trip in Bali.
MMT should actually take care of such people","Our association with Pacto is via MMT(Make My Trip) for our Bali trip.
We booked for 7 days activities with Pacto from the day of arrival to the day departure.
They took care of the entire trip and made our holidays memorable.

The itinerary booked with MMT and inturn with Pacto was also communicated to us by Pacto well in advance and they sent out all the details.
What stood out for us is our guide and the driver.

Few stand out qualities of our guides, Mr Nengah Antara and Jao
-Always on time and approachable
-Never hurried for anything and always accommodated our requests
-Helped to plan the activities for the days which we didn't plan
-Whenever we didn't like the restaurants at times, without any questions they took us at the alternative places and made us comfortable at all times.
-Never asked any extra money for anything and they are extremely friendly, helpful and most importantly reliable
-Our guide even offered fruits from his garden multiple times

Their commitment and  association with amazing guides and drivers/vehicles is really appreciated and most importantly the people who were with us Mr Nengah Antara and Jao, thank you for making our trip memorable.

Lastly, there is always scope of improvement, especially keeping some water, snacks on the day of arrival, associating with MMT for other places like Nusa Penida, not sure why MMT has booked with other operator for Nusa Pendia and our experience was not so great with that operator. Providing the guide for all days(except for the places like Bali Safari, it is understandable not required) etc.","We planned out trip to Bali through MMT & Pacto was the agent there who took us to our tour everyday. Such an amazing staff. We were provided Mr.Julientara as guide and must a very polite & humble person he is, driver provided was also very humble. They were always on time wherever we needed to go according to our itinerary.

I went there for brunch and did some readings. It was very cozy and chill, although as expected, during the lunch time they do have heaps of customers. It‚Äôs fairly new cafe in the neighbourhood said the lady who works here, so they still have ongoing promotions. I had a breakfast package, Balinese chicken curry for lunch, and coffee. Definitely worth to try. I enjoyed my time there, thanks.

I rarely notice how a restaurant arranges their menu booklets but this one, is surprisingly informative.",Seems like a chill place for meals and comfortable for working too. It is also pet-friendly. We went here for breakfast and coffee after a run. This can be an option for a working place for some other time.,"I visited Braya quite a few times last year and was always happy.
This week I had an urge for eggs benny and have always really enjoyed  them here.
A group of 4 of us visited for brunch and it was a disaster.
The waiter could barely understand us and every time we ordered an item he would consult a list of items on the front of his order pad. I can only presume this was a list of unavailable menu items.
Eventually we had placed our order for drinks and 5 minutes later the waiter arrived to inform us that the fruit juice my wife had ordered was unavailable
We then ordered food and after a long wait the waiter returned to inform me that there was no salmon to make the eggs benny!
I then ordered scrambled eggs on toast.  After another longish wait the waiter returned to inform me that they had no bread for toast??!!. At this point I gave up and just had my coffee. The strange thing is that less than a minute away was a shop that sold bread.
The food itself was fine although my wife's chicken salad could have done with a bit more chicken.
Ar the end of this debacle we went to pay and despite the staff being told the restaurant was offing a discount for 4 or more guests they said they knew nothing about it and insisted on charging full price. We eventually got the discount when we persuaded the staff to walk outside and check out the offer clearly stated on advertising sign.
All in all, a frustrating and unpleasant experience.
Won't be back and would definitely not recommend.",Hidden gem! There are both nice ac room and outside area. Food/ juice are delicious. Good music and friendly staff. There is no high chair. Highly recommend.,"Very spacy cafe with decent prices! You can pay by card as well. I tried coffee, pancakes, profiteroles and tofu, and all of them were very good. I will certainly come back!"

But when i go inside its very good atmosphere and warm welcome from staff. There is two menu for lunch and dinner, love the taste. Will try another menu next time.","I have been here but it was long time ago, a decade ago. And yesterday was just a flip of decision and decided to visit Yamato on my way to Sidemen.
The dark interior, outdated exterior, and a bit odd smell is a bit depressing, but that quickly fade away when the food arrived.
The food is still as delicious as I remember.
Still so good and yummy and quite reasonably priced.
Will definitely go back here again!","Best Japan5in Sanur. I know the place thanks to Taguci! He's the guy in the pics!
Mks banyak",The pork cutlet is too dry but Sushi is good.,"We‚Äôve literally just paid & left this place and are writing this review now in complete shock at how awful this place is. We are not normally ones to moan but I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend this restaurant to anyone. As has been mentioned in other reviews the service is shockingly bad, neither of the waitresses spoke English which made ordering difficult especially when we didn‚Äôt want certain things in our sushi. The two waitresses stood around staring at us & giggling & when our sushi arrived it was of course all wrong & when we pointed this out they just stood there again chatting rather than trying to fix the problem. At that point we got the bill & left. The edamame were ok, everything else was shockingly bad including the service. Please find a better place to eat than come here, it‚Äôs not worth your time or money."

They offer typical point-what-you-want nasi campur selections and some ala carte options as well. Prices are affordable, attracting both locals and foreigners. You can dine in if you can bear the heat, but we always opt take aways. ü•°","This place is amazing and so fresh if you eat there around 11:30-12 noon! All the coffee options are always tasty and sometimes they have coconuts!
I love all the vegetables they have offered! The tempeh is always wonderful!
This side of the city always surprises me, I love it!","Such a gem! They serve home-cooked dishes, fresh and kept warm, and taste delicious. The price is also super affordable. I wish it was closer to home so I can eat there every day.

Now they have renovated, the place looks better and cleaner. The price goes up a bit.","We discovered this on our last full day in Bali. The food is really tasty and authentic. The prices are hard to beat also. The Indonesian food was great, as were the sweet pies. The eating area is nice and airy. I'm glad we found Warung Ayu."
