The location is in the middle of the rice fields and you get a great view of the Agung volcano as well. Room was clean, confortable and relaxing. Breakfast is delicious and you have a local night market nearby where you can try local Balinese food for dinner.

On top of that, Sandi is very welcoming and will teach everything you need to know about Balinese culture and spirituality. We did the sunrise tour and I would recommend to do it as it‚Äôs an experience we will forever remember. Sunrise, breakfast at local market, walk in the rice field, meeting locals and more. 10/10!

Thank you again, we hope to be back one day üôèüèº‚ú®","You have to know that this is not a 5star hotel. But if you don't need the luxery you can have here a nice time und visit the area. The owner of the place will help you to get what you need for that.

And he offers a really interesting tour through the village and the ricefields. Must do, if you are there.","Amazing place to stay in East Bali, loved it! We booked for one night and extended for a second one. The room is simple but cozy, very clean and comfortable with an amazing outdoor shower. Sandi is the best host, he makes sure you have the best stay, he even fixed the falling license plate of my scooter without me even asking. His wife cooked one of the best Mie Goreng we‚Äôve had.  Finally it‚Äôs a very close and convenient to a lot of must see attractions like Pura Lempuyang, Tirta Gangga, etc.","Let's say it frankly, you don't go to LinKeesHome for the comfort of a 6 stars hotel but rather to go and directly help Balinese people, to understand their life, to share good discussions about the history and future of Bali. Sandi used to be a guide so he speaks very good English and has lots of experience.
The room and bathroom are simple, the walls are thin, but important here is that you share an experience of living with real and generous Balinese people. Settled in the middle of ricefields, the place is easy to find.
I definitely recommend this place. This should be part of your discovery of genuine Bali. Just go there and have a real experience with local people !
After this pandemic, they need us.","This place is so lovely, clean and comfortable. But the best part is the owner, we sat with him for hours talking about everything, he helps so many people and taught us so much about Balinese culture. I cannot express how grateful I am to have learned so much, you must stay here."
