ChIJp5LEk-6H0S0RKWGYKH70A1o,Alango Farmstay and Warung,-8.3020433,115.07996249999998,"5 Jalan Sd Negeri, Gesing, Banjar, Buleleng Regency, Bali 81154, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=6486296711027777833,OPERATIONAL,+62 813-5325-7291,farmstay,"farmstay, lodging",5,12,,"I recommend this place to those who want to disconnect and enjoy the forests of northern Bali in a rural area.  Also to those who want to live the experience of sharing with a local family and enjoying their food.  From here we could visit nearby waterfalls, the view of the Twin Lakes and a spectacular sunset from our room.  Our stay at Alango farmstay was very welcoming thanks to Gede and his family.","What a beautiful corner of the world! Alango is a true retreat into the Balinese mountains, perfect for some peace and solitude or, and a great base for the trekking and waterfalls around.
The host, Gede, is a great guy, you really feel welcomed into his little world. His cooking is awesome - nothing fancy, just fresh, homely local food, and I loved wandering into the farm looking for fresh guavas to snack on, and herbs for my tea! The accommodation is back-to-basics but very comfortable, exactly what you want really from a hideaway-type farmstay. I could have stayed a lot longer than just a couple of days","Alango is like no other place I have experienced when visiting Bali! From the serenity and sense of calm you immediately feel when entering the property, to the connection to nature when wandering around the paths of their massive food forest, to the magical hiking in the surrounding mountains. Gede and his kids bring such a family-touch to the whole place and the food they serve is true local, balinese and picked straight from the garden. It is a farmstay with simple design, but each time I have visited Alango I leave with a smile on my face, feeling a deeper connection to everything around me and within myself. I highly recommend visiting this place when traveling around Bali for a different experience you won't get at any of the normal tourist spots!","Alango is a great place to stay. Locals were always preparing us local food, you can have a walk around the farm to see all the fruit that is around and the view with the sunset is breathtaking! Also, around the area are many places to see, I recommend waterfalls.
Had a wonderful time with friends. ðŸ™ƒ","A place where you can stay hidden in the forest with an incredible nature, a wonderful sunset and many places to visit, waterfalls, rice terraces, coffee plantations. The best is the local people, Gede with his family, the local food and the friendly people."
