The journey is absolutely tired but I must say to you, its worth it.
The scenery along the destination is so beautiful and the air is so different from the city center.
Actually its like donation 10k for the enter and the saroong, coz Pemangku insert the money for the donation box.
The aura of this place full of peacefulness
Give the charge positif energy, honestly i don't wanna back üòÅ
And the toilet is so clean, its cleaner than some hotel budget, i think üòÜüòÜ
Uppss forget, there is also Swan Garden near the temple and parking area.",Very sacred& beautifull PURA in Kintamani..i think come in the afternoon is the best way to get gloomy pictures..lucky for you if you come and find some Balinesse pass to pray..,"There are many incorrect reviews and pictures here. This small temple is Jati Batur which is situated inland and NOT the one bordering the lake. There is an intricate gate on the inside with nothing much else to see. When we visited, a sarong lady appeared and we rented from her for (IDR 20k/pax local price). You can use the sarongs to visit both this temple and the lakeside one (Segara Ulun Danu Batur). The entrance fee which was by donation was paid at Ulu Danu Batur temple which was 2 mins further drive.","Stunning lake and mountain view. The temple itself has a majestic and somehow poetic entrance.

Simply beautiful and soothing.","Lakeside Pura in Kintamani.
Quite silence, calm and nice view.

You must wearing scarf or sarong, but no worry if you dont prepare, they will provide and we pay for the rent, IDR25K"

When I went there during the day the rocks were very hot. If you want to enter, there is a sincere payment in front of the stall","Early morning trek to the top is amazing and indeed tiring, it's cold on top, so better to carry a jacket. And a pair of good trekking shoes is a must as the descend can be very slippery due to loose lava soil.","A very hard to access place, but the view and place was awesome. If you want to go there, better book an off-road car as access road was not that great. And be careful of local scamers who are finding opportunity to charge you some entrance fee for taking photos with stolen official receipts.",Magical place in Bali! Batur and the Lake with lava,Amazing Hike and sunrise!

And i would say the experience is pleasant. I booked the night before. Gus fetched us in the wee hours of the mornin from our hotel and guided us the whole time. He came well prepared and everything we missed out, he had, like blankets. He was super friendly and also very good at reading the room, he gave us the space when we needed it and was there when we needed him to be. Not to mention his photography skills, it was superb. I dont think the experience would be as memorable if it wasnt for Gus. Thanks bro!","I was skeptical at first regarding this tour as I was worried how they will take us to the Sunrise point. But Adi my man, he picked us up from our hotel in Ubud and in no time we reached the first start point and then we climbed to the top. It was one of the best and memorable sunrises ever seen. I would recommend this guided tour and they take care of you, your photos, they even help you with the poses and edits.","Very nice trip and nice driver .
Highly recommend üëç",Nice to visit‚òòÔ∏è,
