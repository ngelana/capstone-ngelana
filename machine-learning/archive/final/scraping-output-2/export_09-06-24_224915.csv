Restaurant food was good. Our villa was nice but had a couple issues.
Overall a good stay and would recommend.",This is the best place to stay at Mundak. It is traditional themed stay with farms all around. Staffs are very friendly. Food was also so good. You should try their home made jams especially the strawberry jam. Its so delicious. Rooms were also big enough and neat. Over all had a wonderful stay there.,"Atres Villa was just a one night stop for us, but could easily become a longer stay for people that seek peace and quiet.
The staff was caring and helpful. They upgraded our room free of charge. It was spacious and clean. Our terrace was literally on the edge of the rice field.
The food was good and the common spaces were comfortable.
We rented a scooter in-house which was really convenient.",We are so happy to have stayed here in the rice fields. The room was clean and had a view over the beautiful garden. The staff was so friendly and very helpful! We enjoyed a Balinese massage and did a cooking class (even got to go to the local market!) although we weren‚Äôt very mobile (we don‚Äôt drive the scooter) we could still see a local waterfall and the village. We would definitely come again and highly recommend this place.,"Old-school type ""villas"". But, quite well maintained. Very comfortable mattresses. And, fresh, crisp bed linen.
The service we received was very good, from friendly staff.
The views are nice (if your room is on the 1 floor). The only real problem is the one car wide access road - (at the time of writing this) incredibly broken! Washed away by monsoon rains, exposing huge pieces of stone and rubble. Almost impassable on a scooter. And, although an experienced rider, I wasn't going to attempt it after dark. A car, with good clearance, and if taken at a snails pace, could eventually make it. One would just hope not to meet a car coming the other way!"
