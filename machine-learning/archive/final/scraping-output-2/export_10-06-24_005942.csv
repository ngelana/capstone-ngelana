the shower works even it took a while to heat up...
also i think they need to keep the water dispenser on, so the guest can get hot water to make coffee or tea without waiting.
overall, it's a nice place to stay","Hotel sense is like private home. The hotel staff is super friendly. The rooms are spacious and comfortable for staying with family.
Definately will come back here....","A very good place to stay at Bali. I always stay here when I have duty at Bali. Frienly staff, clean, wide parking area and a pool.",Is excellent. if you want spend low budget and with comfortable room and tv and air conditioning with just 100k,"room oke, staff ramah"

The place is cozy except for the constant traffic in front of the shop.
The staff is nice.
Unfortunately they were not able to make stuff with ice cream nor the smoothie bowls.","Seli and Bella are the best employees of this coffee shop, when they cook breakfast for me, I am absolutely happy because they do it very tasty. The coffee is excellent, the food is excellent, you need to get to these girls to understand what I'm talking about. I have eaten here about 100 times and each time is unforgettable.

Food was good & they serve good coffee!
The staff are friendly & helpful. It's gonna be my new favorite cafe/coffee shop to go üòÜü´∂üèº","The first rule of ""bamboo by Kopi damar"" - never talk about ""bamboo by Kopi damar"". The second rule - forget about the first rule and listen to me, because this place is simply amazing.

On the first day of our visit, we took a risk and tried the Asam manis, and it was a delicious choice. But on the next day - bam, we met Ayam kungpao. Seriously, it's just an unrealistically delicious dish, like culinary ecstasy.

And you know what? This establishment is capable of preparing dishes without spiciness, if requested. Finally! Sometimes you want something soft and gentle, not always hurting yourself with spiciness. Okay, if you're used to spiciness since childhood, there's no problem. But there are people whose stomachs work differently, and they simply can't handle spiciness. I understand that for some, spiciness is like air, but there are also those who can't handle it. Sorry for being rude, but it's true.

As for the restaurant itself, I can say that this place is a wonderful balance between anarchy and order, a perfect haven for anyone looking for taste and coziness.","We go there for kids to play in the playground. We had grilled chicken and pisang goreng.
Good food, good coffee and fresh juice.
Service is good.
Very affordable price.",Wings were phenomenal with a great sauce. Cheese sticks were good but wings were definitely better.

I really enjoyed my time living here. The pool is beautiful, the place is gorgeous in a local area, about 20 minutes north of Canggu. I would stay here again because I loved it so much.","Umasaih is a definitely amazing place to live in Bali. And apart the place itself (it's so quiet, comfy and spacious), the owner and Shri and staff that works here are incredible people. Shri and owner organized for us cool cooking class where she shared many unique and interesting things about Balinese culture and cooking itself. It allowed us to get closer to Balinese local community. If you have a chance, I would totally recommend this place!","Staying here for 2yrs.. So comfy, quite, has small park, clean pool, parking lot. Big room &  private kitchen. We are so happy living here, its so memorable. Gonna miss this place so much ü´∂üèª. Thank you Bli Putra..Success always for Umasaih Guest House","I am sad to leave the country but wanted to express our gratitude to you. Thank you very much Agung for the hospitality and honesty, I have been staying for almost a year and I had best experience especially how you handle our needs during our stay. The room is spacious and have own kitchen that's very important for us so we can cook our healthy food every day. The big swimming pool and garden is a big plus for us! I will spread the words to our friend, so happy with this place!","At the first sight the place looks great. Big pool, big garden, big room, your own kitchen. Location is not too far from Canggu, gas station works 24/7 100m away. But be ready for much noises around you: 2 constructions, loud music from the feeld behind a kitchen, neighbours dog which bloody screaming, your neighbours who making BBQ with music until 1am. I couldn't sleep well for 2 months staying there. The owner was very friendly and tried to solve all that, but there is nothing much he can do. I got the most disappointment when I asked them not to through away some of things I left in the room, but they did it anyway. The room was still mine, I moved out 1 day earlier!
I wouldn't recommend that place for long stay."
