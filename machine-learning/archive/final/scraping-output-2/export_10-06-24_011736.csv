They have a dedicated staff to show us to our room.
The fitness centre and spa are excellent. Wonderful and attentive staff to make you feel well taken care of.

One interesting thing that I thought would not happen  to a Kempinski hotel: I wanted to swim at the magnificent pool at around 5pm, only to be told that there were no towels available for the guests and they do not think it will be replenished any time soon.

It is located at a very pretty location where you get unblocked views of the ocean. However, it is rather remote and is not very near to any other amenities / attractions by foot.","Undoubtedly one of the nicest hotels / resorts in Bali. The Javanese temple inspired architecture here is stunning and also offers panoramic views of the beachfront. The rooms are also big and well equipped with comfortable beds and great showers. Service is also excellent throughout the estate, from the reception to the room service and even in the gym.

Food in the hotel‚Äôs restaurants is decent but not as good as what you might get at eateries around Bali whilst carrying upmarket prices. The resort itself is well equipped for a family vacation that would never require you to leave the place but Nusa Dua itself is probably not the best location for younger folks looking for a more exciting vacation.",Check in process was fuss free. Service here is beyond superb üëå; no ridiculous hiccups that I had experienced a year back at an adjacent hotel so - fantastic! Breakfast buffet was delicious. Food however was extremely expensive- US restaurant prices. One lunch was easily $50 after tax. People are pleasant and service staff does take good care of you. The beach is in pristine condition and the pool is to die for- absolutely majestic. I will definitely be back. I felt right at home here.,"Such an amazing stay here! The staff are all so wonderful and looked after us throughout our stay so well! We loved how there was a real emphasis on security when entering the hotel, we always felt safe! The beach club on site was amazing and all the different pools were beautiful spots to relax! Our room was super clean and the cleaners seemed to be able to clean it multiple times a day. We visited this resort during Chinese new year so we also got to experience a lot of the Chinese new year celebrations they had going on plus they delivered Chinese new year themed chocolates to our room which was a nice touch!
I would say this resort is perfect for family‚Äôs but it‚Äôs also great for couples!","Amazing, amazing, amazing. Amazing location with wonderful choices of breakfast. From Asian to western food, all of them were exquisite. There was a pool, a hot tub if I remembered, and it was all right next to a beautiful beach. My mom, my aunt and I woke up early to go to the side of the beach and see the incredible sunrise. Sadly, it was cut off short because it was raining. But my experience here, I will never forget it."

We are planning to return to this hotel. 5 üåü","Overall not a bad hotel. We had a good experience but will I book it again.....NO.......

Location:  right on the beach, direct access, in April for 3 nights, all throughout low tide, u can see algae and rocks all over the beach. Nothing around the hotel ....for convenience sake. All beaches are a short drive of 20-30 mins

Hotel : it has all the facilities of a 5 star. Reception check in/ check out was a breeze. Very good staff. Free drinking water. The tower section is good for closest to the beach and swimming pool. Main building for restaurants and lobby access. Both the tower and main building rooms can have a sea view.

Rooms: we took a family room with a sofa cum bed which was good for 2 kids of 11 yrs. Room size, amenities and decor was all very good.

Food is really good , breakfast spread is vast.","Just returned from a stay at this magnificent resort and I can‚Äôt compliment it enough.

The entire experience from start to end was smooth as. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and we were treated like royalty.

We stayed in the king room pool view and cannot fault a thing. The rooms were massive with a decent sized balcony. Comfortable beds and high quality toiletries.

The resort itself is huge and the views from level 15 are stunning. There are several pools to choose from but we always hung out at the one with the swim up bar.

We also tried all the restaurants - Paon, Shore, Breeze and the food was absolutely delicious at each one. The breakfast spread was faultless too.

I am already thinking of booking our next trip back to this resort.

Thanks Hilton Nusa Dua for a lovely vacation!","Beautiful resort. Impressive grounds. Such excellent service cannot falter their hospitality. The only downside would be that the beach area is not really accessible for sunbathing and swimming- there are too many rocks and not much sand area, so really you are confined to the pool areas for these activities. Views are breathtaking, sunrise is very beautiful.",We enjoyed our stay in the 2 bedroom villa. The service was impeccable and if any issue arose it was quickly resolved. Woke up to a gecko on the ceiling at 2 in the morning and someone promptly came over to help us. Whatever we were in need of it was taken care of. The breakfast has a wide variety of options and the massages at the spa were very relaxing. We would stay again.

I strongly request all booking websites ban this property. If you care for your safety you please stay away from this property.
When we arrive the man said this property no longer have any contact with Agoda anymore. If we want to stay we have to pay again 150,000 / room for 1 night.
I check reviews in Google and found that same review were made from last 6 months but somehow until now this property still listed in many booking websites.

We had a private room with bathroom inside so you can have a shower after the massage (no extra charge). The private room was very clean and great hygiene. Also we got car pick up from our hotel. 10/10 for everything.,"Highly recommend. Probably one of the best massage I‚Äôve had in a while. The price is worth it compared to the massages in the hotels.

Fell asleep a couple of times, it was so relaxing and the pressure was just right. I had the rose hill special message and the facial. Both were excellent.

Do drop by if you‚Äôre looking for a great massage that is worth the price.","Let me start by saying the service here is excellent: from the complimentary chauffeur service for those living in Nusa Dua to the welcome tea and to the coordinated bows when you leave - it‚Äôs indeed top notch. The unfortunate bit is that the core offerings are somewhat lacking. The masseurs here lack technique and the massage you get is more akin to rubbing versus proper kneading or pressure being applied around the muscle fibrers and key spots. You can find better massages around Bali for a similar or even better price so whilst the service is great, it‚Äôs unfortunately not a top recommendation from me","We highly recommend Rosehill Spa. It is clean, friendly and comfortable. They even picked us up at a nearby hotel. We each had a 90 min massage performed by expert massage therapists who did a wonderful job and applied the perfect amount of pressure. We will definitely return in the future!","I am not a normally a person who seeks out a massage, I came for a massage because my wife wanted one and I had nothing else to do. I told them I would only have 60 minutes while my wife had 90 but halfway through I told the masseuse to make it 90 as it was the best massage I had ever had. For me it beats Swedish and Thai hands down. They also have a small Korean restaurant which I‚Äôll review next."

We were part of the Luxury Escapes package and although the menu was cut down, it was still extensive and had something for every palate.

The restaurant offers an authentic Japanese dining experience, It has a modern twist that makes it stand out from other Japanese restaurants I've visited  recently.

The quality of the food was exceptional, with each dish beautifully presented and bursting with flavour.

The design of the restaurant was also remarkable, with a tranquil and elegant setting that provided the perfect backdrop for a memorable dining experience for the both of us.  The service was impeccable, with attentive staff who were knowledgeable about the menu and eager to ensure a pleasant dining experience for all guests.

It was so good, we dined there twice on our recent stay.","Yes to the service! They were very attentive and delivered such warm service. The waitresses really care and well trained. They would inform you if something took longer than usual, the sequence of food to be served, recommendations, and so on. This was the best I had in the past few years living in Bali. Top notch or I got lucky that evening üòé

The food was innovative and creatively presented. The taste was good as well. Their cocktails were worth trying although they used mostly local spirits. That gave different nuances that you might or might not like.

It was conveniently located off the lobby so it was easy to find and you don‚Äôt need to hike or call the buggy to get there. Lovely!","Nestled within the Apurva Kempinski Bali resort, this restaurant boasts a modern take on Japanese cuisine. This restaurant promises a playful spin on classic Japanese dishes, aiming to create a unique dining experience. While the menu delivers on innovation, the execution is somewhat uneven.

Friendly and attentive services!

The menu boasts a selection of creative offerings. While some hit the mark spectacularly, others might not be for every palate.  For example, the the mizu kaisen (aka tuna sashimi on bread) falls a bit flat; the garlic butter overwhelms the delicate flavor of the tuna, creating an unbalanced bite.","I have come few times here. This restaurant is one of my favorite japanese restaurant. The taste is very good but because the portions are so tiny, we usually ordered a lot till full üòÅ there was one time that i ate ramen was tasteless but only that. The rest was amazing. The service was good and they were very helpful and nice. Definitely come there again.","6 out of 5 starts üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü.

The staff of the restaurant are friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Special mention to the staff that served us are Surya, Super and Ayu. Well done! The complimentary anniversary cake and drinks they gave was beautiful. We highly recommended this restaurant for everyone. Thank you Bai Yun.","Was looking for a place to sit back, relax, and enjoy some good food and view. Managed to find Bai Yun for that, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves throughout the afternoon. Every single one of the service crew was especially friendly and helpful, and food quality was high.

Had their all you can eat dim sum buffet, that was available from 12 to 4pm on weekdays. Although people would question why you'd have dim sum here in Bali, what I love about it is that their dim sum tasted like dim sum. Portions are small, but you may want to order one first to see for yourself, before ordering more.

I especially liked their fish congee, their pork fun gao, the lo bak go, Szechuan homade tofu, bak choy garlic sauce, and their chrysanthemum jelly. Wash it all down with some Jasmine tea, and it's definitely a good afternoon.","The all you can eat din sum is THE BEST!!! We had such a great time there.

The hot pot experience was ok. I didn‚Äôt enjoy the individual hot pot - sort of lacking that interaction / intimacy when you share the hot pot with others. Also the food was quite pricey.","very good atmosphere, good quality of food. I love their roasted pork, duck, and chicken feet. The beef balls were also really good and juicy. We told the waiter the veggie was a bit salty and they changed it right away. Waiting time was a bit long at first, waited 15-20 mins for the food to arrive, but all in all a really good dimsum experience. I would recommend.
The chef at the end also visited all the tables to make sure everything was okay.","We had an enjoyable dining experience at Bai Yun, a delightful Chinese/Cantonese restaurant located at the Apurva Kempinski Hotel. It was an overall positive experience as we indulged in their all-you-can-eat dim sum lunch. The dim sum selection was exquisite, especially the har gow, fried shrimp dumplings, and shu mai. We could taste the premium, fresh ingredients and so each bite was a burst of authentic flavors that left us craving for more. Another highlight was their seafood fried noodles, which were a true delight to the taste buds. The perfect blend of textures and aromas made it an unforgettable dish. Both chocolate bun and custard bun are something you wouldn‚Äôt want to miss. What truly sets Bai Yun apart is not just the exceptional food but also the outstanding service. It was heartwarming to see the head chef personally engaging with customers, checking if everything was to their satisfaction. Overall, it's an experience I would highly recommend to anyone seeking an authentic and memorable dining experience."

I wouldn't stay again as it's not value for money. The breakfast was lovely!","This is not a 4 star hotel by any stretch like it's rated on Agoda etc, more like a 3 or 3.5 at best. The photos are deceptive, probably done by a professional.
We had booked 2 rooms, both rooms had really bad sewage smell (room numbers 325 & 327). The bathroom looked run down. I complained about the smell but we didn't get much help, so we cancelled our booking and went to another hotel.
We didn't use any other facilities like the pool, just had lunch at the restaurant and spent couple of hours in the room.
On the plus, the staff did appear to be hard working and keen. The hotel owners need to invest in infrastructure.
If you're looking for budget accommodation with pools, maybe this place is good, but otherwise spend some extra $$ and go to a 5 star hotel."

Cocktails are also served here during late afternoons with a nice selection. Service staff here are exceptional and my only wish was for better quality bites.
Otherwise great place to chillax","A bit of Heaven on earth.  The staff is so attentive, I feel eyes following me .... who is she! Thank you to all for making my trip to Bali a dream that I didn't even wish ... didn't know to wish.  Thank you,  Keren","Oka and Baduk are the very best in the business, even named a drink after us. The ""Ron and Tee""","The Lounge was nice but a bit far away from everything else making it inconvenient for visiting outside of breakfast and cocktails. Probably to force the purchase of water and soft drinks at their other venues.

The cocktails are pretty poor quality at all venues, cheap alcohol and unbalanced flavours and over use of alcohol.

Wine, beer and regular spirit/mixtures were okay. Staff were very friendly and happy please.",Awesome lounge at Hilton bai resort. Very good staff & customer service. Beautiful surroundings for seating outside. Not many varieties in food but it‚Äôs alright with evening alcoholic drinks. Only members can enjoy ether lounge services.

We were staining at the Hilton in Bale and went to Grain restaurant for dinner as they had a Spanish night on for I think it was 650000idr
The food was exceptional
Everything we tasted was scrumptious
Nothing was over cooked like it normally is in Bali
The manager Krishna  went around to everyone and introduced himself to see how we all were
Very professional Krishna
All the staff were amazing and helpful
It was a night I won‚Äôt forget
If your in Bali book a meal at this restaurant
The staff and food are simply the best I‚Äôve had in Bali
Awesome work
5* from us","Our extended family all ate at Grain for a seafood buffet dinner and it was really awful. The seafood was so bad, old, warm, and one of our older relatives vomited after dinner. The best food for dinner was the fries, and the chicken wings, pork belly and dessert (just the strawberry tart and peanut meringue) were the only things we ate. We were very disappointed as it was about $80AUD a head and everybody was able to complain it was the worst and most inedible buffet we've experienced. Our families are visiting from all places overseas, and we were celebrating a birthday, and this was an extremely poor dinner.

The ambience was the only redeemable quality about this restaurant, and we had a performance serenade our relative's birthday with live country singers. The restaurant is also very cute and was quiet when we came at 7pm.

The service was fast and busy as we were a large table, but I had been ignored twice asking for a set of cutlery and was waiting so long I started eating by hand. I would not recommend visiting this restaurant for dinner.","First time to have a breakfast here with family. The environment is great. They offered variety of foods from Indonesia, China, India, and Western. I do love their pastery which is so good. They also have their own barista to make your cappucino. Overal I will go here again to enjoy the breakfast.

Keep it up good services along with good food. Cheers.","The breakfast here is extraordinary, there are so many dishes / options to choose from you would need a whole week to try all of them out. I tried most of them and they're all great (didn't try ALL of them due to dietary preferences)","I'd give the food and the staff 6 stars if I could!

Yum yum yum !

Lucky enough to get a tour of the buffet, took 5 minutes by itself,  around 350 (!) fresh,some local and most on the premises prepared items, and what a sumptuous spread.  I could eat here every day for a week and have a complete different breakfast every day.

From healthy, to hearty and to the indulgent.

Hope the pics do it justice. The dim sum was to die for, the mushrooms and Kung Po chicken too!

Delicious double espresso's. My friend had soup with rice noodles and veggies , all made to order. And I had poached eggs with hollandaise sauce.  And the freshest fruit salad. The international selection rocks.  Home made assorted yoghurts!  Durian Ice cream.

If you really want to indulge and treat yourself, come early and take your time to enjoy this."
