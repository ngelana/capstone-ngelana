Loved it ,. Thank you Warni for the serviceüëçüèº",Good place for Indian food. Everything was delicious. Just make sure you don't add too much food colour. It's not required. Your food tastes good. Very friendly staff.,"This restaurant was a unique find in Nusa Penida. Authentic Indian flavour and very satisfying. Our hosts Sulastri and Bella were amazing and were very helpful.

Must visit.",Good Authentic Indian food.If any instructions given they follow it in a great way.They have plenty options for vegetarians Great choice of Indian songs they play.Overall good experience.,"Amazing experience here at this indian restaurant!

Please take into consideration this location also for food. The pool is amazing and the rooms are very big and clean. I like the fact that the rooms are far from each other which offers you silence and privacy.,"Very welcoming staff, they even brought ice tea to our room after checking in! Very flexible and they also have a gym, restaurant and swimming pool that close by 10pm so plenty of time. It‚Äôs an adventurous path to get to your room also, quite hilly. With the AC rooms, you get the luxury feel as well as reminders from geckos that you are in the jungle! Bathroom was clean, all amenities provided including toothbrush and paste. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. There was also parking and the streets are quiet.","Infinity pool was really nice. Gym was handy, because on whole island there is not so many to pick from.
Room overall was clean, BUT we had to kill like 8-10 cockroaches during our 3 night stay. Also if you wanted to make your shower work, you had to turn sink first.
Service was weird, they left leftovers from others for days around pool for no reason so we had to clean it.
The price is fair and the pool was as I said really good. I would recommend it for students tho.","In short words , its just amazing! Pure nature ambience, quiet beautiful cottages with pool beside. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Its near to  jungle, bird chirping, cool wind. Location is just marvelous . Their restaurant menu has different kind of food with reasonable rate. Had Chicken magaritta pizza and was so good. Complimentary breakfast also available. And the rate is the most attractive part , just 2000 INR ( booked via booking. Com) worth the penny. Highly recommended.","I loved that amazing place so much! They have open swimming pool and in the evening u can enjoy star sky but in the day u can watch amazing jungle viewüòç Dwik from front office is so hospitable worker. She helped me to solve my questions, with my bags carrying with all information about they abilities. And my room was so enjoyable üíî"

The location is perfect, surrounded by peaceful jungle and the grounds of the hotel are filled with beautiful well maintained gardens. It's central location makes it perfect to explore all parts of the island. The room was comfy with high quality sheets. To top it off they made an amazing floating breakfast that I requested for my partners birthday. We felt really at home here and didn't want to leave! Also the stars at night are incredible üòç 100% recommend this amazing place.","We had a great experience at the Bagia Bungalows. Very clean, good food and AMAZING staff. They were extremely friendly and arranged a day trip, which was very well organized by driver Wayan.","Lovely staff! ‚ò∫Ô∏è We loved everything about Bagia Bungalows: The view, the people, the rooms and the food. Food was by far the best food we ever had in Indonesia. We can highly recommend the Mie Goreng and Sate Tempe (with extra rice). The rooms are very beautiful, clean and the beds are very soft and comfortable. Thank you Bagia that we could enjoy such an amazing stay!","The hotel could help to settle for everything, which includes the transport to travel from Port to the Nusa Penida Port, and they have most of the required services. The views are tremendous and the place is quiet and peaceful.

The hotel‚Äôs staff is very friendly and helpful.","Had an amazing experience at Bagia Bungalows.

The property manager and staff was very helpful. They have their own fleet of cabs and they take reasonable prices. They have 2 wheelers available for rent as well.

We were welcomed with fresh watermelon juice and the next day breakfast was decent too.

The room was clean and very decent. Ac worked well and had all the basic amenities like kettle, water, tea/coffee sachets, hair dryer etc.

The overall ambience of the property is really cool. They also have an outdoor pool which is very clean and well maintained."

The room are really nice and the pool is perfect.
We highly recommend this establishment for your stay at Nusa!","We loved this hotel in Nusa Penida, highly recommended!!!

Very good service, they are very nice and very attentive at all times.

We had dinner and breakfast there for 3 days and the food was delicious, they even included a free plate of fruit:)","SOOO WORTH the money!!!
Made a last minute book before we arrived at Penida.
The location was perfect (for us).
Their hospitalities were amazing!!

We only stayed for 1 night, but they served us 3 times welcome drink (when we arrive, when we swimming in the pool after back from the beach, and before we leave the hostel after pick up our luggages).

We had the dinner from the resto and it was big portion for the price!!
And it‚Äôs tasty!!

Would definitely recom this hotel/villa if you are looking one around Penida!!","The great hotel is nestled in beautiful nature, with friendly staff and a great restaurant. However, it's a nature house, so if you're scared of geckos, it might be best to choose another hotel.
While harmless and beneficial for insect control, Balinese geckos have a special high-pitched sound that could disturb you at night. They typically stay on walls and roofs for hunting, but one night we did see one in our bed (it quickly scurried away!) üòÖüòÖ
We requested a room change and didn't encounter any further gecko visitors.
Be aware that the hotel is currently undergoing expansion, which may cause some noise disruption.
Additionally, the sounds of nearby motorcycles and roosters crowing can be intrusive for some guests.","Stayed here with my girlfriend. Was a wonderful place, centrally located. What really was amazing was the staff. They helped us out with everything we needed. We can highly recommended the floating breakfast. Thanks for all the effort guys!"

Price wise not that expensive and not cheap as well, this is tourist area so still reasonable price. Clean and nice place with a good wifi connection. And she gave us free fruits as desserts. Highly recommended place for eat!","Warung NG is a hidden gem nestled up the road, but it quickly became our nightly haunt thanks to its unparalleled hospitality. The hosts greeted us with warmth, treating us like family despite not staying in their accommodation. Every meal felt like a culinary journey, with each dish surpassing the last in flavor and authenticity. We indulged in their diverse menu, savoring every bite. And when we needed transportation, the boss man's trust and friendliness made hiring a scooter a breeze. If only we had chosen to stay in their accommodation! Without hesitation, I urge anyone seeking an unforgettable experience to make Warung NG their top destination","Amazing staff so lovely food really tasty and so fresh , limitless but take time but worth it cause all fresh and lovely place relax for penida island this place can take 5 stars"

Unfortunately the electricity went off in the night for around an hour due to strong winds but that‚Äôs understandable.","I stayed at Merta Sari Resort during my trip. The bungalow is clean, the location is grete and host is welcome and able to help with renting a scooter","This is a very cool place to stay. There is a spacious room, hot water, polite staff. The owner of the bungalow named Pande helped us a lot in organizing a snorkeling tour and we were lucky to see mantas. We contacted him on various issues and he always helped us. If you are looking for a place to have a good rest then this is a very good choice. Also he helped us with ferry tickets and transfers.","I highly recommend this food for those of you who like to enjoy snacks while getting work done. With an affordable price, mertha sari resto is the perfect choice to accompany your family day out.","Stayed here for two nights. Really good location to visit the main tourist attractions. The staff was exceptional, always helpful and always there when you needed them! They even offered me a later checkout because the bungalow was not booked this afternoon. For me and my scooter, it was the perfect location to visit places like Kelingking, Broken Beach, Tembiling Beach, Saren Cliff Point, Crystal Bay. From here, you avoid the daily traffic jam around the harbour. The restaurant was also very good with very good prices, no tax, no service charge like in many touristy restaurants near the harbour. Also plenty of other very good warungs within five minutes on the scooter. Mattress was very comfortable. Water pressure in the bathroom was very good. Would definitely stay here again."

Visited this restaurant as part of our tour with Maha Penida. We ordered a chicken curry each.
Our curry was served full of chicken bones and chicken still attached to the bone. We spent as much time fishing out chicken bones as eating the actual curry. In the end, there was more bone (and some skin) than actual chicken meat!
The toilets were horrendous. Once opened, a smell of stale urine spread through the restaurant. Coincidentally, this was around the same time staff decided to clean them just after we refused to use them.
We looked around and saw other members of our group seemed to enjoy the food as much as we did.
To anyone visiting Nusa Penida, check with your tour operator first (if lunch is included) to make sure you're not taken to dodgy restaurants such as this.",We came to this little place while on our tour in Nusa Pedina. Both dishes were very good authentic food. If you are on the Island and near give it a try.,Had a very good vegetarian lunch.  Delicious.,Miss this place please. Food is really awful here.,Dream
