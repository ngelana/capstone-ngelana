The place is beautiful, the food is delicious, and not only do they provide local and cultural entertainment but they also maintain a strong spiritual presence, which is what visiting Bali is all about. I could only be so lucky to have the opportunity to visit the Bulian Homestay again and I would recommend it for anyone... solo travelers, groups, couples, and families. Suksuma to all of the wonderful people who have a hand in that community.","We went for a cooking class, and that was an incredible and authentic experience! We were showed everything - the garden where the ingredients grow, we got to chop and see how the food is made, my 7 year old daughter participated in every step and was excited. We got to eat the food we all prepared, and that honestly was the best food I've tried during our trip around Bali! Definitely recommend! The setting was also wondering - a local house and sweet family. Definitely one of our highlights in Bali, and something you can experience only in North Bali!","Visited Bulian Homestay with a group tour at the end of Dec 2023. We had a great experience. The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. The meals were prepared with a lot of care and thought for dietary restrictions. There were vegetarian, gluten free and nut free options for all meals. The staff even offered happy hour drink deals which the group took advantage of. Had a wonderful time and recommend others to visit here for sure.","thank you for the service
I am very satisfied with the service, because the staff is very friendly and kind.
the room is very beautiful and clean, I like the view because there are lots of trees planted there so I know all the trees which bear fruit.
The room facilities are very complete
