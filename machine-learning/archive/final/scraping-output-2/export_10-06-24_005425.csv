Came with my 2 teenage girls and a friend and had one of the most hospitable stay in Bali. Staff was extremely attentive and polite, and the host was very charming. Will definitely come back and stay at Villa CASABLANCKA again!","Absolutely Beautiful and peaceful haven! We really enjoyed our stay. The staff are extremely friendly and showered us with attentive and excellent service. The food was super yummy. The rooms were clean, spacious and stylishly decorated. Loads of activities to do within the compound like playing tennis, board games, pétanque, watching movies in the “mini cinema”, have massages and spa treatments..... Would definitely be returning in the next trip!","The function room and screen room with no functioning AC, an horrible service, very bad food, privacy invasive staff, dishonest host. The house manager is a disgrace. We were happy to leave",I was in the same group with Mathieu. Disastrous experience. Too long to describe here. Nice villa and bad stay,
