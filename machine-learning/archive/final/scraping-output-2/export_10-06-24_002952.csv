This hotel offers an outstanding combination of top-notch service, exquisite food, and breathtaking surroundings, which together create an unforgettable stay.

From the moment I arrived, the staff made me feel incredibly welcome and attended to all my needs with a genuine smile. The service was impeccable, with every detail carefully taken care of, making me feel truly pampered.

The staff at the bar/ restaurant Ita, Sinta, Ayu, Astiti and the sweet Traini Vika, is incredible service minded. Always smiling, observant and attending your wishes. Both sweet and professional.

The food at Abian Ayu Villa is a culinary delight. Each meal was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The fresh, locally sourced ingredients and the chef's creativity resulted in dishes that were both delicious and visually appealing. The cocktail with the red pepper garnish was a highlight, perfectly balancing heat and refreshment.

The surroundings of the villa are simply stunning. Nestled amidst lush greenery and overlooking serene rice fields, the view is like something out of a postcard. Whether relaxing by the pool or enjoying a meal with a view, the natural beauty of the area is ever-present and incredibly soothing.

I highly recommend Abian Ayu Villa to anyone looking for a tranquil and luxurious getaway. It's a place where you can truly unwind and enjoy the best of what Bali has to offer.","The 4-star hotel rating does not do this gem justice. Service, food, location, and rooms are all worthy of 5 stars.

Please take care of pool regularly or replace the trees that has lots of worms with tree types  that has fewer worms.","Nice rice terrace field view, good breakfast, but no aircon (very hot) with open air ventilation - lots of insect and mosquito and burning smell from neighbouring rice paddock came to the room (not good if you have respiratory health problem).

The service was amazing as well as the food. Everyone here is so friendly! I highly recommend this spot, especially if you are vegetarian. They have a whole separate menu for vegan/vegetarian with many choices!","Unforgettable Stay at Cepik Villas in Sidemen, Bali

During my extensive travels across Bali, Cepik Villas stood out as the pinnacle of hospitality. Nestled in the serene landscape of Sidemen, this haven was more than just a place to stay; it was a home away from home.

The staff, particularly Wayan and Ela, were the heart of Cepik Villas. Their exceptional service and genuine warmth transformed our experience into something truly special. Every request was met with a smile, and their attention to detail ensured a seamless and comfortable stay.

The villas themselves are a testament to Balinese beauty, blending traditional architecture with modern comforts. Waking up to the tranquil rice fields, accompanied by the gentle sounds of nature, was a daily delight.

I am already planning my return to Cepik Villas. It’s not just a recommendation; it’s a promise to myself to revisit the best hotel experience I’ve had in Bali.","We were pretty disappointed with our one night stay here. The reviews are raving and the photos don’t quite accurately portray the condition of the villa.

When staying in Sidemen, you get that true local feel. Rather than ravishing resorts, you get to live like a local but to me, the stay was not worth what we paid for and we were pretty terrified to sleep there for the night.

The best part of the stay are the workers and the view. The rice patties are absolutely stunning, especially under the soft morning sun. The staff here are friendly and accommodating.

However, there are two basic things you should have in a hotel: cleanliness and sense of security. The room was not clean. The mosquito net was full of stains and holes, which defeat the purpose of the net. The entrance door was incredibly flimsy. Even when locked, if you just shimmy the door a certain way, you can enter the villa without a key. The door lock itself is not secure. The window locks are even more secure than the doors. When we brought up our concerns to the staff, we were told “don’t worry, this is not a dangerous area.” That wasn’t what we wanted to hear considering this was our last night in Bali and everything we owned and purchased on our trip was sitting in our villa. We felt insecure and somewhat paranoid the whole night which did not produce a restful night. In addition, the mattress was very springy and hard so it’s not for side sleepers.

The food quality was also very average. We ordered the fried noodles with chicken, fried rice, and chicken satay. Both the fried noodles and chicken satay were incredibly salty and hard to swallow. The only dish that was bearable was the Indonesian fried rice. The breakfast was brought to our room and it was again, pretty average. The dishes were dirty and the ingredients didn’t taste very fresh.

Water was provided in a dispenser in our room however the dispenser was not clean. There were green specks on the bottle of the dispenser, possibly moss growing.

The doors and windows are not completely seal so air conditioning works extra hard to keep the room cool (not cold). Also pests are able to come into the room due to the cracks and holes. We had 3 lizards come in during our very short stay.

Again, my problem is not the condition of the hotel since it was in the country side but my stay was not clean, comfortable, nor felt safe so we were not satisfied. I do not feel like the value was worth it.","I stayed at Cepik Villa. If I say how good the service and breakfast, you may not believe so
To have a real and true service please go and feel the taste.
When I stayed at any hotel I looked  at the details. Start from day one, I don’t find any lacking in service, presentation and staff’s willingness to help.

So peaceful and tranquil, I was sad to leave. The staff are so welcoming and will do anything to make your stay comfortable.

We hired a scooter which is a must for ease of getting around but you will be navigating steep and winding roads so I’d recommend an experienced and competent driver. We loved exploring the hills and valleys.

Waking up to the sound of nature and fresh air..on our last day we experienced a torrential downpour followed by blue skies and sunshine - nature never fails to amaze and being here was just incredible for the soul.

My wife also really enjoyed the morning yoga classes and the massage she got there. We are really happy we got to stay here with our family!

Despite all this, only 4 stars because some inconvenience during our stay. We had (hot) water, electricity and WiFi outages. We got a free massage as compensation for the water outage, but I would have preferred to pay for it and have water the whole time. :) Also, the pool was a bit murky. Although the breakfast was served from 07:00, we could never order food before about 07:20 and they didn’t have a working baby chair.","Slice of authentic Bali. Like with all rural towns, the people have time to smile and be happy. Same goes with the staff. There’s butterflies, bees buzzing around flowers, to a backdrop of rice terraces and dramatic mountains. The local culture has evolved and blended with this environment over millennia. It is a joy to switch off and surrender to to this, if only for a few days.

Fresh coconut and beer chaser by the pool is also fantastic.","The staff is super friendly and kind here and the welcome is just as cute!
Nevertheless, personally I did not enjoy this hotel as much, since I don’t have a good relationship with mosquitos (the bathrooms were open-air) and you could hear your neighbors showering, talking and going to the toilet … the food, for me, was also not as good, but overall my parents liked it a lot :) Plus point though:
We got a welcoming foot massage when we arrived!","Paradise !

No Air Condition
Breakfast was awful (it really tasted all for chemicals...and well...if the eye eats as well...you won't eat it anyway.
The cockroaches I killed the first day on arrival, still lay there after 3 days when we left (on the bathroom floor)
I first thought it was moskito bites, but now, after a few days I found out and it is obvious, that I got bites from you bed bugs there!
Well ... It seems the employees are much more interested in their mobile phones, than in any service.

All in all.. by far not worth the money, by far not the nicest place, by far not the cleanest accommodation.","Absolutely great experience and the best cooking class I have ever tried. Hundreds of ingredients from the local garden, the flavors were amazing. Thank you for a wonderful experience.","Extremely Disappointing Experience

My recent stay at Uma Agung Villa in Sidemen was an absolute nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my experience to help future travelers. The problems I encountered were numerous and extremely disappointing.

The room I was provided was unbearably hot due to the lack of air conditioning, making sleep impossible even after hours of trying to ventilate the room. The cleanliness of the room was subpar, with a multitude of animals and insects present, making for an uncomfortable stay. The room also seemed to be in a state of disrepair.

The Wi-Fi wasn’t working properly and worked only maybe 10% of the stay.

The reception area was often unattended, leaving guests without the assistance they might need. This lack of staff presence was frustrating.

The quality of the breakfast was below average, which is unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber. A satisfying and nutritious breakfast is a basic expectation, but this was not met.

To make matters worse, the shower in my room emitted an unpleasant odor reminiscent of urine, which was unhygienic and off-putting.

When I brought these concerns to the staff, I received only a simple apology, which did not address the issues effectively. I felt unsupported and ignored.

I hope that future guests will not have to endure the same disappointing experience that I did. Uma Agung Villa needs to address these issues urgently and improve the quality of their accommodations. This was an incredibly disappointing stay, and I would strongly advise against booking a room here until these issues are resolved.","We really liked Sidemen and Uma Agung Villa is a great place to stay there, relaxed and family-friendly. It is located right within rice fields and really good value for money. We especially liked the Spa (great massage!) & our child loved the children's pool and the fish in the aquarium at the reception. Everyone was very friendly in a modest way that was just right for us - it felt very relaxing not being asked where we were going all the time. The bathroom was a bit smelly at times and the breakfast, which is really good, could be a bit bigger, but other than that we had a great time."

Overall, highly recommended. (And we own our own 5-star hotel in Bali, so I feel that we are good judges.)","The views are stunning, best we had in Indonesia. But the staff is not friendly, first we went without reservation and the women in the reception said they were full booked. We went to booking online and they had rooms, so we decided to book.
When we came back she never smile at us or give us a warm welcome. We didn’t had a welcome ritual like we saw with other guests (foot ritual).
We stayed for 4 nights/5days. In general the staff never asked anything or tried to talk, never ask my son name or anything about our trip, where we are from, like other Indonesian people we met. We felt a cold and hostile energy. There was an exception for 2 or 3 people working there that smiled and were friendly, but in general the staff from reception and restaurant do not look happy or try to talk to us.
Breakfast was not good, except for eggs and juices. The bread taste like old and re-toasted. Pancakes have a salty taste.
The rooms need to be more clean, sinks are yellow, there is mold in the room and gecko poop everywhere. We saw a little mouse running at night in the room.
This place have a huge potencial, pools are nice and the gardens are beautiful but there is no soul. This is my honest opinion.","We enjoyed 3 nights at the serene Surya Shanti Villas, staying in the Hanoman villa.  This is a small extremely private cluster of one and 2 story villas featuring elegant simple furnishing and thatched roofs.  There are two pools and a restaurant serving excellent breakfast, lunch and dinner. We checked in at 9pm and the staff graciously kept the resturant open to serve us a wonderful welcoming dinner.

Special place, through and through...I found Peter's (the owner of the retreat) way of meditating incredibly simple and powerful at the same time. They teach it twice a day - morning and late afternoon. I am also very grateful that the staff come to meditate as well. Finally, I see the yogic principles of equanimity in practice!
I enjoyed going for daily dips in the river Unda...It was like a daily cleanse for me; I saw beautiful colorful birds and so many butterflies! It was easy to think I was in paradise...
I found Sidemen to be a perfect combination of weather in November. It was ~33% of rain, ~33% of sun, and ~33% of clouds. Not hot, not cold, not humid. Just perfect.
Accomodation was comfortable and specious. Bali is still recovering from ""Covid no tourism policy"" and at Nirarta they too, were doing some small renovations. The retreat property is HUGE and there is a lot of work that needs to be done on a daily basis. But they were managing to keep things clean, functional, and comfortable for their guests.
I LOVED my food...There are not that many places in Bali that know how to cook oatmeal or even have it on their menu! Nirarta does and it's really good :)
The view from the restaurant is breathtaking...it was healing for my downtown-big-city-heart to see it every day. I felt more spacious every day as I absorbed the beauty of the landscape.
I highly recommend this retreat for a short or long term stay. You will feel the purity and potency of the energy of Nirarta as soon as you enter.
Enjoy!!!","So disappointing ….
Wonderful location but… no AC in the room, and construction noise! Impossible to stay","It was great to get together with Peter at his centre after having initially met him back in January in Montreal for the 'Conversations on the Edge of Silence' seminar which he led. His wife Dayu and him have done a great job with the centre and they are currently working on projects to make it even better. They have a great staff! I mostly dealt with Gusti and Ellie who are sweethearts. My room was spectacular, spacious and the view was breathtaking! If you walk down the hill of the centre, you get to a very nice river. From the centre, you can take nice walks to some beautiful places, namely pretty rice paddies. The amenities and meals are just fabulous. I was also invited to join the staff for two daily meditation sessions. I highly recommend this place, especially if you want to experience Bali off the standard tourist circuit."

We came three times with a one year old baby who was sometimes quite noisy, they always welcomed us with a smile and great respect.
The food is excellent, this is the restaurant we preferred in bali. Thank you very much, we will not fail to recommend this restaurant."

Everything was amazing! The food, atmosphere, people, and view. The even accommodated my dietary needs for the cooking class 😊","The worst Indian food we had during our trip on Bali. It is not authentic Indian. Deep fried samosas, naan which shouldn't be called naan and coriander-water tasty curry.

Staff was okay but kind of unorganized.

Nice view but lots of mosquitoes.","Delicious indian food! Nice restaurant and friendly staff. Recommend!

One note by the side - a thing I noticed recently on Google reviews:

To be honest, I am surprised at how carelessly some people give one-star ratings. Then they start with ""This was my worst experience in Bali..."" Like, really? Because ONE mistake was made when ordering? You don't seem to have any other problems in life... Be a bit kinder, guys. Most people here do their best to provide the best service to tourists. If something goes wrong, you can simply address it in a VERY FRIENDLY way. And that's why you don't have to give a one star review - that's not how reviews work and it gives the wrong impression. For me as a review reader, it's annoying when I see bad reviews and wonder why - when I read them, sometimes I can hardly believe what people are complaining about. Please be a little more careful with this.","Great view, amazing food with lots of variety to choose from . Vegetarian options available .
Super friendly staff & great value for money."

Exceptional service. Head waiter helped us get to Patong Bai and even made us a breakfast box because we had to leave early.","We stayed there as a family to discover the surroundings of Sidemen.  The staff is very nice but not very professional since our room - housekipping - was not made every day.  Unheard of in Bali.  Access to the entrance of the hotel is impossible by car because the access road is very narrow and bumpy.  The young waitresses present are very friendly and dedicated since they even offered to carry our heavy luggage all the way and up the many stairs leading to the villas - which we obviously refused.  The food is very tasty but the portions very small.  Despite its charm in the middle of nature and the views it offers, this hotel really does not deserve its 4 stars.","Fantastic spot! Amazing views over lovely rice terraces. The service and staff are very friendly and accommodating, if a little slow at times, but this is the sort of place to slow down!

Some reviews have commented that the food here is not so good. I disagree. I’ve found the food here amazing! Very good breakfasts and the nasi goreng and sate lillit compete with the best warungs in the area (even on price). Highly recommended.

The only challenge can be getting here. The road is very small and not suitable for cars - you will have to walk the last 50m or so - but the staff can help with luggage and help you find parking too if needed.","It’s true!  A lovely Bunglow with views and a balcony.  The food was good and the staff lovely.  Easy to access by scooter, not easy for a car.  The Agung view is quite obscured but still visible and the valley is beautiful.  A large, comfortable bed and a simple but slightly dingy bathroom, all in all a great place.","A luxurious treat for those who loves nature - we stayed one night and enjoyed to be cocooned by sounds of the jungle while sleeping.

The staff is so kind and attentive, they made us feel very welcome from the beginning. The views toward Mount Agung and rice are wonderful.

We enjoyed it all…the terraces, garden, views and bedroom - loved it!"

We had the vegetable curry which was great, and the tomato-lentil soup which was tasty but the portion was too small to be a main course.

The lava cake and fried bananas were good. So were the special juices.","Very relaxing warung with a separate vegan menu ( gf options by request).

For those strict vegans like me and my partner, worry less as they have learned from their previous experience ( vegetarian dessert served to a vegan ) ; but also try to ask about the specific ingredients of the products as the servers are very knowledgeable with what they’re selling.

Owners themselves are vegan 🌱.

Our server was Wayan who was very generous with his knowledge about Sidemen ( recommended tours, etc. ) .

Will keep coming back to this Warung Cepik in Sidemen.

A cup of the Almond Spice soothed my runny nose (as recommended by Wayan) 💆🏽‍♀️

Thank you so much ! Keep up the great service !

~ Eden & Baron","Love this atmosphere, peaceful and cool
Great place to break and had lunch after exploring the ricefield  walk

We choose from the vegan menu and we enjoy the flavor that they offer. Need to come again to try other dishes

Staff was very welcoming and friendly

Cold beer 😁🙏

Cute little gem","Not a place for vegans at all! They have a vegan menu, but don't follow threw with it. Wanted to serve us vegetable soup with chicken broth. Portions are really small and the waitress was not very nice, even rolled her eyes when we had questions to the food.
If you want to have vegans as your costumers then do it properly!
Prices are way too high, but we have seen the same happening everywhere in Sidemen. Don't understand why this place is so much more expensive than Ubud, Uluwatu, Canguu or Amed…"

Shower is the best I have had in a long time!! Room is modern but Baliesc and seriously comfy beds. Love the pebbles on the shower floor,"The most beautiful stay and the place is hosted by the family.
They are so lovely and provide great service.","Absolutely fantastic! We had the best time in Bali at this family-run homestay. Sidemen is a lovely little village, and the Gong Wi Homestay is especially quiet - situated in between rice fields. The room is spacious and clean. But it is the family taking care of the homestay that makes this place special. They are incredibly friendly, helpful and cater to your every wish - they even gave us sarongs for visiting the temple. The food they serve for breakfast and, if desired, for dinner is nothing short of amazing. They also arrange several different activities for you in Sidemen - from trekking in rice fields to cooking or weaving classes. During our stay we did a coconut oil workshop as well as a trekking tour.
If you are going to Sidemen, Gong Wi Homestay is the place to go, if you want a comfortable and relaxing time far away from the traffic of southern Bali.
We would definitely come back!","I loved my stay at Gong Wi Homestay and would recommend others to come stay here too.

The location is ideal. I did not have my own transport but the homestay arranged my pick up for a very reasonable price, and I was able to walk into Sidemen town from the homestay.

On arrival, I opted for dinner which is a must do! The food was delicious and beautifully presented.

The room was the most beautiful I stayed in when in Bali. Gorgeous, large bed. Beautiful bathroom with shower that is partially open air. A nice terrace overlooking the rice fields, so peaceful!

The family is friendly and will give you space and privacy. They can also help organise loads of local activities and tours.

Would recommend a stop in Sidemen for 2-3 nights, with a stay here!"

We really enjoyed the beautiful view on the rice fields and the music.","A fantastic spot for awesome views of the sideman valley and rice fields. We ordered smoothies and milkshakes as we watched the sun set behind the hills. A relatively new and affordable place flanked by a few posh hotels.

Soak it in. Slow down. Savor the moment.",We came for dinner and was so amazed with the flavour and presentation of the dishes. The arak cocktail was great.

So I can recommend for vegans to come here. The prices are also reasonable.,Food is good but it takes a lot of time. Also I think they miscalculated the bill and they had no change.
