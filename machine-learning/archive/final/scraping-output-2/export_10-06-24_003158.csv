The atmosphere inside the villa is like in a beautiful garden with an oasis in the middle of a soothing forest with the sound of the beautiful pool waterfall.
The villa with Balinese architectural style blends with a modern touch gives you a sense of comfort and safety. They have a nice rooftop area where we can browse the whole 360 degrees sorounding. A nice kitchen and a comfy place to hang out with friends. You definitely have no interest to go out, and just enjoying this 3 bedrooms villa.
The Ubud area often rains during our stay in villa Tirta Manik adding a relaxing and soothing feeling, but we also have the opportunity to take a morning walk around traditional rice fields and villages. The view is soooo magical. So I would say, it is highly recommended to stay here to get a natural atmosphere but stay homey yet comfortable.",A delightful and homy place with the elegant Balinese touch. A sincere thanks to the kind owner who let us stay in this villa. And ..the wine at the top level is tasting like never before. Ha ha...üòÄ,"We spent a couple of nights at Tirta Manik and we had a great time... This place is really a gem in Bali, away from the hustle and bustle of the  touristy parts of the island... the 'out-of-the-city' ambiance can be felt throughout the place and coming from busy Jakarta, it gave us such joy to be able to experience that... Thanks to Anton who lets us enjoy his home...",Amazing place with some of the best views Bali. Would love to stay here year round!,a villa that truly represents Bali ‚ù§Ô∏èüå¥
