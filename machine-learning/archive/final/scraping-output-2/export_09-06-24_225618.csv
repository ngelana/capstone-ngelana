One of the best experiences in Bali Tulamben.
For photographers, there's no need to bring extra power outlets, there are plenty in every room. The outdoor shower has a rear entrance so you don't have to wet the whole room in order to get to the toilet after a day of diving.
Food, service, views, pool, cleanliness, staff are all fantastic.
Oh and don't forget to order the various smoothie bowls.","My group of friends and I totally enjoyed our stay and dives with Utama Villa Tulamben from 12 - 17 March 2024.

The resort is located in a safe and quiet location, within a short 10 minutes walk to shops, cafes and restaurants, and most importantly short travelling distance to all the good dive sites in Tulamben.

The villas are very nicely designed, spacious, very clean, well equipped with all the amenities any traveler would require, and especially so for scuba divers who need to dry and charge dive equipment including wetsuits, cameras, torches etc.

The resort restaurant has a very comprehensive international & local menu serving very tasty foods prepared by the local staff. I especially enjoyed the well-stocked wine chiller. The service staff is excellent too, always so responsive and accommodating.

Most important for me, given the challenging weather and sea conditions during our stay, the dive guides and all the resort staff made our dives so much easier and safer by assisting us with donning of gear and tanks, water entry & exit, and spotting the amazing variety of critters in Tulamben dive sites etc. I cannot compliment them enough for this excellent service and support that made my dives so enjoyable.

Highly recommend Utama Villa Tulamben to all macros-loving scuba divers and holiday-makers.

I will be back.","Scuba diver and Underwater photographers‚Äô paradise! Beautiful resort, all the amenities has been considered. Super friendly and attentive staff. We did a refresher course in the pool on the first day before headed out to the Coral Garden.
All the rooms have back entry to outdoor shower and places to dry your gear.

Parta Wayan was our dive master - he has enabled my husband to love scuba again. Wayan was so attentive and considerate, from making sure our masks are defogged, to making sure I have some nice UW photos! He was able to recommend local eateries which was another highlight for us ü§© Highly recommend him if you are looking for a guide üôèüèª

A special mention to Ayu in restaurant and housekeeping. Ayu co-ordinated our orders from meals, to laundry, to massages. She always has a gentle smile to greet you. She made our stay very homely and at ease ü•π

Thank you Team Utama Villa, we loved every moment of it!","Perfect in every way. Fantastic for divers with a separate wet entry. Heaps of room, plenty of charges. Huge comfy beds and clean and tidy. Food was plentiful and tasty and staff get to know you very quickly. Full service dive operation including gear cleaning. The boys are awesome spotters and know their critters and cameras. Nothing was too much. Such beautiful people with a beautiful place. Would absolutely stay again.","My first time to Bali and Utama Villa made me felt like it is a second home in Bali for me. From airport pick up to the three and half weeks I was there. The service, food and communication had been nothing but sensational. Their kitchen close at 10pm and gave me plenty of choice for food when I felt hungry. Highly recommend weather if you are diving here or just visiting the east side of Bali. Rooms were clean and cosy with all the amenities you need. Breakfast was always fresh made for me before or after my morning diving sessions. Mostl likely will be my go to place to stay when I‚Äôm here next. Can‚Äôt wait!!!"

There were a few things that didn't meet my expectations:
The door on my room didn't work, it was very heavy and would get stuck so it was hard to open the door.
The bathroom had not been cleaned in a very long time, the drain was blocked.
The door did not have a key so I could not lock my room from the outside when leaving. This meant I could not keep my things secure.
There were no bins provided in the room.
There was no water provided on site or in the room.

All this said the people are very nice and the breakfast was good. I also loved the cats.","The best stay, Kadek and crew are very accomodating, friendly and fun. The room was very cosy and top clean. It was a much needed tranquillity, with peace and quiet surroundings and chilled relaxing vibes all around. They're hands on with everything we needed, and the diving was superb. I did my open water course with Wonder Dive on the second day, thebinstructor and everyone helped me feel relaxed and confident in the water. Loving every bit of my stay and diving. Totally recommend to stay, dive and do diving course with Wonder Dive! Love you Kadek and crew!","The Pearl of the Sea. Look no further. I stayed with Wonder Dive for 5 nights. My only regret is not staying longer. We resided on their site which contained two modern well appointed villas, centrally located, to a great variety of restaurants all within walking distance. From the minute we arrived we were welcomed by Kadek, who made both myself and my partner feel immediately at home, and part of an extended family. My partner completed her open water course, while I had the luxury of diving everyday, with my own professional guide catering for all my needs.  His exceptional eye for pointing out some of the finest macro I‚Äôve ever seen. Not only did they cater for NX, they went up and beyond in making sure I was able to experience the best diversity one could offer during my stay. Please look no further, support this local family run business where all needs will be catered for beyond your expectations.",I stayed at wonder dive for almost one month and everything was good.  It's very quiet living here and the room is cleaned every day.  And there are three very cute kittens. They are very clingy. I love them so much and will miss them really.,"Didn‚Äôt stay but can highly recommended for diving. I can see why. Such a fun, relaxed but equally safe team. Superb diving, great visibility and so much to see. You haven‚Äôt experienced the team Bali until you come here‚Ä¶thank you üôè‚ù§Ô∏è"

Well designed space, by divers for divers. Brand new amenities, decorated with taste. Bedding is comfortable, room was wide and clean. Loved the pool, big and clean. Food was good, staff super friendly. Very arranging for our late checkout. Nice view on Mount Agung. We hope to be back soon.","We missed this place within a day of leaving it! The neighbourhood is peaceful and charming. The staff are warm, smiley and helpful, the guests are friendly and pleasant. The owner of the villa is exceptionally helpful and cheery, and went the extra mile to make us feel at home. The villa itself was nothing short of a mini paradise! The in-house restaurant makes delicious and affordable food, and there is a great view of the surrounding wilderness and mountains. Even in the room the thoughtfulness of the Utama Villa team can be felt‚Äîabundant universal power sockets, a backdoor for divers who need to clean themselves before entering the house, a large table and multiple lamps for working, a drinkable water dispenser that dispenses hot and cold water. I can safely say Utama Villa has topped any other stay I've done and I hope to be back sometime in the future!","Amazing stay ‚Äì incredible place! Fantastic food, epic sunset views of Mt Agung, big spacious rooms with so many lovely little touches: universal plug adapters, lighting options, and big desks for working with camera gear & photo editing. Aside from the famous Tulamben diving, there's also an excellent snorkel from straight down the road ‚Äì swim up to the Liberty Wreck, above the Coral Gardens, to see innumerable fishes, sea turtles and rays. We absolutely loved it and have already booked to return (for longer) later this year.","A nice place to stay while scuba diving in Tulamben.

Rooms are very spacious and well furnished catering to all needs of an underwater photographer. Good table to set-up camera, with international plug points and extension cables, additional lighting for camera set-up area.

However, air-cond is not cold enough, probably the room is too big? ü§î

Bathroom is very spacious.

Good choices of meals to order from, just that when serving local items like Nasi Goreng or Mee Goreng, no 'keropok' is included and also no 'sambal'! Need to order additionally/separately the sambal, that's quite a shame as the sambal ordered is good portion that will be 'wasted', since it is not reasonable to have them all in a sitting!

I dive with Ari Stenberg, very helpful and sharp eye finding the small and tiny Critters. I gather in general, most of the Guides/Spotters are very good as most of the other divers I met during my 7D/6N stay are very happy with their dives.","New Resort,cozy place and reasonable price.
Friendly staff good food,and you will enjoy the sunset from rooftops."
