They always had a smile on their faces and were very welcoming. They made sure to address all of our requests promptly and efficiently. Additionally, they were very attentive and made sure we were happy and satisfied throughout our stay. If there was something bothering us, they went out of their way to help.

The massage treatments at Sukhavati were a great experience. They offered a variety of different types of massages and treatments. Each session felt like it was tailored specifically for me, even though I had a massage every day. The quality of the massages was consistently excellent, and I always left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated.

Lastly, the cooking and food at the resort were absolutely delicious. The meals were prepared with fresh ingredients and had a wonderful taste. I thoroughly enjoyed every meal during my stay.

Overall, my experience at Sukhavati was fantastic. The friendly and accommodating staff, the top-notch massage treatments, and the delicious food all contributed to a memorable and enjoyable stay. I highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for a relaxing and fulfilling getaway.","A life changing experience!
Excellent and great quality from A to Z.
The people who works at Sukhavati are gems! From the pick up, to the office staff, the fantastic knowledgable, present and positive doctor, the house keeping, the kitchen staff, the spa staff, the yoga teachers, the gardeners and morning walkers. - All of them made a difference in life and always smiling and being happy. - and it was real!
If you need a time out, own time, being taken care of, inspiration, guiding, good and healthy food and drinks, detox, a re-start.... This is the place to be!
Everyone is being treated and seen as an individual. A tru wonderful experience for body and soul!
And not to mention the beauty of the place..... Just amazing with quality in every corner!
Quality in everything is the key here!.","We did the one day Ayurvedic experience at Sukhavati and it was the most incredible day! This was our first Ayurvedic experience though I have been interested in learning more about Ayurveda for some time and was familiar with it through my yoga practice. I came across Sukhavati and thought the one day experience would be perfect to try during our honeymoon in Bali. It was everything I wanted and more. The grounds are stunning, the staff is so lovely, the treatments were top notch, and it couldn‚Äôt be more relaxing.

We drove a short drive from Canggu (arranged through Sukhavati) and started our day with a fresh coconut juice and consultation with the doctor. They provided us a villa to use for the day which was lovely. Our first treatment was a facial in the villa which was absolutely amazing - so relaxing! We then had a wonderful vegan lunch in the main eating area and enjoyed speaking with a few other people who were doing longer stays. After lunch we relaxed and then did two additional spa treatments - Abhyanga massage and Shirodhara. Wow. Everything about it was incredible. I look forward to one day going back!","Visited Sukhawati and had an amazing week long experience. The vegetarian Ayurvedic food was absolutely amazing, the yoga classes were great, and the center is located in a beautiful part of Bali. Stunning to walk around especially in the mornings. Highly recommend",Had a wonderful time here!! The staff was amazing and the treatments very healing. The kitchen staff goes above and beyond - they are the sweetest and I really enjoyed their food. Same with the massage therapists- the most kind and professional folks.
