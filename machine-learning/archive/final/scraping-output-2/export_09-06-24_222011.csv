The journey there was incredibly beautiful, and upon arriving in Dune Alaya,which was tucked away from the main road, offering peaceful and pleasant nature to soak in from the moment we entered. All the houses are recycled old wooden houses from Java, giving it an old-world charm. We had all the modern amenities, and the hosts and staff were super friendly. There was also a nice swimming pool, making it feel like living a dream life. The food was incredibly well done with attention to detail, offering both Bali and international cuisines. One of the beautiful things is that you don’t have to have any plans to relax because the moment you enter that place, tranquility becomes a part of you. I suggest that everybody should visit and spend a few days, few nights, or even a few months there. All the best.","This place is simply fantastic. From the very first minute I felt more welcome than at any other place on my trip. The whole place is very lovingly and attentively designed. The bugalows are a dream with lots of lovely little details and you are surrounded by beautiful mountains. The team is simply incredible, super friendly and courteous and you are served a delicious breakfast every morning. I can only recommend this place to everyone, whether traveling alone, as a family or as a couple, everyone will find their place here :)","I just returned from Bali, and my experience at this place was absolutely amazing. I went to this place with my family and the atmosphere is really refreshing and it really feels like i'm living in the rural areas of Bali, the place is so clean, the owner and everyone living there are so friendly. My only regret is that i couldn't extend my stay and spend more time with the people because my family and i wanted to explore Bali. But nevertheless, my experience here is really great and unforgetable and next time whenever my family and i have some free time and take a vacation again to Bali, we will book here again","Amazing place !
