In some ways this terminal resembles an airport with announcements for boat departures and a couple of gates where passengers go through to head down to their boats. The boats are also docked on a proper pier","Huge space, clean and beautiful harbor, but unfortunately the toilet didn‚Äôt function well. There are a lot of coffee shops and restaurants so you can have breakfast here. You can go to Nusa Penida island by boat from here, it takes around 40 minutes.","Very busy, allot of traffic to drive or ride down, plan accordingly.
Get to gate and wait 30 to 45 mins for the boat, come in early. Try buying online or else you will have to talk to someone and my rip you in the process.
Inside the waiting area very clean, spacious & cool. long walks.","Pretty good harbour infrastructure, just please add waiting seats at the front. It'll be very helpful because passengers are standing randomly at the front, flocking with travel groups and the boatline. And build a toilet accessible for people who are not boarding or arriving.
Please also put information board of which boat is departing to where on what time at the front, so it will be helpful.

On the rock by the sea, the ledge, proper seating areas (plenty).

It's located next to Pelabuhan Sanur which also means it can get uncomfortably crowded. I usually avoid it during weekends because those were the day when teenagers like to hang out and some shops cater to them by playing loud music. It would be difficult to get parking as well because it's full, unless you come early in the morning. I mean early! Before 6.30 or earlier!

Good:
- magnificent sunrise, therefore its name
- they have tidied up the motorcycle parking area, now it's more spacious and clean
- plenty of seat and place for you to watch the sunrise while contemplating life
- food: a lot of local food with very good local price
- pet friend;y
- plenty of parking (watch out for timing)

Not so good:
- sometimes there are many teenager that prompt the shop to play noisy music
- parking can be tedious if you come here other than early in the morning. Was stuck in parking lot for more than one hour before, unable to get out. It should be better now since they opened alternate parking space. Haven't tried, wouldn't want to try it myself.
- You can park at Bangsal beach and walk here, it's very near and there are usually some parking space there even though you arrive later.

They raise the parking price now. It used to be 5k and 2k for car and motorcycle for the first 3 hours, now they charge hourly at 2k/hour for car. It's still okay, and understandable, however they put the price change only when you are on the exit gate (not entry). Motorcycle can access from Bangsal beach through gang pacar.",Sunrise Beach at sunrise. Was peaceful walking along here and watching the day begin. Gets busy after 6.30AM with all the early birds here to enjoy the view and the freshness of the morning,"Having a good track for jogging and enjoying the view from wonderful Sanur Beach.

A lot of people visit this place in the weekend and I'm surprised at first time come here I see the full of motorbike in the parking area. But actually this place is really something. U can jogging, walking, bycling, yoga, etc.

Of course there are many food stand, so u can buy some food and drink.

This is an incredible and enjoyable place",Not quite lucky this time.. the cloud is in the horizon. But the place is nice. Parking is abundant in the morning. Since its a ferry port to nusa penida it will get very crowded in the afternoon and high seasson. Come early and go home early to catch the sun,"Even though this place called Sunrise Beach, spending time here at noon still recommended to have a quality time, or enjoying the sound-wave, or walking, cycling or people watching, or all at once.
Easy to access, many food stall and coffeeshop. I haven‚Äôt try all coffee here, so couldn‚Äôt really recommend one for you. Anyway, you still can get lumpia here (actually everywhere), please follow your gut feeling to choose for your tummy and yummy.
Not crowded preferably? Come here during weekday. Yap, so hot ü•µü•µ‚òÑÔ∏è‚òÑÔ∏è don‚Äôt forget put the sunacreen, shade and cover or cap.

Was a 40-minute drive to the hotel. Check-in was seamless as we pre-booked on Agoda. They confirmed our booking and assigned us room 104 located on the main floor. The room had one double bed and one single bed, a small fridge, a tv, a table, etc. It was equipped with AC but no fan. The room had bottled water and toiletries. The room wasn't big but did the job. The only thing we did not anticipate was that the washroom had see-through glass and not wall. The staff were super friendly, and they cleaned/restocked the room regularly. The swimming pool was maintained daily. A few downsides we experienced include a leak in the washroom, no dedicated space to dry our clothes, and their restaurant only offered breakfast till 10 am and only tea/coffee afterward. They did, however, have cup noodles and other beverages available for purchase. We were able to get a hairdryer and electric kettle from the reception. The hotel is adjacent to a very busy highway, which was good for us as we rented a car to drive ourselves and included ample parking. Additionally, the hotel was super close to many restaurants, warung, gas stations, and convenient stores. It was walking distance from Sanur Harbor, which was super convenient for us. One thing we loved was that the whole hotel was filled with plants. We also met a friendly cat, we named him/her meow. Please feed him if possible. Overall, we had a pleasant stay and definitely recommend them.","You get what u pay for -  It is a budget hotel.
We are simply staying for 1 night because it is close to the harbor. Maybe more suitable for students & back packers ect.

‚Ä¢ Rooms are tiny with strange colour scheme & weird dirty brown wooly blanket.
‚Ä¢ Cramped for 2 people & suitcases.
‚Ä¢ Dirty scummy,  gross bathroom. Needs a decent scrub down for sure with some proper chemicals. Some weird contraption on the shower head as well.
‚Ä¢ Spiderwebs in the rooms.

‚Ä¢ WiFi works
‚Ä¢ Lots of restaurants walking distance.

‚Ä¢ Service was average.","Worst hotel iv ever stayed in bali. Booked and paid for ‚Äòdeluxe‚Äô room. Got our room that is a triple standard went to reception to advise and she said ‚Äòyeah we have no deluxe rooms available‚Äô so i paid for a product i have not got. Rooms are really dirty and smell musty/damp. Very small rooms look nothing like the photos! Hotel is located right on a busy road, balcony is a shared balcony so no privacy. Tv does not work at all, pillows and bedding smells musty and dirty (slept in my clothes) AC poor also cleaners knocked us up at 9am after already having a rubbish sleep due to being to hot. Bathroom/toilet area smells awful of pee and needs some bleach to clean inside the toilet and change the mouldy shower curtain. Stayed in much nicer hotels for much cheaper than here",It's the worst place ever! I woke up in the morning to find a staff peeping into the my room through the window! I called him out immediately and went and complained to the front office about it. They did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT IT. They asked me which room and were super casual about it like they hardly even cared. I went back to the room to find him cleaning the room next to mine like NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. It was super scary and traumatic and to see they hardly even cared. I checked out soon and left the place to NEVER EVER go back there. Stay safe and don't go there ever!,"Power was out for hours today, everyone complains but the staff just relax on their phone. The pool is disgusting, and rooms are very dirty.

This place has fried fish roe unlike the other branches, i love the texture.

The place is non air con, but still ok.","They offer a very similar fish combo meal like that in Mak Beng, but they also serve other local dishes. Came here since our driver recommended this. I personally prefer Mak Beng'a version more. Found the chilli here is on the sweeter side instead of savoury. Found the fried fish is a tad dry- probably because of the type of the fish. Soup is delicious though, and it came with generous amount of fish too. If you don't wanna queue at Mak Beng, this is a great alternative!","140k for Fish soup with Rice (not the set), Mee Goreng (fried noodles), a vanilla milkshake and a strawberry smoothie. I think it's worth it! Nice breakfast while waiting for our ferry.

Note that the fish in the fish soup is really bony tho.. I got lazy to eat it. I would try the fish head instead if I end up here again. The soup is spicy, salty","Be Sanur fish soup is an old school culinary dish. The menu at the Be Sanur stall is fried fish and chili sauce, plus white rice. A soup with ‚ÄúBase Genep‚Äù spices typical of Bali, the delicacy seems to stick to the tongue. The texture of the meat is dense and not easily crushed. Even though it is made from fish, it does not have the slightest fishy taste. Savory, spicy, sweet and a little sour in one. The sambal served is dark in color because of the shrimp paste mixture. Fried fish that has been smeared with chili sauce, then slurps fish head soup, Love it"

we had Awake Berry Iced Coffee and Almond Croissant.
Berry Iced Coffee was a winner, totally surprised me!
When I started ordering, I was curious about how to mix jam with milk coffee. It felt weird‚Ä¶..
Whe I get my coffee‚Ä¶.omg‚Ä¶..Trust me ! Must try!!
and Almond Croissant service are warm, fluffy and crispyÔºÅThey are all so good!!

Will definitely return for the signature coffee!! update‚Ä¶come here todayÔºÅ
really like their coffeeÔºÅÔºÅ‚ù§Ô∏è","Really busy before the first ship (around 7:30-8:00am). Their coffee is nothing really special but it‚Äôs good that they have plantmilk option - oatmilk!!üòá(5.000rp extra)
I tried a mocha and it wasn‚Äôt tasting like a real mocha at all just a simple cappucino with oat milk. All the pastries look good but tastes really buttery and dry, but at least they warm it up before serving!
We tried a sourdough mushroom sandwich as well, the sourdough bread was good!
It was good for one breakfastüòä
The staff at the bar was very nice!","A great little place to have a coffee and a snack while you are waiting for your boat!
They have great coffee drinks and smoothies, as well as other drinks.
Sandwiches and pastries are available and are very good and reasonably priced.
They have vegetarian options, and they can make your coffee drinks with oat or almond milk, too.
They take cash only, so be prepared","Great coffee, music and energy from the staff. We were waiting for the ferry there and was a pleasure.","The amenities don't match the price of the menu.
Heavily overpriced menu items and they don't accept card, don't have fans or AC and just straight up ghetto design.

Would prefer to enjoy my coffee without second hand smoke clouds."

Saw good reviews on Google about their seafood items. We wanted to get a medium or large fish grill, but they only had jumbo fish. The price on the menu was 175k, but they said it's 190k. We also ordered a few other items, including their famous clams for 55k per kg. In my opinion, the food was too expensive but the taste wasn't exceptional but decent. They were selling tea, samosa, and spring rolls for 30k each. The grill fish came out quite burnt. The skin was too thick to eat. Taste was ok. Clams were nice, but the sauce they used was overpowering. Overall, it was ok but not worth the hype, especially considering the price. I do understand that the restaurant is located close to a touristy area but still felt like we were overcharged massively.",Hidden gem in Sanur! The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but I had one of the best grilled clams and squid here during my entire Bali trip. The sauce on the kerang is to die for and the cumi had an amazing char-grill taste. I would definitely recommend folks to give it a try!,"The best shrimp I have ever had! I had to order a second plate it was so good.  I grew up on the beach and am very familiar with high-quality seafood, and that's exactly what this is. Do not miss this unassuming restaurant, It will blow you away.",The fish is so good! Fried rice is also delicious!,"Best taste of seafood. I love the grilled clams, plecing and sambal matah. The fish is fresh from the fisherman in Sanur. The price is cheap because all including rice & plecing .The owner is friendly. Very recomended for the seafood lover."

I really enjoyed the sea breeze with croissant and hot latte. The croissant was nice but the latte is okay, maybe because I prefer a stronger coffee.

Excellent coffee of all sorts, cold drinks and cakes at ok prices.
