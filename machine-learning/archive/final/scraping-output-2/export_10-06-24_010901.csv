Or","We had a wonderful experience staying at Granyam cottage. Beautiful villa in the nature, delicious breakfast and our lovely host Gustu was a perfect combination for best experience. Nice pool and lovely staff. We requested Gustu for local chicken to have local taste, he bought us chicken and his dad made it ready to cook. We cooked and ate together. It was like staying at friend’s home. Had a lots of laugh and fun experience. I would love to come to Nusa penida and stay at granyam cottage again. Cheers to our best host Gastu.","Best stay i had in my time here in Bali. The location is great when you rent a scooter, because it is right in the center of all the sights. And the best restaurants are 15 min bike ride away. The owner is really helpfull.",,
