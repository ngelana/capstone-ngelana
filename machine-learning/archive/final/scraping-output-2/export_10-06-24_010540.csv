Mold everywhere, dirty sheets, pillows, towels, walls. I couldn‚Äôt seat on the toilet and I didn‚Äôt shower because it was too disgusting. Please just don‚Äôt do it to yourself. Not worthed.","A prison is cleaner!  Stained sheets, dirty pillowcases, dirty shower towel with some bugs on it.  The condition of the bathroom was pitiful.  In the sink there was still someone else's trimmed beard left there without being cleaned up and there was no toilet paper either.  The floor of the room was full of someone else's hair and completely dusty.  Never seen a worse place than this absolutely ill-advised, nightmarish.","Normally I can put up with bad hotels, but the old man that seems to run this place is so rude. Speaks no English and refused to help me when I asked to move room, as my room didn‚Äôt have any WiFi. I tried to use google translate but he refused to look at it and walked off instead.

On another note, the room is dirty, sheets aren‚Äôt clean, when I asked for 2 towels they gave me 1 and said they couldn‚Äôt give me 2, the bathroom is horrific, looks like it hasn‚Äôt been cleaned in year( No toilet roll aswel).

I‚Äôve stayed in plenty other places for the same price (¬£6 a night) and they‚Äôve been a hell of a lot better","Very friendly service, location very close to public facilities, but the rooms are damp and moldy","Good place to stay, parking are is big. Staffs are very good in front. Room is ok to be stay, except bathrooms little bit old. But still ok.
Only thing is wifi is not working properly
Other than that everything is ok, can be recommended"

The bakery was very patient and kind while communicating with me for my many different requests for the cake. The pricing is very reasonable for the quality of the vegan cake. The cake was so creamy, moist and delicious we were shocked it is vegan. i definitely would recommend anyone to come over to get any delicious beautiful pastries or cakes from Rumpis. I have tried many vegan pastries around Bali and i can safely say this is best tasting and looking vegan cake. They accommodate to many diets and offer vegan, gluten free or even refined sugar free cakes.

Thank you so much to the staff for helping make a beautiful cake and for being very nice and kind üòçüòç. I will definitely be back again to get more cakes!!!","I ordered gluten-free cupcakes for my daughter's 22nd birthday. All contact was via WhatsApp and so very helpful about all the options. I could not find what I wanted on the Instagram page for the cupcakes, so I sent what I wanted in terms of style and which colours and type of frosting. The cupcakes were a MASSIVE HIT. They exceeded our expectations and the birthday girl was very happy. We will be ordering again!!! The entire process from enquiry to ordering to delivery was very smooth.","I recently organised, ordered and paid for a cake for my friends fortieth birthday with Runpis from Australia to be delivered to the restaurant we would be having dinner at for her birthday.
I cannot tell you how delightful, helpful and amazing the bakery was. They communicated with me the whole time, they were able to make a gluten free, dairy free and refined sugar free cake that not only accounted for all allergies but that tasted so incredibly good the birthday girl ate the whole cake in one day!
I cannot recommend them highly enough.","Been renovated and it‚Äôs really nice. Recommended to try their Chicken Steak, nice seasoning and good mashed potato.

Ayam Saos Manis also good, a comfort food for elderly. Just a little weird why they give kerupuk as side dish.

Tried their cake probably years ago, so I don‚Äôt know how it taste now.

Good place for chill with friends or family. Reasonable pricings as well.","Place is nice and also cozy. Food taste is good, they have main course and dessert. You can seat on indoor or outdoor area. Garden is beautiful and greeny best for take picture. Recommendation for co-working space cuz they have power plug near the seat and wifi so good"

The flavors lean more towards the Balinese Bumbu Basa Genep spice rather than the traditional Minang Sumatran blend.

Nonetheless, it still tastes good as Nasi Campur, although don't expect the super flavorful blend characteristic of authentic Nasi Padang. On the bright side, the prices are affordable.",Oh the food here is just amazing. This is my favorite nasi padang ever! The ayam balado + tahu & tempe gulai is just the best combination you can ever get ü§§,"Definitely not your traditional Padang food, but the different style is worth to try, and also the ambiance is good","The place is very strategic. It's clean and well-organized. Their service was fast. I really like the taste of the rendang sapi. The meat wasn't stiff, so it's easy to bite and chew. So far, this is the best nasi padang that I've ever tried. The rice portion is normally bigger than what I show in the picture as I requested for half portion of it.","Many choices, can choose Jinggo or Nasi Padang, the difference is in the rice.
But because the order is so many, I need to wait almost one hour to get my order.
But the food is very good."

Ordered chef‚Äôs specialty, but the staff that served me said it was new dish on the menu. So I ask for recommended menu and offered another dish, which ended up very so so in taste quality. Which has me wondering, why recommend me another dish instead of chef‚Äôs specialty that I ordered first, which usually supposed to be recommended dish on the menu, if the dish she recommend ended up with such quality of taste? Which is very stupid to be honest. If the recommendation dish from the staff is such low quality in taste, how is the quality of another dish that is not the best seller ones? As you can see I didn‚Äôt finish it, since it was really THAT BAD.
Complained about this, and was given a scoff as response. Such a quality of service!
Fortunately the cake was good, and ambiance was ok. So 2 star out of 5, makes it not a total fail. Although with that quality of service, make me don‚Äôt want to ever go back anymore.","The the portions are large and very, very tasty. As well as western classics they also have selection of traditional Indonesian dishes that are excellent. The food is actually great value for money even if it is slightly more expensive than elsewhere. They also have a nice selection of cakes, sweet and plain bread, if you just fancy having a coffee and snack.","They start to open from 8 am with some cakes and pastry available with limited number. If you wish to order special cakes, I may recommend to book in advance. The second floor is mostly closed during breakfast time. I can say this shop has the best cake in town","Beautiful place with delicious food. Big choice of cakes, as well as savery dishes. I would say the price is a bit higher than average, but the service and food are great.","Lovely selection but the interior smells like the AC is not clean or too old, like when it has mold or the place might have humidity problems"

Their menu start from 9K!
They are definitely will sold you with their fried mushroom with their endless toppings and their options for more ""heavy"" lunch set, such as pasta, rice, chicken wings, french fries and hottang!
The taste is definitely will be kids-friendly too and it's customizable!
You can also taste their drinks that are quite good but a bit too sweet for me, and it's all non alcohol! So enjoy your refreshing lunch without thinking about your wallet will be robbed!

5/5 will come back again!","place :  easy to find, quite clean, a bit hot but they have fans...
food : spaghetti came out cold, too much sauce, chicken wings also came out cold, taste is okay, hot dog is nice, i ordered the bon cabe, nice, but again too much sauce and mayo..the twister potato took long to serve, but taste is good, crispy is nice, but again, too much sauces...just put the sauces a side, let customer put those sauces themselves...
drinks: nice..we like both our tea (we like not so sweet) and our strawberry bubble
service : is okay, people queue, gojek grab queue, just serve the food as soon as they ready..dont wait , it get cold..and your foods are not the one served cold...

price : okay..reasonable..we might be going bcak...just remember to put the sauces a side...please","As a spagethi lover, I do not recommend this menu here. Spagheti came out cold and overcooked. I should've read the review indeed before buying this. I enjoyed hotang more (potato mozarella). Staff mediocre. Place has couple of flies near kitchen seats. For 36K I got small portion of spagethi, milo drink (Good Day Freeze tastes better than this?) and hotang.","Baliku jamur is our favourite snacks, all the food are fresh and tasted good .
