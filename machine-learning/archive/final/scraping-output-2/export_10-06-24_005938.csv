It is definitely a lifetime experience for me personally! Right from the rooms to the services were at its best!
We were served with a welcome drink when we entered the villa! And we were just amused by the way the villa was built! The entire place was very very clean and hygienic!
There are 2 bedrooms in the villa! The bubble house can be preferably used at night since it gives the best view! The other room can be used in the day time! The bubble house becomes very hot in the morning! Overall it was such a beautiful place to stay with!
Definitely the best for couples for honeymoon!","Much more beautiful in real life üòç! Villa well maintained but it is necessary to pay more attention to the cleanliness, the curtains were dirty, impossible to touch the fridge ü§¢, and at the level of the baseboards there was a lot of dust and droppings of geckos","This is an amazing experience, quite different. You will be in an excluded bubble that has slight AC and air flow.

You won‚Äôt check in until after 5/6PM so that you aren‚Äôt stuck in the bubble while it is hot.

Other than that get ready for a peaceful, different, romantic spot. You will hear the sound of the flowing river while you sleep. You will see the clear night sky while you lay on your back and look up. There is hot water, scenic seating, swings and the locals are really nice.

I crashed my DRONE in the tree lines and grabbed the locals and they helped me cross the river and get my drone out of the trees.","The people that work there are amazing!  super fun and helpful.

The Bubble is good, and there's lots of interesting swings around to relax and enjoy the view to the jungle.

The Negative aspect for me was the Civet's cages. This cute small, fluffy animals were always in my mind, and made me sad...  They are there for guests entertainment, but I don't think most of the tourists enjoy to see that, is very obvious this animals aren't happy and beg for freedom getting crazy on the small cages...

This place would be wonderful for me, if not that detail.","Had an amazing experience here. You get to skip the crowds of touristy places for photos with swings and bird nests, for free. The service staff was very attentive. We requested for BBQ at night and it came free of charge. The staff even brought us to the supermarket to get our BBQ supplies. Note that it can get pretty hot in the day time. That could be the reason of the later time check-in compared to other places."
