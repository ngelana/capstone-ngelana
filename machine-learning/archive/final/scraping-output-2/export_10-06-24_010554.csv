So tasty  crisp fried duck and chicken.  Meat so moist and tender fall off the bone easy. Love the fresh basil leafs and cucumber for the side dish. Importantly for the sambal  is so delicious, still the same since 1st visit 7 years ago.

üíØ recommended for fried duck lovers!! We will be Back again for sure.","At Bebek Patmoroso, the fried duck steals the show with its irresistibly delicious flavor. But the delight doesn't stop there ‚Äì their kol goreng (fried cabbage) and terong (eggplant) dishes are equally mouthwatering.

What's more, the affordability of their menu adds to the overall satisfaction of the dining experience. If you're on the hunt for scrumptious fried duck paired with flavorful sides at a wallet-friendly price, Bebek Patmoroso is a must-visit spot.","The best place for fried Bebek and Chicken, good for brunch and lunch. A must try since its a simple small shop that only served hot food, made upon order. Their sambal is super spicy just like any other good indonesian sambal. Love their duck oil in the bottle, makes the whole food experience elevated to another level. Order everything cause its cheap and good. The shop are hot but they have fan to keep you cool. Must go in Bali!","They said this is the most delicious fried duck in Bali, and yes, I couldn't agree more! My last day was in Bali. I had this fried duck for lunch, and the taste is so amazing! Fried duck, rice with iced tea under 50k rupiah, which is good for price, the sambal is very spicy, and the fried duck is tasty!","The best oily duck ever happen ever haha, i can clean up the first batch of rice by just adding the duck oil to the rice, simply the best. The ducks were the best, clean and tasty the meat is tender. Damn hahah, parking area were big, dinning area can fit up to around 30 peoples i think."

The place feels very welcoming, with a great staff and warm welcome from the japanese owner.

They have large selective of foods and we choose some of it. The food was very delicious..   it was well made, tasty and delicious.. the price is not too expensive and they provide visual experience on their food.. i love it!

I will definitely come again and try more of their food.",Everything I ordered was so good. This is one of few Japanese restaurant in Bali that I would recommend. Japanese couple (I think they are the owner)  was very friendly. Salmon sashimi was very fresh and beautifully presented. The atmosphere feel so casual and humble but a little too dim for me.,This is one of my new favorite Japanese restaurants in Bali. The don is so good! About 90k for a delicious salmon don with generous slices of the fatty fish. It was incredible. It comes with a side of miso soup and a glass of ocha. The unagi roll was also a huge winner. I will definitely come back to try more.,"Okamura Bali is the perfect choice if you're looking to experience authentic Japanese cuisine. The ambiance is distinctly Japanese, and the staff are incredibly friendly and efficient. Even the owner of the restaurant ensures that all of our orders are fulfilled. The salmon sashimi is exceptionally fresh and juicy, while the agedashi tofu is delicious, light, and comforting. Okamura Bali is truly a highly recommended Japanese dining spot with affordable prices and a pleasant atmosphere."

Herline at reception is very nice knows english well and also explains everything to us, She also help us to book taxi and suggest good indian restaurants near by. She is very very helpful.
Must stay here when you are in bali","We booked this place through Groupon. Booking was easy, the staff accomodating. The rooms are nice and clean. The service is great. It isn‚Äôt the greatest place to book in Bali, but well worth the price. Wifi is great. Food is delicious the cook can cook up a good feed. Small things such as water pressure in the shower were a pain but not really an issue to complain about. The only downfall is location. There‚Äôs not much around here and Seminyak central is a few Km away. With traffic, a drive to Seminyak square could take up to 20 mins to travel a 3-4km distance. Using Gojek ( like Uber) costs between $2-$5AU so it very cheap, make sure you pay the drivers more than the quoted amount they‚Äôre trying to earn a living so a few extra dollars won‚Äôt send you broke - same for the villa staff. They‚Äôre very friendly and accomodating. I would recommend this place if you‚Äôre looking for private accomodation at a bargain price.","Very hospitable staff.
The villa has a large room with great pool to relax in. Deep enough to have a decent swim. Their villas are named after mythological characters. Ours was Bima. They have a Ganesha idol at the entrance to the rows of villas. Being from India, it felt very rooted in our culture.
The complementary breakfast in the room was well arranged for.
The requested decorations were tastefully done.
But, there was no staff available to help us with the luggage while vacating the room early in the morning.
However, they had provided us breakfast boxes to eat on the go when we vacated. It was much necessary. Thanks a ton to the staff for arranging that!"

Overall this is one of pork recommendation you can find in Bali.","A good nasi jinggo! Their sweet braised pork is so good and a must try‚Ä¶ it is tender, sweetness is just right, and the caramelization is there, although the rice was already dry. Good enough for a late night meal.

It has 3 variants of price (10k, 15k, and 20k) and the payment can be using a QR code, ovo, gopay and cash

Unfortunately, you must be patient because it has a long queue","I give 5 star because they handle my order and correct (i cant eat spicy food so only 1 time i ask for not spicy and she come to my table to make sure that my order is correct.

Tried to extend for few days because didn't find a good another option yet. But ""the reservation team"" don't work as well.","Farther from the Denpasar airport and the room stay is not worth given the cab costs.

Overhyped reviews and pics on Agoda. The hotel/cottage is not at all maintained in a decent condition. Please refer to the pics below.

Poorly maintained rooms and bathrooms.
No locker facility.
Dirty pool.
Inefficient air conditioner.
Thin quilts.

I would highly recommend you stay away from this place unless you are on a budget. However, there are cheaper and better places than this one. Please don't be deceived by the photos on Google  or Agoda.",We have been staying here for years. Very quiet yet just of Raya Kerobokan. Water is not provided in the rooms but from a fountain in the office. Remember to bring some bottles to fill,"Not sure that it would be worth it at the normal price, but on the discounted price (under 150) it was comparable to other budget options in the area, just with a swimming pool.

I liked the thick towels, and the bedsheet was quite new.

Almost half of the lights in my room didn't work, but the main ones did, and the rest would be easy to fix if you are staying longer.

The room is probably meant for longer stays, because despite having a sink, fridge and gas stove, there were absolutely no cooking/eating/drinking utensils.

I borrowed a kettle at the front desk, but you have to switch the aircon off, otherwise it trips the power. (You can switch it on again, just outside the room.)

The aircon is effective enough to cool the room, but it works best if you keep the bathroom door closed."

‚Ä¢

It is absolutely not the same as on the pictures here or on booking or on agoda. Room is super old (on the pics it is new and nice). I paid for the superior room at the end got strange room with an ugly table and lots of smelly chemicals in it, which I asked to collect and get out from my room, because for the first time in my life I‚Äôve got allergic, it was hard to breath. And I can not open the window, because it‚Äôs Asia, you know, geckos, mosquitoes and etc. Also strong smell of the beer in the fridge.

Like the territory of the villa is ok, bed is fine, but everything else‚Ä¶","This is a cheap hotel for a reason. It's in need of maintenance and some TLC even though the pictures might make it look rather nice, there is often times no staff present, and the wifi is rather spotty in both coverage and speed. On a positive note, the room is mostly clean, the air conditioner in my room worked well and they bring you breakfast from a local restaurant every morning, though no earlier than 9am. Check-in was a bit confusing since no one is present in the front office, so you'll have to walk into the property and yell out hello and hope that someone hears you. One more thing: Apple Suites isn't found on Grab (though other Apple branded properties are), so if you want to use Grab, I recommend using the address of the restaurant next door."

I ordered their OG glazed breakfast. And you have to wait for 20 min for it. I wait for it and all the foods is included ice/hot americano.
Which is great!!

Then the OG glzd breakfast come then OMG! I think this is the first and the best in bali, its remind me when i get the luther burger in wynwood miami.

And the best of all is that we get free desserts like fruit salad, banana cake, glutinous rice porridge, omelette rolls with coconut inside.
The service is pretty good and friendly. Definitely recommended!!!","This lovely place has been here for years and do not disappoints.

There are many options of dishes from Indonesian, Chinese and western with generous portion and resonable price.

The staff are friendly and the service is quite fast.

Be informed that they only take cash as payment.","One of the greatest beef steaks in Bali. Keep me coming back every time I crave for a good piece of beef, which means almost 3 times week. Place looks a little worn down, but their Product is so good, So‚Ä¶Staff is very nice too. Very Good value for money on the menu, not overpriced at all.

I got a latte with almond milk and I really enjoyed it! I got the avocado toast which was with a very generous amount of avocado, love that!

Overall I really enjoyed the food! They had nice music playing, however, for me it was a bit to loud. I also think the price is higher compared to other spots. The location is also semi-optimal because its right next to a busy street. Overall enjoyed it but wouldn‚Äôt go again:)","Good food served with big smiles are the best. Highly recommend the curry chicken cabbage slaw on sourdough + pumpkin bread served with butter and sea salt ‚ô•Ô∏è
Seatings are comfy, my fav was the outward looking counter at the grocer area of the cafe overlooking the street amidst the traditional jamu scent. Thank you for a quaint and treasurely treat!","It may seem like a simple smashed avo toast, but it tastes rich, creamy, and seasoned perfectly!

It is no shocker that they use the freshest ingredients to craft their food.

The coffee was also on point.

Service was really friendly and the cafe is aesthetically comforting and cozy.

10/10 will go again.","Such a lovely place! Food and coffee are amazing, atmosphere is great. My favorite cafe in Kerobokan. Chicken curry toast is outstanding.","Saw the reviews here on google and decided to visit.
Latter is on point and avocado toast is nice! I ended up with their lemongrass something which was tasty as well.
Great place for work too."

I've been here 2 times and love the food. I highly recommend their biggest menu for sharing. Reservation is better coz sometimes they are full. The fish I got last time is too salty but the rest of the food is fine. I go here when I missed some German Food / European food. I would recommend for romantic dinner here.

Parking with car is a bit an issue but with motor bikes is better.","All considered this is probably the most affordable or good value  western restaurant I found in Seminyak/ Kerobokan/ Umalas area.

You can‚Äôt go wrong with schnitzel which priced at 100K. It was surprisingly ‚Ä¶. excellent!!!! . I highly recommended it and I wish you similar experience.

The Soto was the Dutch style, clear and mild tasting (missing the classic home fry potato chips/ crisp but you get other kind of crackers). It was loaded with chicken and Vegs. That‚Äôs a very happy and generous portion. FYI, if you had Soto  only during your Bali visits, this is the kind you have been having and they are better than many for this kind of Soto.

The potato curry soup is at your own risks and the goulash was ok if you have bad craving for it, otherwise try something else coz they have good food and good value. If it is goulash you are looking for there are other places near by for that.

The ambiance was simple, cozy, with small rice padi fields view. This place is so unpretentious and feels the old Bali. No bells, no whistles,  no aircon, no parking but they were prompt, friendly, clean facilities, and delivered values.","a really nice place, nice service, nice food. they serve german food. been here only twice, i love the pork steak, meatloaf, smoked roast pork üëç u can change the side dishes, i dont really like sauerkraut and changed it to mixed salad üëç

there are also asian and indonesian dishes but havent tried them yet.

the waiter and waitresses are so polite and warm :)","WOW have lived very close for 13 months but never been here.
Amazing German food had the Currywurst just fantastic.
The interior is lovely and the service so friendly.
The price is just so cheap for the beautiful food.
Incrediblely impressed will be back.","The menu offered a diverse selection of classic German dishes, each bursting with authentic flavors.
I opted for the Kasseler, Kartoffelp√ºree, Sauerkraut, or Smoked Pork-Roast served with Mashed Potatoes & homemade Sour-Cabbage and it was perfectly cooked, tender on the inside, and smokey.
The sauerkraut and mashed potato complemented the main dish wonderfully.
The staff was attentive and friendly.
This authentic German restaurant captures the essence of German cuisine, making it a must-visit for anyone craving a taste of Germany. ‚ù§"

Away from all the hustle and bustle of the city and yet only 10 minutes by scooter from the center.
The accommodation with pool and cafe is magically beautiful, the staff is very caring and spoils you right from the start with small attentions.
The rooms are very large, definitely worth the price. Would recommend 100%",Beautiful new hotel down a quiet alley.

There was no other guest aside from us when we came.

They haven't got some of the things we wanted, so had to compromise with other dishes.

My caesar salad was very disappointing for the price. Sweet mayo as dressing, grated kraft cheddar (which is not cheese at all), fried wonton skin as crutons, bits of chopped what I think was chicken.

At least the gado-gado and chicken steak with mushroom sauce my friends had were nice.

There was only one staff, she was friendly. And I guess a cook in the kitchen.

Place was spacious and the view would have been great during the day I guess.","Nice food and ambiance, with beautiful padi fields view, excellent, the service beyond expectations, thanks",I do very recommend to try bbq. They have bbq at weekend's. And must to say - the chief knows how to meat. Very tasty. As well they have good live music at Saturday evening,"I came here because of the location and it‚Äôs is lovely in the paddy field. There was also a tango lesson going on which was nice.

I had the gado gado. It was reasonably  priced but I waited 25 minutes from ordering for it to come. I thought a little too long and the gado gado itself was just underwhelming.  Put in a tiffin it was more gimmick than substance!

Staff were great - can‚Äôt complain at all, but I just wasn‚Äôt impressed with the food.","Perfect location, not too far from the center but quiet enough to get the feel of Bali, rice field view

Prices of the drinks and foods are not really expensive and have a good taste.
The DJ is good also.

But One thing that needs to be paid attention to is the ventilation of the room which I feel is not good because in a moment the whole room is filled with cigarette smoke which of course made my eyes sting.
