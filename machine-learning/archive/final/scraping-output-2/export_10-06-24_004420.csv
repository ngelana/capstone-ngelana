It was as if my name was called out and I had to stop. I don't know what these pretty green things are called but they are delicious and filling.

Lovely hosts and great food with an amazing view. Worth the visit if you're nearby,"Excellent food and wonderful hosts!

My girlfriend and I are from Australia and she wanted see Balinese cooking so the chef brought all the ingredients out to the main table and let her watch and participate in the food preparation. They discussed ingredients and cooking techniques which she loved.

The food was really fantastic, lots of flavours and smells, we will always remember this meal. They played Balinese musical instruments while we ate and it was quite special.

We would definately recommend Warung D'Subak Bakas to any travellers wanting to try local Balinese food, the food was better than the expensive restaurants in Ubud.

The chef answered all of our questions and we had really interesting discussions. All of the staff were very friendly. The scenery was picturesque and surrounded by flower gardens.

This was our favorite restaurant during our Bali holiday.

Would highly recommend A+",Refreshing dessert before heading back to ubud.,"Everything is good,,, they have view,  food,  and welcome,, I like that","Cool place with nice view. Local culture, friendly staff."
