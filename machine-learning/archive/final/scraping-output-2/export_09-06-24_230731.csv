Friendly host as well.   I've been here a few times now and so far it's been great.  Camping for a couple nights with great views of nearby mountains and to the south city lights in the distance.  Great place to bring the kids who can play to their heart's content all day long.  The owners also provide a fire pit and wood. A 10 min drive away is the main road to Bedugul where you will find restaurants and mini marts.  Walking distance from the camp is a huge forest offering great walks.,Really well organised camping ground with all the needed facilities.,Awesome camping experience! Great mountain view and fresh air
