The sunset from this warung is spectacular. Just wait for a plane landing and flying between your camera and sun...then shot.  Beautiful","Great place to eat seafood. Really good price, especially for the clams. Would recommend the garlic butter oysters.

Cons: place is small so reservation is recommended, no access to beach - feels a bit cramped, area to wash hands is very small","Best seafood we had in Bali. Facing the beach, beautiful sunset. Chefs here really can manage the perfection in cooking seafood. Taste is top notch.
Live oysters clam and crab are really good. Much better than the other.
Big big recommend to everyone. Even though the traffic is terrible but it is worth a try!","Amazing seafood place. Really near the airport. Decent price. Went there at dinner and it's already pretty packed. You need reservation for seats here. If you're close to the place definitely must go. If you're far from the place, you should try this still. We went all the way from Canggu to here and it was worth it! Our favorite was definitely the Garlic Butter Oyster. My personal favorite was the Garlic prawn. The sambals was to die for.","I saw a celebgram's review, and said this restaurant is delicious and cheap. Actually, the price is cheap, the seafood is fresh. But the seasoning was lacking, the blackpepper flavour was weird. And the grill seasoning contains shrimp paste, so it changes the flavour a bit."

Seafoods were fresh and grilled to the right point that they were still moist but cooked.
Helpful staff and lovely dinner environment. A must for sunset dinner with your love one.","Came here for sunset dinner and I wasn't disappointed! Tables set on the beach with a stage featuring traditional Balinese dance. We ordered seafood basket with lobster, the lobster was ok-ish, but the steamed grouper was delightfully delicious! Prices are reasonable for the food and the vibe provided there.","Bawang Merah Beachfront Restaurant in Bali offers a truly unforgettable dining experience. The staff here are exceptional, showcasing the warmth and hospitality Bali is famous for. Every guest is treated like family, ensuring a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere.

It's a nice place with fewer people than Menega and more affordable prices. They offer a wide variety of seafood, but no lobster. You can get shrimp, fish, clams, crab, vegetables, and roasted corn with many sauce options. I recommend visiting with family or friends who love seafood.

The taste was just average but still nice. The service takes a little time, around 30 to 40 minutes. Some types of seafood were out of stock.","This is a very popular spot for locals, as a tourist, we just felt very fortunate to have a local friend recommended us this spot to check out. It’s a seafood grill place that is by the beach. I would definitely give a 5 for the vibe and the view. It’s very chill and comfy at night time. For service, staffs are nice but the service speed was way slower than our expectation, we ordered at 7pm but food didn’t come until almost 8pm, which we were like starving at that point…the food is good, slightly more tender/dry than our preference for seafood, but we loved the oyster and the spice/seasoning! Strongly recommend you check this place out before all the other tourists discover this gem!","Nice place, beautiful sunset, yummy, fresh and cheap seafood. Local friend introduced us to come here. We spend IDR 320,000 for 2 persons. It’s great!","Favourite food place South of the Airport. Great views and good prices for seafood. Buskers abound as well, though from my observation some seem sneer people who give lesser tips.

In my opinion, they are earning way more than sufficient, would recommend giving tips to the local workers who earn minimum wages instead.","Nice place to see sunset nearby the airport.. the ambience is nice but honestly the f&b is simple, not too special in taste but all items is quite cheap compare with other places in kedonganan - jimbaran area.

The only feedback to the management: I know beach club’s business is not cheap. But 100K for 4 small slices of tapas style pizza is definitely a rip off. You probably can do better than this. Please be more reasonable with your pricing. Thanks !

Food is delicious btw.","Great location and view, amazing food and best service we found in Bali! We came for lunch and I'd definitely suggest coming!
Nice relaxing music as well.","Want to keep this place a secret but they deserve the review. Loved it, food was great, cocktails best I had on my 10 day trip to Bali and service was beyond exceptional.
I was there on a Monday evening so was quiet which I loved but can imagine has perfect vibe on a busier day/night.
Super clean amenities including showers.
Was perfect end to my trip before heading to airport. which is only a few minutes away.
Have already recommended to friends and will definitely be back!","Deserve more visibility. Jimbaran mixed with Côte d’Azur vibes, perfect match. They have a nice music playlist with a mix of chill house and variété française ;)

Spent an entire afternoon until sunset and witnessed a top notch service and delicious food & cocktails. Big fan of their clams.

Very correct price for what you get. Would avoid overrated beach clubs and come here instead to chill on their sunbed. Perfect for solo, couple and even for family.

Staffs & management are nice and helpful. Mille mercis !","We spent a great Sunday fun day at Azure. We could not have asked for more.  Amazing spot for families to meet together.  Lots of space in the shade to sit and hang out, a beautiful pool, and the best part was the beach.  Amazing blue water ocean, white sand and safe for the kids.  The venue being higher than the beach makes it great for us adults to check the children.  Food was delicious ( they even have a kids menu for little ones ). Lots of straight forward flavors, super fresh fishes and seafood, and the most yummy desserts I have had so far in Bali (and I am not a sweet tooth person).  The organic chicken 'a la provencale ' is soo tasty, baked oysters are just a delight and we enjoyed the seafood tower and char-grilled lobster.  Lets not forget the gazpacho; everyone loves a cold soup on a hot day.
Sunset is totally another vibe and makes it a perfect addition to such a great day!"

The beach itself was crowded when I arrived. I walked along the shore and apparently there are many small local ships harbored there. The sand is so soft, but there are also many small corals(?)/stones, so it hurts a bit when you walk along the shore. I also noticed quite a few thrashes! But overall, it was a good experience! Oh, there is also the view of planes taking off!","Kelan beach is wonderful!
This beach is really near with the airport. So you can see the plane ✈️ that is going to landing in Bali Airport in the right area of this beach.
Meanwhile in the left area of the beach, you can see the big statue of GWK.
How awesome, right?

Amazing experience, amazing sunset as well. Not too busy compared with other well known beach in Bali.
Many local beach club as well with a very reasonable price!","A nice beach that not too crowded. The best thing about this place is some good restos that serve many kind of seafoods, and the price is very reasonable. Good parking area as well, not as random as some other beaches.

You can also enjoy the wave and ask them to look after your seat (with one condition, they wont be responsible for any lost and your belongings will always be your responsibility). Of course they are not the same as beach club where they dont provide neither music nor mocktails here. Nonetheless, you can still enjoy sunset and seafood worth the price.
