We’ve booked one of the pool villas and several day trips with the Wakanda. The gardens are out of this world, amazing beautiful and what makes this place so unique. Very peaceful spot to stay. You can feel the local culture staying here.","This was a great experience from start to finish. The Wakanda is a relatively new resort and yet they provide service like they’ve been doing this for decades. Every single person that works here is so friendly and goes above and beyond in providing customer service. The resort is also beautifully decorated and I was able to truly relax.

There are so many amazing amenities including an on-site restaurant, spa and infinity pool. My favorite part was being able to sit poolside and order food and drinks. Everything came out of the kitchen super fast and super fresh.

I was a little worried about coming solo but I felt super comfortable and safe. This is definitely solo travel friendly and a great way to treat yourself while staying within budget.

I’d also like to give a special shout-out to Adi who worked the front desk. He was super friendly and was able to make sure my stay was super comfortable.

I hope to be back some day!","Absolutely beautiful place. Bath was wonderful (with ample hot water, which isn't true everywhere in Bali!). Staff and service is very good as well.

The pool was warm and had a fantastic view, and the food in the restaurant is pretty good.

Internet works well, as does the air conditioning. The room is spacious and hasovely architecture.

I'd just warn that the noise isolation between rooms is not great so you are a bit at the mercy of your neighbours (and unfortunately for me, mine were talking and laughing loudly until 3am) - but I could have complained to the hotel and I choose not to and just used the provided ear plugs.",This was the perfect stay for me. The resort staff were absolutely gorgeous such kind humans. The yoga was a great inclusion and I get a free 15min massage. The spa was divine the ladies there were incredible. The view from the terrace restaurant was stunning. Everything was perfect. Room with an amazing bath - wow!,"We really enjoyed our two night stay at the Wakanda! The rooms are beautiful and spacious, with a private feeling and gorgeous views of rice paddies from the pool area. The room was extremely tidy and well equipped, but definitely the highlight of our stay were the friendly staff. Ayu from the restaurant and her colleagues were absolutely lovely, and she went above and beyond for us! The restaurant food was tasty and well priced. Summer the duty manager was also very friendly and helpful during check in and all activities. The location is a few kilometres out of the main town, but it is easy to ride there via Grab and we enjoyed the peacefulness of the resort"

The resort was just the right place to unwind and relax.
Calm surroundings, serene environment.
It does lack a few things but all that was laid to rest with the superior hospitality from the Resort. The little things were taken care off. The staff are very hospitable, Endless good things to right about the Balinese Hospitality. Had a wonderful 2 nights stay at this beautiful property. If you find the food expensive.. there is Mamas Kitchen at less then a KM away at the main road intersection.

The resort does need a few improvements:
The Dispensers in the Shower need to be wall mounted.
The Coin soaps to be replaced with dispenser hand wash.
A Gym is a need and some indoor activities as there are tourists who come with families.
A pen & Paper in the rooms
Breakfast needs a bit more... Sausages/ Salamis would be good.","A very calm and peaceful resort that's located away from the hustle of the city.
We had taken the Private Pool Villa, room was spacious and pool was in good condition. There was an issue with lighting during out stay, but it was promptly fixed when notified.
Food is good, but it's subjective. The complimentary breakfast offers multiple options so it will be good in general.
Service in person is good but we had trouble getting them to respond to calls from our room.
Keep in mind on the location though, it's quite remote, not many shops or places nearby, a taxi or rented vehicle is a must to explore outside of the resort. There is a shuttle to central Ubud if that would suffice.","Potentially a nice hotel but during our three weeks stay there were constant construction works and the respective noise level was unacceptable. After speaking to the management nothing really changed because they said they had to finish building new bungalows. I would recommend specifically asking about construction works prior to booking!!

The staff was incredibly friendly and kind. Breakfast very good relative to local standards.",Me and my husband really enjoyed our stay at the resort in our private villa room  . It is a bit far from main tourist attractions but renting a scooter was convenient and easily got us around so we rather enjoyed being a bit away frim the centre. Loved it.,"Poor food, not good in taste and very poor service.

Poor service during Breakfast buffet. They don’t refill the food on time, which waste so much of our time.

I have ordered some food in my room, and i went to restaurant to pay off my bill.
They forgot to give me my last bill and they made me pay that bill at 10 50pm when i was sleeping.

Very poor customer service. I will definitely not come back to stay in this property."

We stayed for 9 nights as two adults and a two year old to relax and unwind and were really happy with all elements of the accommodation.","The wifi here was horrible, complained and it wasn’t fixed. This was unfortunate because we were here to work remotely! It was such an inconvenience for us everyday as my husband had to leave and work elsewhere. They kept telling us to connect to different rooms but even then it didn’t work on any computers/phones, etc. If you’re planning on doing anything with wifi, I would suggest a different hotel.

We thought the 20-30 min hike to central Ubud meant the villa would be a quiet oasis but it wasn’t. The walls were paper thin, anytime our neighbors talked we could hear them, and there wasn’t much privacy - was surprised this wasn’t in more reviews. All the rooms face the pool and if there are any kids on property - best of luck. It was basically like we were sleeping outside.

The rooms were ordinary and orderly. The staff were kind and welcoming as they always are in Indonesia!","Super clean and new, nice ambiance. Far away from everything but Bali is driver sight seeing depending. So no big deal location, 10 min lose at most. Good location to stay 2-3 days for central island and Ubud visits.","OMG , I loved the staff and their hospitality. They were absolutely nice, and their service was on the top
When it comes to location, I like to talk a bit more
I would say it depends on your intention. If you wanna place the super quiet middle of nowhere and no noise is 5 out of 5.
supermarket or anything thw you lotentially might need is 15-20 minutes drive away from you
Being close to supermarket and ubud Street was matter to me, do I am giving them 3 🙃
But it was safe.","This place is perfect, away from the hustle and bustle of Ubud and approximately 20-30 minutes to the centre by scooter or car depending on traffic. If you are travelling with more than one person and you’re willing to brave the Balinese traffic chaos, it might be worth while hiring a car for the duration of your stay but I found it easier to hire drivers, all of whom were extremely reliable. The rooms and grounds are immaculately clean and the staff are so professional and kind; they could not be more helpful. Restaurant menu is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Villa Mirah. Highly recommend."

Located in ricefields (note that you will need motorbike which you can rent on the reception ), 20 min from Ubud center and 20 minutes from black sand beaches of the east. Quiet picturesque ambient, nested in ricefields, nice clean rooms, amazing bed, superb service.","Amazing place to stay at Ubud, pool is clean. We arrived early, but they let us check in. Service is good, clean bathroom. Hot water anytime. Love this place and will definitely comeing back here in the future","Great energy vibes along the area, paddy fields view, Mountains view, close to river and friendly and helpful village community. Great living for staycation, long stay/retirement time or just relaxing and practicing meditation/yoga.

This' new building villa with huge space to live, and friendly staff will take care of you. Affordable price and included breakfast. Highly recommended 🤠👌✨👍👍👍","Nice paddy field view, good rooms for the price and good massage service at Rp 150,000 an hour."

They took good care to accommodate my dietary needs (dairy free and vegetarian) and were more than happy to create special meals for meal. The portions were huge. Highly recommend the noodles and the Wakanda breakfast. Great western options too when I felt like something my stomach is more used to. The attendants took the time to explain how dishes and drinks were prepared to I ended up learning lots about Balinese food. Would be happy to never level the resort and eat here for days,"We had a two night stay here and enjoyed afternoon tea and breakfast both days. The afternoon tea had a small selection of traditional Balinese cuisine: corn, sweet potato and pancake. There were many set menus to choose from breakfast. All plentiful and delicious. The staff were exceptional and were happy to offer recommendations for what to do around the area. Food service was a bit slow on one day, but other than that, it was amazing!","My partner and I took the Balinese cookery class today with Surya & Rolan (our chefs). Both were very professional and showed us how the Balinese cooking is done to perfection. The outdoor traditional Balinese kitchen has an amazing view of the rice fields. We were stuffed by the end of it, having a 3 course meal of soup, main and dessert. All very tasteful. Wira - our assistant who also works in the restaurant went out of his way to help, assist and sometimes translate (his English is really good). We highly recommend not only the restaurant but The Wakanda too.","I stayed for 2 nights and was the best time I had in my trip, the resort  is beautiful, all facility nice and clean, the bedroom as large and comfortable, all staffs  are nice, kind very helpful always with a beautiful smile in special Yanti she was incredible making me feel very special. I strongly recommend this place for who wants a special and beautiful memories.","We were staying at another villa down the road and we came down at lunch to sit by the pool, the friendly reception staff had told us about the Indonesian buffet they were serving for dinner later that night so we had to come back, and were glad we did! The food was delicious, live music and the staff were so smiley and happy! Next time we will stay at the villa so we can eat at the restaurant everyday! Really recommend eating here for a meal, even if you’re not staying at the villas."

The villa is very well maintained and clean.
Eka and Wuyan are very helpful and were responsive to all our queries and requests.
There is a hotel adjacent where you can also get rental cars and bikes.
The view from the villa is of paddy fields and quite beautiful.
The pool is clean and well kept.
There is a functional kitchen with the basic utensils which was helpful for us. Alternatively you can also use the restaurant behind the villa. There can be mosquitoes at night so keep doors closed after sunset and also carry repellent creams.
It's a very peaceful place and there are 3/4 villas adjacent, so would not recommend for partying. It's more for families who want a peaceful stay admist the fields.","Spacious 3BR 2storey villa in Ubud area. The location is not the best if you rely on your foot, but still in a comfort distance if you use bike or car. The villa is quite in a good shape but the floor a bit giving you a sense of ""heavy"" after you go around the premise.
1 room has an AC issue but Pak Wayan take care of it by calling the technician, although it's still not meet my cold preference but i appreciate the prompt response.
The hospitality of the staffs is top notch, they will do the best they can to please you.
If you happen to find this villa but you have doubt whether to try it or not, i recommend you to.
I have a wonderful 2 nights stay. Thank you RC Ubud and staffs..",RC ubud villa very good,Surrounded by green view,
