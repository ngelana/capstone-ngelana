What a lovely place and what a lovely people. We started with a coffee and tea with some small bites. Then we got a tour through the beautiful garden giving nice information about the different trees and plants. Then we learned how to make a basket from bamboo followed by a very nice lunch.

This is absolutely a good thing to do if you’re in or around Lovina. Don’t forget to buy the palm sugar and the coffee! You will love it!","Go visit here. It is a must! The owner/guide is friendly informative and funny. It is a family run enterprise and gives a really local feel. It is so charming. The food is great. So much to see in a gorgeous setting. Steep steps and no handrails though.
Get coffee here!","Wonderful, authentic experience! A local family and community, including the kindest people you can think of, welcome you with excellent locally-grown coffee, tea and traditional snacks, show you through the beautiful field where they grow all sorts of exotic fruits and plants, explain the coffee-roasting process and the local traditions, teach you how to craft colourful Balinese baskets, and prepare THE MOST delicious local food, cooked by local villagers. Perfect for souvenirs too: you can buy Balinese baskets made on the spot and have them personalised, as well as little or bigger bags of their amazing coffee. Highly recommended!","The most charming visit you could imagine. Family run organic coffee plantation and kitchen garden. Set on a ridge in the clouds. See how coffee is grown, harvested, and roasted. Have a go at basket weaving and finish with a traditional lunch. You will not be disappointed. 5-stars.","We stopped here on the way to Lovina to get out of the rain, and glad we did! Beautiful coffee/tea and banana fritters. The male host is very hospital and friendly. The scenery is also quite serene and peaceful."
