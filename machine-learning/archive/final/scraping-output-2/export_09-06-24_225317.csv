Highly Recommended Hotel

I had an amazing experience at this hotel, and I can't recommend it enough. From the moment I stepped in, I was impressed by the warm and welcoming atmosphere.

The staff deserves a special mention for their exceptional service. They were incredibly friendly, attentive, and went above and beyond to ensure our comfort. The attendants were always available and responsive to our needs.

Overall, this hotel exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It was an exceptional experience, and I will definitely return for another stay. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a memorable and comfortable stay.","Hands down our best stay in Bali. The venue is absolutely fantastic, incredible views, amazing staff and superb food. The room was fully equipped and comfortable. The location is perfect since you are next to the jungle, far from the tourist massification. I highly recommend renting a scooter (the hotel staff can get you one delivered at your door for a fair price) and explore the different waterfalls inside the jungle.","I am in love with these luxurious cabins in the heart of Munduk! It was challenging to find a place that met my expectations, but Munduk Cabins turned out to be the best choice. The cabins are incredibly spacious, we opted for the 2-bedroom option, a two-story structure with an amazing pool and jungle views. The interior features earthy colors with some modern additions. The staff is professional and polite, and we could easily order anything via WhatsApp. The location is conveniently close to waterfalls, rice terraces, and other attractions. I felt so relaxed after spending two days there. I highly recommend Munduk Cabins to anyone visiting this area.","I would give 6 stars. One of our favourite places in Bali. It‚Äôs the small details that make the difference like little marshmallows and hot chocolate in rooms, and a turn down service which is always a sign of a classy hotel. Such a vibe. We did a trip with group of friends and our baby and it was perfect. They even have a Canggu Monopoly with good selections of wine to enjoy the change of scenery üçÇüå≤","We stayed here for a couples retreat in June 2023. The cabins were beautiful and well equipped, set in an atmospheric and peaceful location high in the Indonesian mountains, with views across the canopy. It‚Äôs remote but that‚Äôs part of the beauty and there are still attractions within driving distance, which the hotel will help to arrange. The restaurant and room service also produced amazing and diverse food so you don‚Äôt need to venture out for food. During our stay, I suffered an unfortunate medical situation when I collapsed at a nearby waterfall and was hospitalised. The hotel staff went above and beyond, helping to carry me up the valley to safety and transporting me onwards to a hospital. Their efforts didn‚Äôt stop there, making sure me and my partner had everything we needed at the hospital. It‚Äôs the best service I‚Äôve ever received from hotel staff and I wouldn‚Äôt be exaggerating to say they saved my life. I hope to return one day and enjoy the experience to its fullest. Thank you Munduk Cabins üôè"

The menu is short but it would satisfy most palates with enough variety for 2 night stays.  The food was delicious and the cocktail was good. Anyway, the drink menu has nice variety from traditional tonic to all sorts of cocktails. I didn‚Äôt expect such good quality food for being in the area but this place has it all figured out. The ambiance was warm, quiet, calm, and simple. Basically the menus are in the similar vibe as the restaurant. The  service was friendly.","We found out about this place online and was eager to try the food, it did not disappoint. Every single dish was full of flavour, perfectly presented and well balanced. We were greeted with a welcome drink and canape, the service was very friendly and efficient. The restaurant itself is in beautiful surroundings, nestled between lots of greenery and perfect for watching the sunset. Being a pastry chef, it's hard to choose between the desserts as they all sounded amazing. The banoffee pie was very rich and creamy but delicious, there are also lighter options to choose from such as fruit. Overall a very positive experience, would definitely revisit if in the area!","During my stay at Munduk Cabins, I visited Ulekan and was impressed with their authentic Indonesian flavors. Dishes like gado gado, sate tamu, rendang terong, and urap urap were delicious. The restaurant has a stylish interior, ideal for a relaxing evening or a pleasant lunch, and professional and welcoming service. I look forward to trying more dishes on my next visit and recommend Ulekan to anyone in Munduk.","Though this restaurant has a luxury interior but I feel very homey and relaxing having dinner here. They served delicious authentic Indonesian food. Surprisingly, the nasi goreng probably my favorite and the ikan pepes. The mas banana coconut toffee caramel is the best! You should order that to complete your culinary journey at Ulekan!","We arrived to a beautiful building in the middle of nowhere! Welcomed with lemon tea and a canope once we were sat. We ordered two house Ros√® and it was very nice wine considering it was there cheapest. The food was lovely, and staff were very friendly! It's reasonably priced too considering the decor and the service you receive!"

The design of the cabin is incredible, and the views are unmatched ‚Äî particularly its view of sunset. I had the best sleeps in the comfortable bed and super soft bedding. It was the perfect location to host a girl‚Äôs birthday weekend away with the communal living room space, the pool, and fire pit area to hang out in/around. We also had the BBQ buffet on our second night and it was well-priced and delicious. Highly recommend and can‚Äôt wait to be back.","Absolutely in love with this place!

The cabin looks out of a magazine, plus it has the most comfy bed everrrrr. The views are breathtaking, the staff is very attentive and we had a delicious bbq around the fire pit ‚Äî all that we needed.
Ps. There are also some waterfalls near by!","We had the most magical stay at the cabin - possibly one of the most serene places I‚Äôve stayed in Bali. The cabin itself is so very lush & cozy, and the view is absolutely surreal. Wish we could have stayed for a month!","My favorite place to go and get into some cold fresh air. Amazing view, fire pit and hot tub as well. Hendra and the staff are wonderful and the Duma cabin was decorated for class and comfort. The restaurant wasn‚Äôt open yet but the subset bbq is a must.",The cabin is stunning! It's a perfect place to getaway from busy life and we had a wonderful weekend here ‚ô•Ô∏è will surely come back!
