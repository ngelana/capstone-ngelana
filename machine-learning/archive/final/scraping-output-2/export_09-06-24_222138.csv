The local guide mentioned that this place resembles the hills in Avatar and thus call this place Balinese Avatar. I love the trail and the lush forests. You will also meet many locals who barely speak Indonesian language along this trail. It‚Äôs a highly recommended hill to hike in North Bali.,"Bukit Mende is one of those hidden gems that come around once in a blue moon. Up till now it has only really been known to locals, and was ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù by outsiders only very recently. Not much is known about the place other than some photos of amazing views that have popped up on social media. We therefore took it upon ourselves to seek out this mysterious hilltop in order to bring you, our readers, some more information about it. Of course, WE were very interested and champing at the bit to check it out as well!  Bukit Mende is in the Kintamani area, but is quite a distance removed from anywhere you might already associate with Kintamani.

To get to Bukit Mende, head up to Kintamani from Ubud via whichever road you like until you read the Batur Caldera Rim. From there, take the road west along the rim, past Pura Ulun Danu Batur, and make like you are heading for Singaraja. Once you reach Pura Puncak Penulisan you will veer to the right, ignoring the majority of traffic that go left toward Singaraja. Up to here Google maps will still be leading you the right way.","Amazing place and one of my favorite in Bali! Wonderful views. Make certain to ask directions if you are unsure as it can be confusing on maps. (An article on my website gives directions). The trek out to the Bukit isn't difficult, and the entire trail makes you feel like you are walking in the clouds. Definitely worth the visit.","HEAVEN!!!
My last day in Bali, i hit this jackpot. Visiting this amazing hill, were you can walk in the top of it and enjoy the magnificent view around you. When i get there the weather and air are so misty, so its like the whole place is Heaven out of no where.

To get here u need courage and faithful, its not easy, the road are small just fit for one car only, so the best possible way is using motorcycle, but you also need to be careful the road are up and down most 45¬∞ above.

If you come from South, find this Puncak Penulisan Hindu Temple. From there, there will be 2 road left and right(straight forward) take the right(straight forward) road and then your journey will begin. Local people there doesn't call it Bukit Mende, i forgot what they call it, but just ask about a hill where everyone goes to visit, they will know what u talk about. This hill is located in the last village in that area, and where the road end.","PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU GO‚ö†Ô∏è
The way down can be really steep and you will have to use the breaks the entire time. Make sure your breaks work on the bike‚ö†Ô∏è

Otherwise, its a really beautiful place to visit, we were the only people there the whole day, so you dont have to worry about crowdsüòú

Its free to go there, but on the way there, about 30 minutes before, there will be a Check Point where they sell you tickets to enter the Road. Only TOURISTs have to pay itüí≤

Also, we got stopped by a local claiming there was Police barricade 5km up and that they will charge us 500k each. He then pursue to guide us to a place that we should wait for 20 minutes until Police is finished. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SCAM, DO NOT FALL FOR ITüòú We just kept driving and there was No Police waitingü§£only the one for tickets, but they are 31küòä"
