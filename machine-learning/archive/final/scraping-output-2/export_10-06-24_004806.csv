It was the absolute best experience ever!  The property is gorgeous, the rooms are so luxurious, the food is delicious and healthy, the vibe is so fun, there are so many fabulous activities and tours to enjoy, and the location is wonderful for exploring the Ubud area. But what really makes Soulshine extra special is the people. I have never experienced such kind, genuine, wonderful service.  Every single team member we met Soulshine is amazing!  They each had a smile for us every moment, and went over and above to meet our wants and needs.

Being a retreat host can be quite stressful...but Soulshine took all the stress away from the moment I arrived. They took care of everything for me and all of my guests.  I truly did not want to leave!  And I can't wait to go back!  When you arrive they say  ""welcome home"", and it really does feel like home.  Thank you Michael and Sara, for creating such an incredible place and for choosing such a wonderful team.  My retreat at Soulshine exceeded all of my expectations, hopes, and dreams!","My wife and I had an incredible stay at Soulshine - we were the panoramic room and enjoyed waking up to the most beautiful green views. It was so serene and we loved sitting on the balcony at sunset. The room itself is huge and bed so comfortable.

The team at Soulshine are so friendly and hospitable, and made us feel at home. So many little thoughtful touches. We love the food and drinks.. and explored the property (make sure you walk past their farm).

Thank you Soulshine for a wonderful stay.",Love this place. We used to go here regularly. Unfortunately kids can no longer use the pool and so only adults will be able to use the swing and the slide. I understand it is because of the concept that Soulshine is a wellness hotel. I am sorry kids are missing out on this wonderful environment and we as parents will not be going there anymore.,"I have led yoga retreats around the world, and never have I had an experience like I had recently with my group at Soulshine - it far exceeded all of my expectations! From the moment my group showed up to the property we were made to feel welcome, respected, and cared for. The staff is so friendly and learned everyone in our group's names, always asking after our daily excursions and how we were doing.

The food was unbelievable! Each meal was different, delicious, and delightful. We were all saying how much we would miss the food when we left. Our group did a Balinese cooking class with the head chef, and it was amazing - I highly recommend!

The three yoga studios on the property were perfect for our daily mediation and yoga, and were always set up beautifully for us each morning and afternoon. The flower mandalas they set up for us were break-taking, and the sound system and props are modern and high quality.

We all had spa treatments when we were there, and many of of us added on more after we had one, because they were that good. The therapists are professional, friendly, and talented.

There are many choices for accommodation and each option is gorgeous and comfortable. I loved my room, which had a balcony overlooking the rice paddies, and a huge tub!

I cannot say enough good things about Soulshine, but their attention to detail and warmth is unsurpassed.","Soulshine Bali is an oasis and haven, we had the best week there in January. The attention to detail and care, love and positive vibes continuously blew us away. The staff are incredible, so kind, warm and helpful, the food is delicious, the spa treatments were some of the best we ever had, it's pure class and joy at Soulshine. Can't wait to go back."

We visited the restaurant for dinner. The food options are plenty, as well as drinks and reasonable price in comparison to the establishment. The place just mesmerizing with plants, trees, ponds of kois, and big stage inside. The food however not that special for us. Taste fine but not great. Service is superb.","Last Wednesday, we found ourselves in a enormous thunderstorm and Wedja was our oasis. Friendly welcoming people gave us an umbrella for the walk through their lovely garden. We've sat here a couple of hours enjoying great food and coffee, very welcoming.","Set in a beautiful space, this restaurant and workspace is out of this world. Beautifully green with a lotus pond to boot, the food is authentic and spicy (if you dare), with very warm, welcoming staff who will respond to any of your food requests. We spent a lovely afternoon here away from the hustle and bustle of the ubud city centre and we‚Äôre all the better for it. We had the grilled fish, lamb soup, and grilled clams. Sensational.","Another way to experience the sunset in a much calmer place in Ubud area. You will definitely enjoy the scenery. I was searching for a place to have a coffee with a nice view and that's how we ended up in wedja bali.

If you are someone who struggles walking you may find it a challenge as the path in their entrance has lots of sharpy gravel. With high hopes given the great ratings, I was a bit disappointed to find it was good but nothing special. The Jaje Bali was fine but no better than it should be at these prices. The staff were lovely but one of their waitress, named Desak, was unfriendly and lacking basic service attitude (no smiling face, no genuine gesture).

Very much hope that the owner will discuss my feedback for better improvement.","Such a gorgeous space to dine. beautiful javanese doors and just cozy space and great options of food and tasty, good price.

Highly recommended üòç"

But that's what makes it unique. It gives an experience of staying in a forest. The rooms are well kept and neat. Their infinity pool is amazing.
The food especially the vegetarian options were not that good but otherwise it was fine.","Lovely hotel, great location away from busy Ubud high street! Lovely pool overlooking a jungle forest! Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms were lovely and clean, and they even offer room service! Would highly recommend.","I had a very interesting experience. I was welcomed well by the staff and the room was decent. The view from the room in the second floor was great. Then I decided to extend my stay for a month and told them my budget. At first they agreed. They could not give me the same room, the alternative room, had less of a view but I was willing to compromise. After agreeing to take the place they suddenly said they can‚Äôt give me the room for the initial price I told them. This was 2 hours before my check out. I suddenly found myself searching for a place after I had canceled my alternative  options. This is not the way to treat people, it does not matter that it‚Äôs Bali. I hope it does not happen again.","Retreat is located about 15 minutes drive from the ubud city centre. There is a shuttle that takes you there and back for free twice a day. The floating breakfast was lovely. The place is clean and neat and housekeeping does a great job. The massages we had was also amazing. The staff at the retreat are always pleasant, friendly and helpful and the tour we did with the hotel was great. We learnt alot about Bali and Ubud from our driver/tour guide

Now for the negative: the food is below average apart from the nasi goreng and mie goreng. The breakfast options are also ala carte and basic. Fresh juice is an additional cost. We opted not to have our complimentary dinner during our stay because we tried the food once at dinner time and it was bland and tasteless with no seasoning at all. There are only 2 local meal items on the menu which is a shame as the chef does that well and is what he should stick to because the other items we ordered which was indian butter chicken and Thai Red curry was really bad but for a 6 night's stay we couldn't bring ourselves to eat nasi/mie goreng at breakfast and then again at dinner for that many days. For the price of the stay you could probably get a better hotel closer to the city center. The furniture and the retreat in general is dated and needs a face-lift.","Mayura Retreat Ubud is the perfect location for a family seeking tranquility amidst the lush Balinese greenery. This hotel offers a comfortable and spacious suite, ideal for our family of four. Our kids particularly enjoyed the toys provided in the dining area which kept them occupied while we savored the simple yet fulfilling breakfasts.

In our free time, we took advantage of the complimentary bike rentals and explored the charming neighboring villages. It was refreshing to experience firsthand the vibrant local cultures Bali has to offer. Furthermore, the hotel provides a shuttle service to the Ubud center, a mere 20-minute journey.

One of the highlights for us at this hotel was the rooftop terrace ‚Äì perfect for some early morning yoga with breathtaking views. Mayura Retreat Ubud is undeniably a restful getaway for any family."

As an added bonus, there‚Äôs also a semi-motorbike thematic going on. The food was good as was the service, also, not expensive. Well worth visiting","I came for JOJO the frenchie, stayed for everything else. Easily the best cafe on Bali, if not the best cafe I have ever been to. Great coffee and food, but INCREDIBLE atmosphere. A mixture of art and retro motorsport, a unique blend of design that is very rare. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone in Ubud, and is even worth a trip from other parts of Bali.",Spacious cafe and decent food. One noodle soup was nice and the other noodle soup was too sweet like a dessert. Food took around 45 min to arrive which felt slow when it wasn't busy. Cafe latte was good but the mango matcha was bad as it felt like frozen blended mango and the tastes did not go well together.,We stopped there for our lunch on our last day in Bali. The best food we had so far. The atmosphere is very good. Food was tremendous. Even my kid enjoyed their soupy noodles a lot.,"Every star is deserved. ‚≠êÔ∏è Smiling, peaceful, and attentive staff.

As shown in the picture, the ham was so dry and hard, and the meat was more than half the fat, so there was almost no food available, no food to eat.

I don't know if it'll be different if you go and eat it during mealtime, but I never recommend it.

Only view was nice.","Surprised by the great service! Valet service is top notch; they handle parking smoothly with just a key exchange. The atmosphere is incredibly comfortable and refreshing.

The whole team is super friendly and stands's endeavor to fulfill all wishes. There are also plenty of parking spaces available. Really a great cafe with everything you need. Can only recommend it to everyone who is in Ubud to come here, you will certainly not be disappointed üòä","We go to this restaurant often as it's close to our house. Generally the service is not very attentive, usually we have to call them if we want to order something, but it's common in Bali. They often forget part of the order, especially if you ask something extra (like tomato sauce, glass of water, etc.) and they spend most of the time looking to the phone or from the window instead of serving the guests. Yesterday's visit was disappointing too. I ordered mango juice that I returned because it tasted like rotten, but it's charged to me anyway. We ordered dadar guling (pancakes), it's cold and hard, we said it's not fresh and the waitress replied, it's from the morning...we came 6:30pm üôà At least she was honest. When we looked at her like if she's kidding, she took it and they made fresh for us. If you need a calm place for working/studying, I can't recommend it as it's right next to the main street so it's pretty noisy there. There's no AC inside. But there're many places for sitting, I can recommend coffee, passion fruit juice, BBQ beef burger, chicken lollipops, platters for sharing. If you're hungry, don't go for pasta or salad as these are very small portions but it matches the price. I like the passion fruit deco outside and that's green and feel spacious. Overall, it's not very bad but it's not super great either.","I walk with no plan, but this coffee shop trigger me to visit, so i sit and order, breakfast time, i believe there is more choice for lunch and dinner, love the vibe, affordable price and lovely music...terima kasih .."

Most buildings have a real roof but the 2 studio apartments at the end have a flat roof and you can see the cracks and bubbles from moisture in the ceiling.

We were 4 people and the only place we could eat was on the roof which is 2 storeys up.

There are few things to make your pleasant stay. IPTV, Good Wifi, Nice Landscape and view, Comfy sofas and Furniture, AC

Breakfast is pricey for basic omelette and juice 100k per person.

Kitchen has no proper cooking stove to prepare meals, better if owner can put one grill outdoor or on the roof.

Location is not very centeal and not safe to walk from villa especially at night.

I am not a favor to toilets concept open to nature, every time we access ground floor toilets we have to deal with flies, lizards, mosquitoes and FROGS. just randomly frogs sitting on toilet seat, shower and roof. They are noisy at night too.

The fish pool is a nice addition.

Would be useful if they put a table with chairs near the pool.

The staff are very attentive and helpful and they try to help as much as possible.

If you planning to cook then bring some basic ingredients and prepare to use small pans and pots.. and basically single spot electric conviction device. There is a small grilling oven and microwaves but the place is made in 3 floors with 3 different kitchens and each kitchen has different equipment.

Every detail is beautiful. The shower with the window open to outdoors is heavenly! It is a very serene and calm place. I would highly recommend Amrit B&B,"Amrit B&B is a beautiful serene place where you feel at home. Spacious and tastefully made rooms, good breakfast served with love. Wayan and his family are lovely and kind people and make your stay very comfortable and warm. This our second time here and we highly recommend Amrit if you want to stay in Ubud. The location is also very strategic.",Amrit is a hidden gem in the heart of Ubud. Thisnis my second stay! The owners and staff are gracious and attentive. They offer airport transfers and free transport around the local town! Breakfast is also included with stay. They are building a new suite and pool. I'm looking forward to returning next year!,Best stay in the Ubud Area! Super welcoming and friendly people! It's also home for a wood carving shop so you can see how some of these amazing creations are being made!,"I extremely highly recommend the Amrit to any traveler looking for a beautiful, affordable and safe place to stay in Bali! The Amrit is a safe and secluded haven surrounded by the local culture of Bali. The breakfasts are cooked fresh every morning (ask for the traditional Balinese breakfast!) A driver is available upon request to take you anywhere you wish! and it is a great place to come home to after a busy day to relax and listen to the local wildlife and water sounds on your balcony! The staff are so lovely and helpful and make sure you check out their private woodcarving gallery/ workshop!

I didn‚Äôt think it could get any better after my first trip, but wow, the new restaurant and all of the additions and upgrades to the property take it to the next level!  The restaurant is amazing, I tried almost everything on the menu during my two week stay. The dishes are super tasty and nutritious, I left feeling so satisfied and happy after every single meal. Clearly there was great effort in selecting high quality ingredients; the fruits and vegetables tasted even better than they looked- which seemed impossible!  Everything was presented so beautifully; I couldn‚Äôt help but take photos each time a drink or food dish was served!  The seating and vibe is perfect- so much attention to detail make it truly one of a kind.  Just like the menu I found unique and creative touches all around that brought comfort, joy, and inspiration.  Perfect setting for solo meal, work meeting  (great wi-fi), date night, friends group or family gathering.  The staff was super friendly and attentive, such nice people! Options for indoor or outdoor tables with incredible views of the jungle and rice fields, it‚Äôs magical any time of day!","Oh my goodness this food is so fresh and yummy. I think I've had everything on the menu! And if you have a group it can make everyone happy I had a group of 6 full of particular dietary restrictions from vegan, to carnivores and everyone loved it! And the staff is so incredibly lovely!! The cocktails are awesome (AND if you want to have an extra bit of fun order a bottle of champagne and get ""chambongs"" to drink it with ... the only place on BALI!!","From creative cocktails (and mock tails!) to  the best latte with little cookie toothpicks, to savory grilled fish wrapped in banana leaves, I could find some new every day to rave about. Excellent service and a cultural experience too. The kindest people in the world seem to serve the best food.","We were there for a Soulrocker retreat; the experience was beyond words, but I'll try :D
Food - the selection was surprising, so many different, fresh, refreshing, and delicious choices. Food and (spirited or not) drinks. Not a bad dish or drink, pleasing to the senses and I was feeding my body, mind and soul goodness (at least if felt that way:).
Service - The most politely and personably professional staff I've ever met. Everything was with purposeful intent and care. They knew and remembered my name from first meeting...so many of them, and I had a hard time doing the same for each of them. But I wanted to, because they quickly felt like friends. Gungrai, Devi, Pande, PandeB, Gegel--and so, so many others with warm smiles and attention to detail.
Atmosphere - The scenery, the people, the vibe...it all comes together in a way that just hit me at a different frequency from the life I'm used to. Everyone, from staff to fellow travelers, gave Stay Human a feeling that I wanted to be there, I wanted to be with them, and--though a little sad to leave--so grateful to share an experience with each and every one.
If you're reading reviews, it probably means you're considering a visit. Just go. Before I went, I couldn't even expect what I would see or feel--even in the interactions at Stay Human--it was so far from my 'normal' life. Just go. Trust me on this one :D","Love the food here so much! Amazing options for all tastes, everything is so fresh and delicious. The team is really friendly sweet and knowledgeable too. Don‚Äôt miss the tacos and salad bowls!"
