The rooms are extremely basic as pictured, fans in each of them.

Internet works surprisingly well. We were originally planning on heading to another tree house bungalow but the brother of the owner of this one found us and took us here.

Quite a new experience!

It is super cheap and not that hard to find. Definitely don't come here if you're afraid of heights. Toilets are separate from the room and are very basic, one squat toilet and one western with no toilet lid. I don't believe toilet paper is provided.

For the money you can probably find better located accommodation but I don't think you will find another tree house.","Really enjoyed my stay at the tree house! It was my first time ever staying in a tree house and it was a fun experience. The tree houses have an outlet and a fan as well as WiFi which is very fast in the common area. Overall a great experience. The only downside is no AC which is expected, but hard when itâ€™s always hot on Nusa Penida.","My childhood dream of sleeping in a tree house came true! We had a scooter and mosquito spray, so we didn't have the problems of getting into the city or having insect bites. If u don't have any means of transportation it's gonna be a bit difficult to get to the city I guess.
Nice cozy location, if u're searching for something special, here it is!","Lovely stay in this tree house, it was my first experience in this kind of accommodation. Very simple and rustic but very fun also. Need a scooter to get there and around. Can rent at the pier.",Booked sea view tree house but it was not really sea view(2nd photo). Location is quite far from everything in the night unless you rent a motorbike. Breakfast was just coffee and papaya fruit. If you scared of kecko i would not recommend.
