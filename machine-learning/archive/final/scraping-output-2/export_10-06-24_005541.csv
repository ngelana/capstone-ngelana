The staff is amazing, so kind and professional, and welcoming you every day with a smile. The service and (Indonesian!) food is the best. The villa is situated in a calm and beautiful part of Bali, and with its marvellous view and pool is perfect for families with (small) children as well, thanks to the fench the staff built around the pool. We really recommend a stay in Bougain Villa at Bali.",I have stayed in a lot of hotels and Airbnbs in my life and Bougan Villa is easily the best that I've experienced.  It's one of a few villas in Bali that actually looks better in real life than it does in pictures! The staff do a fantastic job of keeping the home meticulously clean.  They are also very attentive to guests' needs and an absolute joy to work with. They made our 3 week stay in Bali one of our most memorable experiences.,"We all enjoyed the haspitality by Wayan, Dita and team. The stay, food and ambiance is mesmerising.
We were all excited for this bali trip and for our stay at Bougan Villa. The simplicity, sincierity of balinese people is amazing. we would love to visit Bali & Bougan Villa again & again.","Outstanding: Location, View, Service","I have been living 3 years in Indonesia, and traveled to Bali 10 times, and so far I have not found a place like this. The facilities, the space, the garden, the pool, the food and specially the service. It is like being in a private 5 stars hotel.
Very calm place and not much to do around but not far from Ubud or Sanur."
