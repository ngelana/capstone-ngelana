The options of Georgian cuisine are amazing. All of the food is beautiful and full of flavour!!
The cakes too are delicious!!
I would definitely recommend when in Lovina","One of the most beautiful views, I never expected it.  Was a wonderful surprise.  The tempe is delicious, and I couldn‚Äôt stop ordering their teas! Almost want to drive a couple hours just to get more of that iced tea",This afternoon we ate a delicious mie goreng on your terrace. It was a pity that the chocolate eclair was too big for me to eat as dessert. The staff is very friendly. So a wonderfully successful lunch. Terima Kasih.,"Hidden Gem in Buleleng! Food is very tasty, and we can enjoy our food with the view. Definitely gonna come back for more. The place is very peaceful, I might order food and just do my work here üòå",Great restaurant with an interesting mix of Balinese and Georgian food - both delicious. And the view is breathtaking

Soul Lodge is close (like 5 minutes walk) from the biggest bhuddist temple in Bali. You will have a really pleasant and energising stay, clothes will he laundered, breakfast and any other meals you need cooked. There is a beautiful pool and you are up on a hill so you can see the coast line which you can go to in person on a short trip.  Some people might find that it's not as close to the main strip but that's a plus for me because I like some peace and its really cheap to go to where the action is anytime. This place is worth the visit ‚ú®Ô∏è and I'd say anyone looking for the perfect little getaway retreat this is perfect.",,,,

It‚Äôs a magical place; very green, quiet and peaceful. Here you can relax, unwind and come to yourself. The food is amazing; fresh and very good prepared. The rooms are clean, beautiful furnished and comfortable. I loved dipping in the cool swimming pool, strolling through the garden or just relax and read a book in one of many comfy corners this place has to offer.
The surrounding is magnificent. Lovina beach is close and by just crossing the road you will enter this rural area of rice paddies, rivers and beautiful views everywhere. The famous Buddha Temple is just 5 minutes walking distance and the hot springs are 10 minutes drive away.
I want to come back as much as I can. Excellent for A gate away, retreat, holiday.",Wow!! In the middle of nowhere this place is like heaven. If you want to get away from he hustle and bustle of Seminyak and Kuta and explore the rural untouched side of Bali this is the place to be. Staff are lovely and always helpful. All the Villas look antique with contemporary amenities and right in the midst of the forest. Would definitely visit again.,"Will definitely be staying here again! I stayed in Rumah Cantik, just amazing.  Awesome service, fantastic food, so peaceful. Communication from the get go was brilliant, Zammin the manager was very welcoming and helpful, Bagus a brilliant and safe driver always on time and Komang's food was delicious. The bed was comfy, the pool was great, very clean and tidy. I spent a week here and feel so much better for it, a truly relaxing experience. Can't wait to stay here again. Terima kasih üôèüèª","What a magical place to stay! It's so nice and quiet, aside from the standard sounds of a typical Balinese mountain village.
You have you're own little pool to cool off in between adventures and outings. With the oldest Buddhist temple in Bali less than 200 meters away, a local river for a walk or swim only 4 minutes walk away, the Holy Hot Springs a short scooter ride away.. You're never short of any little adventures to experience.. Not to mention two incredible waterfalls a short drive away, snorkeling at Menjangan Island about an hour's drive away, and the quaint little shore-side town of Lovina only a short distance away too, where you can pick from several watering holes which to enjoy the sunset over the ocean.
Banjar really is the coolest little village in Bali to experience true Balinese culture. And with the Indo Rumah Zengarden hosts Zammin, and his sister-in-law Komang, you're never far away from some awesome stories, warm smiles, and spectacular home-made Balinese cuisine thanks to Komang's cooking. (Try the Balinese Pancakes!!)
There aren't enough kind words of praise for these two wonderful people, as well as there beautiful families. Zammin is a wealth of knowledge! Having grown up in the village of Banjar, he knows the area well, with all the local stories, as well as many many connections to local businesses to help you experience the best possibles adventures.
The only sad part about staying here is when the time comes to say goodbye.","This place at strategic location, near destinations around that's must visited.
Great traditional design of artistic Balinese house, integrated in nature and beautiful view.

High score for facility and Food & Beverage.
Warm, friendly and helpful service with smiling face from the staff and owners family.

Make feel so quite, comfort and peace.
Everything is awesome.
High pointed and Recommended."
