It‚Äôs a big space surrounded by rice fields and plenty of gorgeous plants, and the air flow is amazing so we spent a few hours working and brunching.
The menu has a great lot of options to choose from, and the mee goreng is derish!! ü§§
The onion rings is a specialty and a must try!!
We also had the chicken burger and finished with the French toast, both equally tasty.
The drinks are on the sweeter side so I asked the staff if they could make me a soda, lime & mint which they were happy to(refreshing as), and we had a couple double espresso over ice to finish off.
All in all a lovely experience and look forward to coming back here for round two.","Love this hidden gem tucked away in the rice fields. The food is amazing, super fairly priced, and everyone who works there is so sweet. The gallery is full of art from very talented local art students and the gallery director is extremely nice and passionate about the student programs they run. The rice field views are hard to beat.","cute place, very delicious food and friendly staff. Perfect place for lunch! Very good coffee and great variety of drinks and meals. Highly recommended!!",Enjoyable spot out of the tourist areas. Coffee was good and service friendly. We found it very relaxing during the daytime.,"The place is very nice and cozy. A big garden with enough shade from the trees and beautifull view.
We had chickennara Rice, this was very tastefull. Good price.
Defenitly worth the ride here"

Authentic house and friendly staff made our stay comfortable and easy. Everything was clean there. I liked that the pool is half covered with a roof, so there is also a shadow in the part of the pool - for me it is important as I do not like staying long under the sun in the middle of the day. The Owner Chok and his wife were very friendly and helped us in various issues to make our stay pleasant. If anything broke or we needed any items they immediately brought it to us.
The location is also good as you are about 30 min away from Ubud and Sanur by bike.","I was visiting the sensational Kulidan kitchen and space and wanted to stay somewhere nearby for a couple of nights. Tri Datu Palace was recommended to me and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for something better. The villa I stayed in was one of two stilted timber dwellings, suspended above a swimming pool. The villas have extensive farmland views.

The village centre‚Äôs warungs, which line the main road, serve local fare at local prices. If you want a peaceful break and genuine Balinese experience, I recommend Tri Datu Palace.",Good place good view and recomend for long stayüôèüôèüôèüôè,"Lovely place üòäüôèüèª stayed just one night cuz we  had to leave, but would definitely come back.
