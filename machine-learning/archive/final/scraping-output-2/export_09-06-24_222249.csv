The staff is so welcoming and friendly, the scenery is absolutely amazing! We almost didn‚Äôt leave the hotel and just stayed and enjoyed the beautiful nature around us. The garden is also very well maintained and a nice pool is there to refresh yourself. Also our room was very big and so nicely build.
We enjoyed a very good massage as well and good food in the restaurant.
If you love quiet and nature, this is your place!","Hotel is very nice. The infinity pool was clean and monkeys come visit!
The compounds are well kept and the view of the valley is breathtaking. The restaurant however has very limited options and charges 21% tax and service on top. Activities are also overpriced so I wouldn‚Äôt book it from them.","there are several types of accommodation.
almost all have views. the ones in the front have the best views

pur cottage had a beautiful large balcony with lounge beds and minibar, inside massive and comfy bed.
the bath tube was difficult to get in and out, but then we are very mature aged travellers.
large swimming pool.
beautiful gardens.
monkeys
good food and beautiful presented breakfast which we got served in out room.
the waterfalls are a few car minutes away.
i think one needs a scooter to fully explore the environment as the roads are very narrow for a car.
but it is ok to get to the hotel by car.
it exceeded our expectations.","The resort is set as natural as the name goes. They leave about 60% of its compound to stay green. Its landscape is a combination of old Mango trees; tropical vegetation; grass, and the jungle valley down the river.

You will listen to nature the whole day, either birds (and other creatures) singing and the sound of water hitting the rocks across the valley.

They have some book collection at the lobby and gazebo, as well as some board games. You can play dart to sharpen your instinct if you want to. That afternoon, we'd rather choose to have our complimentary afternoon tea while starring at the valley. So peaceful. Our little daughter was amazed by the parade of monkeys passing by on the fences. Dragonflies took part in the background, as if playing in the playground.  Who needs a zoo if you have yours here?

Aling - Aling waterfall is only about 15 minutes walk, and central Lovina is about the same amount of time by car.

Our one  night stay was a joke that we suddenly got to pack our luggage the next morning after viewful-breakfast. We could have stayed for 2 or 3 nights to take the privileges of being so relaxed.","Very very very friendly staff and helpful!!!üòä The view it‚Äôs amazing ü§© !! I will give more then a 2 star hotel !! This is real paradise!! Amazing pool , the room (Padma Joglo) was very spacious with a big terrace, many thanks to Mrs. Prima from the reception, she upgraded our room for free!! We have booked the standard room and we got the Padma Joglo room, because was not so busy at that time.She also helped us with medication(i had stomach problems..) , also with renting a scooter, so thanks again Mrs. Prima üòäüôèüòäüôè , but all the staff was lovely and amazing!! Thanks guys, i hope we will see us again !! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôèüôèüôè‚ò∫Ô∏è
P.S : all the guest who are low rating this hotel ‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt believe them !! We went in so many places and countries and we didn‚Äôt meet something and somebody like in this place!!"

Its super comfortable. I could just stay here for hours, such a relaxing vibe. Included here are two swimming pools, I assume one of those is for kids. Okay pricing for foods and drinks, plenty of western style dishes and drinks along with local and chinese cuisines. Looks like karaoke is possible too, and usually you can request any music to be played. There's also quite a view from the swimming pool. Entrance fee is 15k per person by the way. Lots of spots for photoshoots that are very unique and cute, there are kids playground stuffs too. Excellent place for helding events like birthday or meetings.","Came on Saturday but there is no people here. It's kinda sad because the place is good. The view is great!! The service also great, the waiter is so friendly (forgot to ask his name). But the pool needs to be cleaned, the bean bags also need to be cleaned, the pizza needs to be upgraded a little bit. The ticket is rp 15k/person for local. The food's price is not so pricey for this kinda place. Just come and enjoy the view and the atmosphere. This place deserves more attention ü•∞","I ate a really nice choco oreo pancake and Belgium juice. It was really good! We had great service from Marga. Thank you so much!!
The view was also beautiful. Definitely would recommend it! Only the toilets were not so clean.","This place is definitely one of those kind that only sells view instead of taste. They are probably the only decent resto around here, since ofc not many surround the waterfall.
Very expensive as you can see from the bills.
Service is great though. They are very friendly, but food came out slow.
The place is not that clean. Old furniture many insects trap inside.
Beautiful view of the hills though,
Nasi goreng special (57k), portion big, but rice very soggy and the dish is cold. Chicken has more flour and tasteless, especially the satay hard to chew.
Hot tea for 22K almost like standard at the 5 star resto.
Kinda surprise to see the bills though.

Well this place is a decent one if you are just planning to enjoy the view and order overly price hot tea.
But if you could hold on to your hunger and don't have stomach ache problem due to haven't eaten yet, better just go down and eat somewhere else.","nice hidden place to escape, chill out seeing scenery n even monkeys, kids love to run n swim here. The food is tasty n not expensive.  Perfect place for family, the parking lot is quite large. The place is not far from the entrance ticket for waterfalls"

I wouldn't recommend or return.","If you looking for peaceful place, best sunset view from the pool this is the one!! Room are nice and simple, bathroom and shower are outside to the room with sky view :) then around you can walk 10 minutes you have amazing waterfalls, slide, jump and hiking (top) good restaurant (outside) 3 min walking. Very nice talk and sharing experiences with who make this beautiful garden and place to relax and enjoy. Thank you",Everything alright. Good value for money and  I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything more. Great view from the tartare and house. The ladies working there are very lovely. We asked them to prepare dinner one day and the chicken curry was amazing. Also they gave us a ride to the waterfall ticket office because they saw we were very tired. Well deserved 5 stars.,"This is an amazing beautiful place, we relaxed so much as a family. The waterfalls are very close. Breakfast was great. Food in the area is not expensive and tasty. They gave amazing massages. Dolphin watching is not far away. They were brilliant at helping with transfers and everything else. You will love it.","The staff at lafyu house are SO sweet and caring. When I cut my foot they give me so much medical care. On 2 occasions they loan me cash money because I couldn't find an ATM. They treat you like family, you have no worries when staying here üëç The gardens and pool area's are so beautifull, the pictures don't do justice! Especially the pool overlooking the rice fields where I had my morning coffee. My cottage was cosy and secluded with a large porch, the breakfast at my garden table was very good too. All was very comfortable and beautifull. Will definetly stay here again if I return to Bali."

Great atmosphere and fantastic friendly service. Nice and quiet with a lovely pool and scenery of the valley and waterfall to die for. Breakfast and dinner are made by the family who own and operate the villa. You are treated like one of the family and the food is delicious. Would highly recommend this accomodation to everyone,"This place is amazing!
Ayu and her Family are so nice and welcoming! We relaxed here a lot, the view was amazing from the room and terrace! the food was really tasty and its not crowdy at all! We were the only guests and felt really at home. Ayu was there and gave us a lot of Informations about what to do in the area. Aling aling and the blue lagoon is a must-do. We stayed at blue lagoon a whole day :) we would definetly come again. üòäü•∞",,
