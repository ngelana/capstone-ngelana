Although it was closed the owners were there.
Excellent accommodation with much needed AC and sea salt swimming plunge pools.
Werti and Giuseppe suggested a mangrove tour, several beaches and an underground house.
Werti and Giuseppe made fantastico hosts with freshly cooked fish and huge prawns and of course spaghetti. It all in all turned out to be a perfect trip. We will definitely be going back.
Be sure to check the tides and times from Sanur to Lembongan.",,,,
