The whole experience is beautiful, specially the natural pools and swing that offers beautiful view of ocean. Fantastic view.Absolutely with it.!",It’s a long way down to beach but once you reach the beach it’s all worth it. There’s a holy pool of fresh water as well as a regular natural pool. So you can take a dip in ocean and then clean yourself in the fresh pool.,"Amazing place, worth the trip.
I got there at 08.30 and was alone for 1 hour. Saw some monkeys on my way down and then in the beach again. Once it becames crowded they will leave.

Parking is free, so if locals come to ask money you can say no.
Entrance fee at the bottom of 10k.
Locals will say its very dangerous and try to have you pay for the taxi ride down and then up.
You can walk the distance but its gonna be around 30 min.

The first pool is bigger and deeper but the water doesn't look good so I didn't enter. The second pool, smaller, is amazing. Clear and fresh water just by the ocean. Go early and you'll have it for you for some good time. I left around 10.30 am and there were already 4 or 5 couples there. (On a thursday)

The beach is not really suitable to swim. There's thrash in the sand, rocks and stones, and the waves are very strong.

The road down is tricky, but if you go slow and be careful its very doable. I did it and I only have 2 weeks of experience on scooters. Just use your brakes and keep your feets out of the bike to support when needed (mainly when it becomes steep). It takes about 10min to get there. I honestly think the way up is worse as if you get traffic its gonna be awkard for 2 scooters side by side in some places. (Some vídeos of the road attached)

Overall its very worth for the vibe and scenario and a nice pool to chill for a bit.","The way down to the beach is extremely steep and bumpy. There are locals waiting at the start of the road to warn you and will offer round-trip transportation in exchange for a fee. Last time we went there we paid a 100k per person.
There are 2 natural pools at two levels. The first pool is bit deep and hardly everybody go there. The second one at the bottom of the stairs connects with the beach and offer an astounding view, but will be swamped with people","An absolutely stunning spot, with clean natural pools and a very quiet beach.
The ride down was indeed quite scary and not for the feint of heart. Make sure your bike has decent brakes as it is quite steep, but we managed with two people on one small scooter. However, once down, it’s a short walk to paradise."

I would probably recommend a local driver to take you there unless you have rented a dirt bike like I did. The springs where nice, with a couple of beautiful spots where to take pictures. Be careful to the waves at the beach as they can be quiet strong.","Path was rough but I saw 3 twelve year old locals (see pic) do it with ease so if you can have confidence, peace and courage then you dont have to pay the 100k and drive yourself. To get down to the water there are big stairs.","Cool and cozy pool with a beautiful view, the road is challenging and you have to be careful, go down stairs to get to the beach and pool, there are toilets and vendors.","The only option is to go down by scooter, but the path is very, very bad, steep and narrow or too dangerous. Once you're down there, you still have to walk about 15 minutes. Once you get to the bottom it's a pretty nice place. Wouldn't go there again!","Beautiful place. Unreal scenes and refreshing spring water pool.
The road there was absolutely terrifying and our scooter struggled to climb back up with 2 of us. Luckily we had paid a local to be a guide. Be sure to bring helmets and get help from locals. Road can be very dangerous."
