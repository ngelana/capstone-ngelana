If you love pork this is a good choice,"This place is a hidden gem introduced by our local driver. The spice was stronger than the usual Babi Guling places with more side dishes compared to the already commercialized places.

The meal was fantastic while the place is still traditional went there with 2 young kids and they have no problem customizing the meal for them.

They also have ayam betutu for those who wants other than pork option.","So our local driver took us here, off the beaten track, because we asked him to take us somewhere local. The food was quite interesting.
To be honest, it wasn‚Äôt that special. We were just super hungry so we ate everything.

We ordered the main dish with everything on it. I think it was basically different parts of the pig including the meat, stomach, liver and a crispy skin slice on top with a side portion of papaya (?) salad. Our meal also came with soup‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm Asian but I felt that Indonesian food in general is just ok. It‚Äôs their sauces and sambal that really stand out","Tour guide took us here to taste the Bali dish Babi Guling. What a treat. Food was great at a ridiculous low price compared to what we are used to. As this place is crowded with locals, do not expect western standards when using the restroom or in the decor. It is all about the food. And the food is good. Downside they did not have Coca Cola. What is it with Coca Cola in Bali? Most places have very limited soda choices."

Ordered the ‚ÄúMie Special 88‚Äù and was pleased by the quality of the noodles. The food was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. I highly recommend it.","Mie 88 is my favorite noodle house. This branch is the biggest and more spacious. They also have more sitting area on the back with the love birds cage if you want to relaxing while enjoying your meals. Chicken Noodle Soup, Salted Fish Fried Rice and the Fried Wonton are my favorite. Pity that this time the noodle soup was a bit tasteless, also the pickles aren't as nice as it used to be.","Location n place easy to see and they have enough parking space.

Food: they have a lot of Chinese food variety. My fav: rujak pengantin (vegetable,tofu,boiled egg n tofu with peanut sauce). And also nasi ayam, you have to ask the staff if you want this menu, because it doesn't shown on the menu, but they have it. Its like fried rice with bok choy soup on top.

Price: rujak pengantin 27k. Nasi ayam confusing price. Because they dont have the exact price on the menu. Different branch give me different price. At this branch they charge me 50k (i think too expensive), branch at sentral parkir kuta, charge me much less (similar price with nasi capcay, i think this okay).","Ordered Mie special 88. The soup was sour. The taste was ordinary. I don't know what make it special, but at least you got meat balls and pangsit."
