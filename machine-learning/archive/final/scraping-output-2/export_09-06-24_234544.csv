Tegallalang, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80561, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=11044684485213093640,OPERATIONAL,+62 878-5568-2551,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.8,129,,"The hotel is in a beautiful location, the jungle is around, there is a firefly park nearby.

The towels were dirty and stained.
The baldachin and the bed was covered in gecko poop.
There were no hooks for towels in the shower.
There were bathrobes in the room, but they were also dirty.
The villa has a nice bathroom but there isn't enough hot water to fill it.
There is no pressure in the shower, it is impossible to wash your hair.
Breakfast was very poor.
Staff doesn't understand basic things in English, I asked them to bring me water, they only understood me the next day.

And the most important thing, there was a rat in our room. It was already night when we saw her. We reported this to the staff, they said they couldn't do anything about it and couldn't give us another room, and then they just left. I tried to go home, but there are no taxis there at all, because the area is not touristic place. I didn't sleep almost the whole night because I was scared.
I understand that this is Bali and there are a lot of living creatures here and it‚Äôs not even the rat, but the indifference of the staff.","Worst experience ever. Truly unbearable.
We had to go out to purchase insect spray to kill so many insects. It was really unacceptable when it is right at the place we are sleeping at. Also, the handle for the bathtub has been broken since the start. They did not want to take responsibility and blamed it on us. They mentioned that they will fix it and twisted their words after. Also, the architecture of the toilet is just so questionable. There was a hole in between the bathtub and shower area which links to the toilet. When it was raining, it was impossible to even want to shower. Even using the toilet, there were so much water splashing onto the toilet floor making it so slippery. Lastly, the sofas and beds were filled with stains. It was so dirty, as if they did not even bother to clean at all.

Really so disappointing especially when the location is so secluded from everywhere. No ride hailing apps would go to this area especially at night unless you have a private driver. It is so inconvenient to go anywhere.

We have left the villa on the day we moved in and booked another hotel to stay. No refund was provided too.","A wonderful small villa complex on a beautiful grounds and two private villas with a private pool. Very friendly and nice staff (special thanks to Kada and Anna, who greeted us when we arrived late in the evening). We live in a private villa with our own pool because they kindly upgraded to a room category ü•∞ a private and secluded place in incredible nature! I hope we will be back here again! üôè","I recently stayed at GOVINDA Villas and unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. Despite the promising location, the overall conditions of the villa were disappointing. Upon arrival, I immediately noticed that all surfaces were dirty, the table was covered in food stains, and the bed had a huge mold stain. To make matters worse, there was no hot water available.

Attempting to address these issues, I reached out to the host multiple times, but received no response whatsoever. With no resolution in sight, I was left with no choice but to leave earlier than planned, as the conditions were simply unbearable.

Furthermore, the lack of nearby dining options made matters worse, as there was no restaurant in the vicinity. Additionally, the villa was far from any conveniences, making it inconvenient for guests without their own transportation. Even worse, online taxi services were not permitted, leaving guests at the mercy of the accommodation's overpriced transportation options.

Overall, while the location of GOVINDA Villas held promise, the poor conditions and lack of communication with the host made for an unpleasant stay. I would not recommend this accommodation to anyone seeking a comfortable and hassle-free experience.","We stayed in the villa with the private poll. The area was amazing - we had view to the jungle. Unfortunately the cleanliness of the villa wasn‚Äôt the best. It looks like the villa is not well maintained. The staff at the acommodation looked as they don‚Äôt have much experience, but still the girls who worked there were nice. Their driver was the best - very humble and professional, I really recommend him."

FIRST - the owner is super nice and is happy to great you. You will actually go through their family property to get to entrance after paying the 25k entry.
SECOND - the descent down to the river is very steep and can be wet and slippery. The steps are also loose.
THIRD - wear appropriate shoes (like hiking boots) sandals will not do, you‚Äôll regret it.

A recent flood ripped out most the bamboo bridges making this trek very challenging. It‚Äôs wet, muddy, and not well maintained. I would not advise this unless you are in good physical condition, and have the right equipment. Most railings and ropes are destroyed. During our hike my partner and I elected to turn around for safety concerns and a lot of debris still is littered throughout the base of the river valley.
Probably worth the entry fee and effort if the trail was better maintained.","Very cool but steep path into a river full of boulders and a rickety bamboo bridge. Very high slip risk, would only recommend to agile adults. We ran out of time and unfortunately didn't get the whole way. The people running it are very lovely. 25000 per person donation","An unexpected adventure, but probably only because I didn't read these reviews.

From the entrance (IDR 25K each) it is approx 800m of a steep descent down to the river, rock climbing, balancing along makeshift bamboo bridges, and some wading through shallow water. I didn't have clothes for the wading so I turned back before seeing the actual waterfall.

I'd recommend doing this in a group just in case any accident happens.","I couldn't get there. After the raining of the last weeks, there was this huge tree, that destroyed the passway. And of course the flood had brought a lot of rubbish. I wasn't brave enough to climb down all by myself. Perhaps if you are a group you could try....",A beautiful and adventurous waterfall with a magical atmosphere. Not too crowded
