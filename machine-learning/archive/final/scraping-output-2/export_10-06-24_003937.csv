We waited in line for 10 minutes. The atmosphere was different. You can also eat on the floor if there is space. You can enter the seating areas by taking off your shoes. We ordered a 3-course meal. We couldn't finish our meal because we had to get up. They made our remaining meal pakey. Their specials looked very nice. The place, the price, /performance was high.","Great place for dinner. The atmosphere was lovely. Be prepared, you will probably be sitting on cushions on the ground. Which I love but won’t be suitable to everyone. You get a semi private space to eat, so this is a great place for groups of friends or families. Off the road so you don’t feel like you are right in the hustle and bustle of everything. The food is good and so are the prices. Around 50-60k for most things from memory. A good place for cocktails as well (considering we found it a little harder to find decent ones nearby), approx 65k per drink.",Upfront.. Only 4 stars as it's not a 4.8.. Rather a 4.5.. The setting is stunning. If you're lucky then you get one of the authentic sitting areas. Otherwise there's regular tables. Food is very good. Indonesian home style.,"Delicious food, wonderful service, and fantastic atmosphere. We had one of our most enjoyable meals in Bali at Sun Sun Warung. The staff made us feel at home and they were very accommodating to my requirements as a coeliac. Price point was excellent. We ordered 6 different meals (wanted to try a little bit of many things) and 5 cocktails - all of which was less than $400K.

All in all a wonderful evening and would highly recommend!!","Great little find, tucked away in a little back street away from passing traffic. Some of the seating is very traditional Balinese on the floor with cushions, otherwise limited table seating. We sat in side which was hot as no AC or fan. But food was amazing, full of flavour - especially the satay chicken. The bebek duck (crispy) was a little dry. But overall beautiful food and great service."

I am not a vegan but enjoyed the food. I ordered dragon roll sushi and mega protein drink.

Even though the place was packed and took long to receive food & drink, staff members were lovely and friendly.

They also offer a variety of classes and events 😊","The food is definitely good (vegan and raw) and interesting, the place has its own uniqueness and crowd, but I would rather experience something more authentic with calmer vibes. It just felt a westernized version of ubud, but that is my personal opinion and taste, and you gotta go try yourself! The food is not to miss and maybe during the day it is calmer because the night we went there was some live music and it was a bit loud and crowded so couldn't soak it in.","We found this place out of nowhere, while walking in Ubud to hide from the crowded streets.
The moment you arrive, you’re welcomed with nice people and all smiles. The food is just beyond fresh, good and, expect nothing but true natural flavors. Definitely to go back to try more healing food, because my body just asks for it! :) even if you’re not a vegan but looking for a delicious fresh balanced meal, this is the peaceful place to go.","So far everything I’ve eaten at Sayuri was very tasty and the prices are similar to other vegan places in Ubud.

My only criticism would be on the seating areas. The inside of the restaurant can get very warm at times. In the outside area there is a limited seating because some customers lie down on the seats for 2+ people.

There is seating area upstairs which is more relaxing however the ‘lounger’ cushions seem that they’ve never been washed which is a must as a lot of people lie down on them. Also, there are only a few small cushions. Definitely not enough when it’s busy and you want to sit comfortably.","AMAZING!!!!!!! Sayuri healing food has the whole menu plant-based. They have live bands and events almost every day. There are so many options for kids as well such as Mac and cheese,lovely smoothies and soft serve ice cream. It is a wonderful experience to come to Sayuri for breakfast,lunch and dinner. The best raw vegan place i have ever been to!"

Upstairs, an amazing spa offers the perfect way to complete your visit with a soothing massage. The staff at CLEAR are incredibly friendly and attentive, making the entire experience even more delightful. Overall, CLEAR in Ubud provides an incredible and memorable dining and wellness experience.","Tried their lunch menu. I would say the food is delicious with enough flavour. They are very generous with their vegetable. Ordered the tuna fried rice and Tom yum goong. The flavour in the soup really pack a punch. They have many other options in their menu as well.
The cafe itself has two levels. The atmosphere of the place is overall calming and chill. Their staff is very helpful and friendly. Had to take off our shoes when we came in which was different. Would recommend to come during lunch hour which is 11am onwards and get their lunch item.","Great place with good vibes and aura, especially at afternoon, but as some other reviewers had noted, the food are overall mid.

It has a dedicated motorbike parking below the establishment but you must be cautious because the entry and exit route is the same.

The staffs and service are very helpful and hospitable, but as noted above, the food aren't the best vegan-vegetarian food in Ubud or Bali in general. The food mostly lacks vital seasoning for the basic taste (lacks sweet, sour, umami, salty) and are mostly dry. The smoothies are too thick as beverages. The dessert are almost clearly frozen and not fresh, as we can taste the frost.

You can however take some pretty photos here and the atmosphere is good for laptop working.",Shoes are not allowed which is weird at first but refreshing. The food is very high quality with a lot of vegan and vegetarian options. The great thing is the multiple seating arrangement's giving it a very laid back vibe.,"My favorite restaurant in all of Bali! I’ve enjoyed delicious food here in 2017, 2022 and now it’s even better April 2024.

The atmosphere is welcoming and incredibly cool. The staircase has a beautiful message spelled out in flowers, the koi fish in the water are mesmerizing and the whole vibe feels great.

Servers are friendly and kind, I had only a short time since a driver was coming and when I informed the server she told me she could let kitchen know to speed it up and they did.

Hard to choose from the vibrant menu, I love the cold soups and their prawns and sauces that come with it are perfection. Juices and infused water are supper fresh and you just feel better after having this food.

I can’t wait to return to Bali and coming here is a must any visit 💛"

I recently stayed at Adiwana Resort Jembawan, and my experience was exceptional! From the warm welcome upon arrival to the serene, lush surroundings, everything was perfect for a relaxing getaway in Ubud.

The rooms are spacious, clean, and equipped with modern amenities. The interior design beautifully reflects Balinese culture, creating a comfortable and soothing atmosphere. The comfortable bed and scenic balcony view added to the luxurious feel.

The spa services were a highlight. The traditional Balinese massages were incredibly rejuvenating, and the professional, friendly staff ensured a top-notch experience.

The on-site restaurant served delicious, healthy, and varied meals. The breakfast options, featuring both local and international dishes, were a delightful start to each day.

The staff’s service was outstanding. They were always friendly, responsive, and eager to assist, making me feel at home throughout my stay.

Overall, Adiwana Resort Jembawan provided an unforgettable holiday with perfect service, excellent facilities, and a peaceful ambiance. I highly recommend this resort to anyone looking to relax and enjoy Ubud’s beauty. I will definitely return in the future!","Our stay at Adiwana was perfect. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by the warm and friendly staff. We were upgraded to the Adiwana Room on the third floor and had a wonderful outlook to the surrounding vegetation. The room was very comfortable and clean, and quiet. We enjoyed a daily breakfast at the Herb Library as well as daily afternoon tea in our room. It was an overall very relaxing stay.

The resort had daily activities as well which was a nice surprise including, yoga classes, movie night and a lesson on how to make a traditional offering.

Lastly, the resort is in a very convenient location. Walking distance to local warungs and restaurants, markets and even the monkey forest (if you don’t mind walking in the heat!).","One of the best stays we have ever had.
Really a jungle feeling in the heart of Ubud, just some steps away from the main attractions (Monkey forest, Ubud palace, Ubud market)
Everyone was so friendly and helpful, we stayed in a room with pool view and it was perfect. We are traveling with our 2yo daughter and it was great to find a place we can all relax and enjoy our holidays.
The breakfast was amazing with many healthy choices, also loved the afternoon complementary coffee or tea with a plate of pastries.
The spa was also top notch!
Cannot wait to come back soon!",We got upgraded to the Suite. Lovely spacious room with large balcony. The hotel is walking distance 10mins walk to Ubud center and palace. Very convenient. We had a relaxing morning yoga and spa at the hotel with extra charge.,"My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and we couldn’t have loved it more. It was a pleasant stay, very peaceful, quiet and romantic. The rooms were great and beds comfortable. The location is perfect and they offer yoga and mediation in the mornings as well as affordable spa offerings! The pools were also cooling and refreshing in the hot days. The restaurant attached - Herblibrary was also stellar. We ate there multiple times during our stay. Can’t wait to visit again!!"

It’s called pumpkin ravioli but it was not all the dough filled with pumpkin. It was thin and small in size (fine😀) but where was the pumpkin?😅😅most likely dough with an empty filling.

It would be great if Bali Buda could observe more of the quality and how's it going in the kitchen.

I'd like to order pumpkin ravioli again sooner or later to see if there are any changes or improvements.
(to make sure that is Pumpkin ravioli not just dough)😅",I had the smoothie bowl from the cafe which was so delicious. The granola was amazing and you can also purchase this granola from the store. I also had the chocolate nut bar from the display in the store. It was one of the best things I’ve ever tasted. They have a variety of other healthy sweets. The store also has a great variety of health foods and products.,"I love the vegan options and I really love how this place is driving sustainability for Bali. The grocery shop had items I had been looking for for months - high protein vegan items, vegan cream cheese, and so much more. Really enjoyed the breakfast bowl and vegan bibimbap. The birds sounds was a nice relaxing touch. The staff was very patient, kind, and accommodating. I love that they post calories and nutrition info on the website and have dishes to accommodate every lifestyle choice. Wish they had better vegan dessert options.","I was genuinely impressed with Bali Buda cafe! The freshness of the ingredients stood out, and the array of homemade and healthy dishes was unparalleled. Opting for the vegetable lasagna felt like a trip to my French grandmother's kitchen – the taste was comforting and reminiscent of family-style cooking. I’ve rarely seen such healthy dishes where the salad bowl is served with a few dressings to choose from on the side and you can add the dressing that you like yourself! The Bali Buda Bowl was full of flavours featuring mint, parsley, basil and seeds.
The quiet atmosphere added to the overall experience, and the service was top-notch. A delightful culinary escape with a homey touch!
We had the chicken pesto wrap, vegetable lasagna and Bali Buda bowl.",Delicious Rolled Oats with Coconut Milk. It is a perfect way to start the day. Friendly staff & bright atmosphere. It's a great place to do a little online work or enjoy a peaceful morning.

The menu is very small and when you think about it all the dishes are based on pretty much the same ingredients but still they manage to make every item interesting and tasty. The food is extremely flavorful and they don't skimp on spices.

The only downside is the poor service - annoyingly slow and inefficient but it seems like that's a common factor for all Balinese restaurants so just allow some time and patience (or prepare to wait for your drinks to arrive after you’re halfway through the meal 🙄) and enjoy the food 🤷‍♀️"

All in all we really enjoy coming here and will return regularly for sure!","This was our favourite place in Ubud to get lunch and dinner. Never call vegan food boring if you haven't tried something like this! Jackfruit Curry was the most delicious meal we had on Bali. We also loved the cake 🥰
We'll miss this place.","There is a big chance you’ll have one on the best meals in your life. They serve hi gf eat quality ingredients, you can find seasonal fruits and veggies, duck eggs even shilajit:) not forgetting the sourdough banana bread and the coconut cream! Amazing selection of healthy foods and creative, delicious beverage. It’s everything your body and soul needs! They say they cook with love and you can definitely feel it!","Very nice place, aesthetic, nice vibes.
The food is delicious and take a little time to be cooked. So u can relax and enjoy the atmosphere there.
There is beautiful view on this temple or on the open kitchen.",We were so happy to stumble across this beautiful restaurant in Ubud during our honeymoon in June last year! The food was incredible and the staff extremely kind. It had such an amazing atmosphere and we loved how everyone took their shoes off once they entered. We keep remembering their Jamus and how nice it was to just hang out there. Hope to visit soon again!

Truly a wonderful sight. The food and the medicinal teas were incredible - they were so fresh, and delicious. We enjoyed the space, we enjoyed the food and more than that we really enjoyed the beautiful service of the staff. Highly recommend everyone to visit this beautiful restaurant!","Possibly the best vegan food i tried ever! Refined taste and presentation, just like a 3star Michelin restaurant experience! Very nice and fast service, reasonable price. Only down side is hard to find, maybe a little dificult to see from the street. A real must for any Ubud vegan visitor!","Writing this review while I’m still sitting in this cute vegan restaurant. The restaurant has a clean chic vibe. Location is not disturbed by too much traffic noise, which creates a lovely romantic atmosphere while dining, even on solo travels :) The food was exceptional. Fresh and flavourful - you really feel like you’re doing your body a favour by eating the amazing healthy options the restaurant provides. I would highly recommend!","Cute looking place, with attractive looking menu.

Unfortunately I think the food definitely did not live up to the expectations and the other reviews.

The Pumpkin soup tasted watery and very sweet (did not taste many other ingredients).
The Vegan burger was very solid, difficult to swallow almost and did not taste fresh, more like a supermarket frozen patty.
The Pinaple flower drink, tasted like water, hardly any fruits in there at all.
And all that for the price  of 185k...
Can't recommend it at all.. if you want to cure your Vegan hunger.. Would still go somewhere else.","I had a wonderful meal and experience at Wild Vegan. The staff were so friendly and attentive. I came for dinner after a relaxing yoga class, so the light ambience was perfect for a tranquil solo dinner. I loved that the menu was limited in the sense that there was not an overwhelming amount of choices to decide between. I ordered the Tepache to drink - light and refreshing. For a starter, I tried the BBQ Tofu skewer... loved it and will order again. The veggies are raw adding a nice fresh flavour to the BBQ'd tofu. For mains, I ordered the Mediterranean Pulled Pork wrap - loved the flavours (delicious hummus) and accompanying fresh, good quality salad. Very filling. Despite being stuffed, I ordered the Raw Orange Cheesecake for dessert. Was a perfect level of sweetness after the meal - although, I probably should have saved half for another time as it was rather large (that's not a complaint, haha). The dessert fridge is filled with delicious raw desserts, I will definitely be back to try the burger and some more desserts before I leave. Highly recommend."

They have a couple of tables downstairs near the kitchen and a few traditional style tables where you sit close to the ground upstairs.

The food came with generous servings and was delicious","Amazing service. Food was delicious, especially the eggplant (will come back here just for this!) and seating upstairs is a great place to people watch on the street and relax. No airconditioning upstairs and steep staircase but has fans and airflow is good next to a window.","Amazing place, the food made from such a small kitchen is amazing.
Even tho some of the food as not as what my liking, but this place is amazing.",This is one of the best vietnamese noodle soup I've had in Asia so far. Good spices and big portion guaranteed. And the soft tofu of corse :)

First, the space is recessed away from the road which is wonderful. It means that it's nice and quiet and you'll likely only hear roosters and the people above you moving furniture. Our unit included free breakfast which was fine, but gets monotonous after a number of days.

Our unit was a ground floor unit and had sliding-door style entrance to the outside, so little ants, bugs, and mosquitoes made their way in. (You are in a jungle after all) We found them on the wall, scurrying on the floor and sometimes ants on the bed.

The unit did have A/C, but even on full-power it was very quiet and could not keep up with the afternoon heat. Also, it would randomly turn off throughout the day and night so we got pretty warm. It's not the kind of A/C I enjoy.

There are a handful of stairs to navigate from the main road to the units, again a few to the restaurant, then a few more to the pool. All quite doable.

The shower had great water pressure and hot water.

Location wise it's a nice walk to the main Ubud street, and other side streets to the south. The entire area is quite touristy now and you'll find everything you could imagine quite easily within a 20 minute walk.","please avoid. we could not take a shower or even wash our hands because the water is so dirty (black color)-see video and photo attached.I wish I read the comment better. I booked it for 2 nights but we left after 1 day immediately. The room is smelly, very old woth mould. We could not sleep at all because there are 2 lizzards in the room. I can understand it is the habitat but there are ways to avoid it. The lady in the front desk and the staff are very helpful. But Avoid at any cost. There are plenty of other options.","It's paradise in the middle of all the hustle bustle of Central Ubud. Staff is super friendly and attentive. The compound is lush green and devoid of the sounds of traffic, even when it is really on one of the busy street. There are 4 floors. You enter the top floor from the road, then rooms on the 2nd floor, restaurant on the 1st and swimming pool on the ground floor. I would come back to this place next time.","This place was fine. The rooms and resort were less luxurious than we were expected but they were still clean. The food was the low point. It was extremely basic. I recommend eating off of the property, there are a lot of good spots nearby. We stayed in the ""honeymoon suite"" and expected a certain standard that wasn't met. Overall this was a fine stay for Ubud, middle of the road property.","We booked the hotel for 7 days. On the 5th day we left it, because we really were not satisfied with it. Just to name some facts: we had room 106 (room with access to the pool). There was mold on every wall in the bathroom. Unfortunately, the bathroom smelled very unpleasant and everything was clammy. All in all the room was not clean. If you value cleanliness, the hotel is a poor choice. The furniture is really old and broken. The pillowcases had stains. We drank coffee in the room. The dishes for it were not cleaned for days. It was only cleaned when we brought it to the kitchen ourselves. This was not only the case once, but again and again. The staff speaks just basic English. They do not understand words like ""available"", ""replacement"" and so on.

To note something positive: in the hotel you dont hear the street noise, because it is located a little further back. The complex itself is also very nice. But that's all I can say about it. If you are blinded by reviews here that the hotel is located in the middle of the rainforest, you have never really been to the rainforest. You have a really nice view into the densely overgrown garden. But this is not a rainforest. Ubud is a city.... Where is the rainforest supposed to come from?

Admittedly, the hotel is not the most expensive, but also not the cheapest. However, there is a lack of basics here to spend a relaxing vacation. It's a big mystery to me how all these good reviews here came about. I would never ever come back here."

Laundry service was available and was priced per clothing.

Breakfast was included in the stay and banana pancakes taste great. Take away breakfast box was offered to us when we informed the staffs that we will be leaving for tour at 7am the next day.

Overall, a comfortable and affordable stay. Will highly recommend this accommodation.","The rooms are large, very comfortable and clean with a view of the swimming pool.

It is located on a quiet street, and at the same time very well located, and you can walk easily to the main street of Ubud.

The staff is very welcoming and available.",There is a cafe on the street which is a part of cottage.  The service is good and watermelon juice was fresh but the choices are limited. There were many iced teas weren't available.,One of the best in nearby market to live in. In the deluxe service they provide big room with balcony and bathtub to enjoy. They can attach two rooms in case you require big family room. Overall very good but can be improved in basic abnemities like sleepers and bathrobes.,"If you’re looking for a decent stay in Ubud, check out this place! Sits along a relatively quiet lane, not too far from Ubud central, the service here is impeccable right from the moment you enter the compound. Highly impressed with the check-in staff and the delicious welcome drinks offered. The room is spacious - not forgetting the bathroom which comes with both shower and a nice tub!

-Near main street where shops are located 🚦

-Contact number provided on WhatsApp for any assistance 📲

-Very Cheap 🤑

-Big Beds 🛌

-I enjoyed the breakfast 🥞

-Shared kitchen available for cooking 🍳

CONS:

-No AC (Only one fan) however due to it’s location in jungle complex temperature feel much lower. 🥵

-Fungus in the rooms due to moisture 🍄‍🟫

-Shared bathrooms, hygiene wasn’t bad though 🚿👌

-Rooms only have space for one bed and nothing else there. (Some rooms have mattresses on the floor). 🛌

-Despite advertising hot water shower it wasn’t available, only cold water.🚿 🥶

-Lack of any security or CCTV. ❌📹

The stuff is not professional in regards to their duties such as availability on check-in.
Due to fungus on the walls sleep quality was devastating and smell was unpleasant (Serious Health concern).

❌If you have any allergies or respiratory problems DO NOT BOOK❌

SUMMARY:
Its very cheap and good location , however I would recommend to spend slightly more for better sleep quality and overall comfort.
You won’t regret it.

Vast of positive reviews for this hotel are from Ojek’s Homestay which is merged with Leket house however their standard is much higher therefore do not be misled by high reviews of Leket House or you’ll be vastly disappointed.",the owner canceled my booking and she gave my room to another people cause they paid alot for her without even gave any notice in advance.. the most rudest behavior i have ever seen in bali from hostel .. you do not go before you book  by online thier at all to avoided to be in same situation that i have been in.. i booked a room at morning and she canceled after 5 hours from my reservation.,"I stayed here over 2 weeks. The rooms were cosy, very affordable, the residents were friendly, the place itself has a beautiful garden, it’s peaceful. The hosts, staff are so friendly. I will be staying here again!","Rooms are big and get what you paid for.  The bed was comfortable. Yeah like few other homestay I think this one also didn't provide hand wash or body wash but they do give water, cold storage and kettle with coffee. The hosts are nice and very helpful. Our flight got delayed and we reached post midnight then also they picked our call and greeted us. They also have a pool at the back.","The rooms with air conditioner here are beautiful and very comfortable. They have some others ""the cheapest"" with the mattress on the floor and sharing bathroom which I don't recommend. For a little more you will have a beautiful room with all what you need.

The menu has lots of options with 3 different coatings and 3 different fillings and also some specials. We tried the original with mozzarella and the pizza with mozzarella and both were very good in their own way and with lots of cheese. Personally, I loved the pizza one. The price was ok $24 and $26 respectively. I just wish they were bigger because I love Corn dogs","Loved the corn dogs .
Tried all the three variants for chicken , original, potatoes and noodles all of them were delicious. The mozzarella version was also quiet good.
It's Korean based snacks and they were all good ,came here just to try a snack ended up having lunch.

The Korean noodles ,rice cake and fish cake was just okay ,not a fan of that dish in particular.

Most of the snacks were pretty good.

The drinks were also quiet good.
Was a pleasant surprise,this place.

Price was quiet fair.

Halal options available.

I am so determined to go back and order the noodles again! And maybe fried wonton next time 😋

I don't understand the bad reviews. If you like bland food, stop going to Asian places as Asian places have so much flavor in their food! Go to vegan shops and you wont have salt on your food.","So tasty!!!, the broth was thick and flavourfull. I tried the spinach noodle and it was good, chewy and well cooked. Definitely will visit again if i was in ubud. I really recomend trying the chicken noodle with tofu and bean sprouts!!","This place serves hearty, delicious and savoury noodle soup dishes at very reasonable prices. The broth is the best part, so tasty z with home made flavours. I never feel bloated after I eat here and you can tell the food is prepared with care and quality. The owners cook and serve you themselves and are friendly and kind. I usually order the chicken noodle and you can choose extra toppings like veg, egg, tofu etc. And OMG if you are a fan of Hainanese chicken rice (Singapore/Malaysian style) they serve this delectable dish on Sundays also!!!!","One of my favorite meals I had in Ubud and I still think about it. The service was great, the owners are so friendly and personable. The soup was amazing, so rich and flavourful! The small was filling but I wished I would have ordered a large to be able to enjoy more of it. The noodles were fresh and tasty. Would 100% recommend!"
