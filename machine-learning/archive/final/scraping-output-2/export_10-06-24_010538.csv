I first got a room for 4 beds and the AC wasn't cold at all. Then i asked for a change, and they don't have an idea what to do cause all of the 4 beds room are full. Then, I asked for 3 beds room + 1 extra bed. The new room's faucet wasn't working but too lazy to ask them again.
No towel, no lift, old hotel with old furniture and AC except for the 4th floor which is too tiring to go there with stairs.","Comments do not honor this hotel. Good stay while we are renovating our visa (25 min walk to imm office). Pool was perfect after profiting the day outside, room was verified to be clean even before being handed with the keys, ac operational.

We asked and staff said they would deliver to our room, but they never came. We asked again and they said all towels were being laundered. Heard another guest next to our room complained about the exact same thing. Not even mineral bottled waters were served. At night I couldn't sleep because I felt annoying itches all over my body. I turned the lamp back on and was utterly shocked to find out dozens of BEDBUGS crawling all over the bed. We immediately checked out the morning after.","I stayed here when I went to Bali, it's actually very far from the beach and not close to the Kuta area. There is a nice local roadside food stall outside. Staff is rarely around and worst of all, the bathtub was stopped up! The room is big but not in good shape, don't expect a nice hotel or one that's easy to find. My taxi driver couldn't find it and I had to walk up and down the street six times before I could. If you rent a motorbike which I finally did it made it better, I think a motorbike was 50,000IDR which is very cheap","I rarely writes about a bad things.
Just to a few say.
If you need just a bed to sleep and on low budget this the hotel for you.
Big old hotel with spacious room.
Don't aspects any good services.
I booked this hotel just because is very near to Taman Werdhi Arts Centre. I spent my whole day enjoying the 2018 Bali Arts Festival for 2 days. Room just for me to sleep."

They got indoor and outdoor seating, places is definitely on the small side but its good.

gonna come here again, i recommend this place if you're craving some legit chicken noodles.

Thank you.","Tried the chicken curry noodle & the noodle (complete big portion). Both are fantastic but I prefer the noodle. The chicken chasiew was so tasty. Just a little feedback on the potato a bit hard in the curry noodle

The Huang Tang coffee (kopi susu) is a must try!

They have indoor (aircon) and outdoor space for dine in.","So we‚Äôve tried their Bakmi Keriting, Bakmi Kari and Bihun Bebek. All of them are must try, especially the bihun bebek","A homey bakmi shop in Denpasar. Their bakmi was quite tasty, but unfortunately when I came, the noodles I got were broken and not whole long. So it was a bit uncomfortable to eat with chopsticks. But surprisingly they have a good coffee here.","Just had lunch there, the noodle is slightly thick and the soup is kind of bland even though it‚Äôs smell so rich with the chicken stock.

The flavour is good tho, you just need to add little bit of soy sauce and it‚Äôll taste nice.

Portion is just OK, not fulfilling.
Good thing water is refillable.
