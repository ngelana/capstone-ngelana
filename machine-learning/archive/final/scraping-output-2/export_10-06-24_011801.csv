Kuta Sel., Kabupaten Badung, Bali 80361, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17051521262272081572,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 4469499,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.4,956,,"Our recent stay at the property was quite disappointing. While the staff were friendly and the hot water was consistent, the overall experience left much to be desired. The location was not ideal, making it difficult to access the airport and explore the surrounding area on foot. The cleanliness of the property was subpar, which was a major drawback for us. The room and refrigerator smelt really bad of mould, and has flared health issues for both me and my partner.

We tried to move rooms but were informed the hotel was fully booked. They offered to clean the air conditioner but instead only masked the smell with a coffee treatment.

Additionally, the facilities were lacking, with limited amenities available. Overall, we did not feel that the value for money matched our expectations.

We would not recommend this property for those seeking a comfortable and convenient stay. It is seriously run down and not even worth it - stay somewhere else!","Great hotel! Amazing spot for the price. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was great. If you like smoothies, those were amazing as well. They also have a small fitness center on site which I enjoyed!","Rooms are a nice size clean and comfortable. Only complaint is the shower is over a bath and it's difficult to keep water from going onto the floor. Service at reception is very good. Service in the restaurant is very bad, especially Ayu. On arrival she hands you a menu to take to your table. After ordering and receiving food she doesn't return to the table and when I needed a napkin I had to go to the front desk to ask. I was then informed that there are napkins on the next table.","Here is our story. We booked for 1 month, payed filly and manager gave us a big discount, but with term that refund is impossible.
However, we stayed only 11 days, received cleaning service only once, and we had an urgent matter to move out.

Minuses:
- A/C has a mold on the wall
- A/C smells like public toilets: called master twice, problem was not solved
- not sure what was the bike party, but for few days we have heard crazy loud roar of the engines and horns.
- bathtub surrounded with tons of mold
- in the bathroom, somewhere under the bathtub colony of insects (not sure who they were: ants with wings)

During moving out I kindly ask to return at least something, because we have been in the hotel less than half of a month! Request was declined.
Manager suggested price per night 600000rp, even though refund has not been completed.

We didn‚Äôt have much time to argue, our bad, we didn‚Äôt pay much attention to terms and services.

From pluses:
- amazing restaurant, food is so delicious

However, I would prefer rent a villa with private pool with this money than to stay in that old place","Very big rooms, compared to that the bathroom was small. Service is slightly slow, but it's alright.  Worth the money spent. Good option for stay."

Side road parking available.","Good food, less crowded and quick delivery, run by a family, reasonable price. Located on a wide road with less traffic.","For local food experience, this is recommended. They speak English, so its easy to request for diced chilly padi. If I had to nitpick, my noodle was on the oilier side. If not, the noodle was al dente and tasty, which is to my liking. A grocer is just around the corner, which is a plus point for me","Best food in Bali! We came here 3 days in a row twice a day. Lovely owners, nice portions and local prices:)","We ate at many restaurants and warungs during our 3 week stay in Bali. Without doubt, I think it's one of the best places where you can enjoy fantastic local price at such a low price. Delicious, big size portions of anything traditional you can imagine finding in Bali. A place always packed with both locals and tourists looking to enjoy a great meal. The food was so good we stopped here 3 times during our 4 day stay in Pandawa. Totally recommend!"

Originally we only booked for three nights to explore Nusa Dua but the owners were very nice and the room was great too so we extended our stay.

The room was clean and had everything we needed and we felt very welcome here. The owner also provided us tea in the morning which was very nice and some bottles of water which were much neede in Bali heat.

The location is good but you should get a scooter.
We ended up renting one each from Sari Mulia (the owners family member's business) for reasonable price and then we travelled everywhere from Uluwatu and Padang Padang all the way to Nusa Dua and Kuta.

For nearby food, Warung Local Price was great so you will not go hungry if you do not want to cook.

The only negative consideration is the amount of dogs present in the streets and gardens around. Some were quite aggressive and one street dog had foam around its mouth.

This is definitely a place we will come back to when we are in the area.","Stayed here for a week in Dec 21-28 for our year end vacation cum honeymoon. Very helpful and patient couple. Their breakfasts are yummy, both the western and Balinese. As an Indian I loved both. Price is also reasonable for cottage stay. You need bike to go around though as it's usually hot to walk outside and beaches are minimum 2 KM away. Groceries are also around 300 metre distance","This is Wonderful place to stay in Bali and one of our favourites. We spent one week in the suite with a kitchen. Pandawa beach is within driving distance, as are shops and restaurants. And the hosts are warm and accommodating. Would not hesitate to book again. Highly Recommended","If you booked a room there you found a gem. Perfect little getaway in the south, with the nicest hosts ever. The food they prepare is delicious and the rooms are nice and clean. With a scooter or car you can reach every beach/attraction in no time.
I would definitely book there again.","Fantastic place to stay, Mulia & Made are the nicest hosts you will ever meet, lovely quiet beautiful place to stay, food is fantastic. You can rent scooters direct or have Made drive you to places. This is the nicest place I have stayed in Indonesia"

This villa has a beautiful surrounding (nature). So if you are a nature or a plant lovers, you will definitely enjoy staying in here. When you first walk in to the villa there‚Äôs a big stone that says its name ‚ÄúThe Wyn Villa‚Äù. And then if you go further in the inside, you can see several door entrance to each villa that you‚Äôre going to stay in. The door entrance is very beautifully sculptured like an entrance to a historical places, even though it is rather small.
Now after you go through that door entrance you can immediately see the private pool inside the villa beside you. On my experience, the one that I‚Äôve stayed in, it was in my left side, and on the right side you can see a mini gazebo for you to relax in. After that if you go in to the building of the villa, there‚Äôs a nice living room with a TV and a few sofa, and next to that there‚Äôs 2 large bed with a curtain on each side, so that you can close it whenever you want when you need a privacy. And not to forget, the bathroom is so large, there‚Äôs a lot of empty spaces in there.
The service of this villa is quite nice, they will prepare your breakfast in the morning and deliver it to your resident, and after we‚Äôre done they will take it all back by themselves so that you don‚Äôt have to go outside your resident. I very highly recommend this villa if you guys ever want to stay in Uluwatu Bali. This place is very zen and you guys can use the pool freely without having to share with other people that you don‚Äôt know. And lastly this place is close to a beach near that place, so if you want to go to a beach you can easily find one near it.","Absolutely beautiful villa, the private pool was to die for üëåüèª and the room was spacious and clean. The staff are SO helpful, from organising breakfast to organising taxis and all with a friendly smile. Highly recommend this villa for anyone wanting to stay in the area and is only a short taxi ride away from Kuta and the surf beaches. Five stars!","My family and I loved staying here. After a big 3 week holiday, the peaceful environment was perfect to relax and enjoy our last 5 days in Bali. Gita and employees are amazing, and strive to make your stay comfortable. Nothing is too much trouble. The area is part of the developing side of the Bukit peninsula, but we're lucky to stay within the villages. As progress goes, it won't last. Thanks again Gita and all of the fabulous staff, you've made my birthday perfect!","Located in south part of bali, Kuta.
Very good location and near to the pandawa beach. Staff is very very friendly and responsive. They provide quite good breakfast with room delivery.

We have got a 1 bedroom pool villa for Rs.2800 per night. And its a big villa. Quite spacious. Pool is neatly maintained. Its just worth more than the money they charge. They have a paid laundry service which is very cheap compared to any other place in bali.
They provided a complimentery cake on our anniversay with a flower boquet üòçüíê Felt really special with their service.","Very nice stay at the wynvilla.. villa is beautiful, private pool is cleaned, hot, and the size is perfect for two! Breakfast is really good ! We spent a wonderful time et wynvilla and would definitely like to come back! Thank you to all of the nice staff !!!!"
