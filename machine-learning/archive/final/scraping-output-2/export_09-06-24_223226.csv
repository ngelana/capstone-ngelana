ChIJvzXshDuD0S0RVnTSGxPx_yw,Pondok Wisata Grya Sari Hotel,-8.2088847,114.965623,"QXR8+C6X, Banjar, Buleleng Regency, Bali 81152, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=3242575321103496278,OPERATIONAL,+62 815-5852-0100,hotel,"hotel, lodging, restaurant, food",4.2,73,,"We cannot rate this place highly enough! From the moment we arrived down the grand concrete stairs and across the beautiful bridge over the river into reception, Ayu and her family have been the most welcoming and wonderful hosts we have had on our 6month journey around South East Asia so far.
It felt like visiting family, and we spent every evening having lovely long talks with Ayu after having the most wonderful home cooked Indonesian food in their restaurant. Ayu's husband is a brilliant cook.
The hotel is perfectly positioned next to the holy hot springs but there's no real need to visit and pay the entrance fee as you have your own free and private hot spring bath at the hotel.
The accommodation is nestled into the green jungle hillside, and in the evening the only things you hear are the crickets and the flow of the spring water, which is truly relaxing.
Ayu arranged for her husband to take us to visit the beautiful buddhist monastery (which is also walkable but it was a particularly warm day) at a very reasonable price, but they can also rent you scooters.
You can book a lovely peaceful massage right in the grounds of the hotel as well.
Nothing was too much trouble, and Ayu also kindly provided us with a kettle for the room.
This hotel is just brimming with rustic charm. It is not a 5 star resort, but instead it has the most wonderful character and we didn't want to leave!
Terima kasih banyak to Ayu and family üôè we hope to return one day!","Well hidden gem. Only 3 minutes walk from the hot springs, but you won't need to go there if you are a solitary person. The accommodation place has its own decent size pool and each villa has a plunge bath with mineral water. It is slightly cooler than the main pool complex, but it is your own! The hostess is the sweetest person in Bali, speaks good English and is a herbalist, can help you with all sorts of problem. The massage offered is decent and the food cheap and exceptional. Accommodation is a bit dated, but absolutely spotless. Well worth the $15 per night or long term stay, if required. Magic spot! I should also mention the amazing Buddhist temple Brahmavihara Arama around the corner. It is open to visitors for a small fee!","The Podok Wista Grya Sari hotel is a truly magical place. As you walk from the car park down the small stone steps, the forest unfurls in front of you. There‚Äôs a gathering of bamboo to the right and a small stone bridge leads you to reception. I feel instantly transported to a bygone era of Bali.

We had come to this location only due to its proximity to the holy Banjar Hot Springs. The walking distance to the hot springs proved most convenient as we stayed there for 4 hours, soaking, sunning, soaking and chatting with the locals and tourists alike. Our tired muscles softened and our shoulders dropped a couple of centimeters.

Back at the Podok Wista, our children are still adapting to Balinese food. So we ordered pasta and pizza for their naive palates. Despite that the dishes were quickly fashioned by local flavors and styling, the kids lapped it up. The Grya Sari specialties for adults didn‚Äôt disappoint. The lemongrass sambal that came with the grilled chicken, rice and salad was a highlight! To our surprise, the WiFi was powering and there‚Äôs even healing hot spring waters tapped directly to the bath in our room. If you want more soaking, there‚Äôs a small bathhouse on top of the hotel.

The distant call of the roosters (a common place in Bali) and the running streams of the hot springs make for a most atmospheric morning to wake up to. Our lovely host explained that this hotel was built by her husband‚Äôs father in 1996. In my morning walk, I saw that their son also works here now, as the family carefully tends to to the gardens with upmost love and care.

This is a rustic location suited for meditating, writing, reflecting, even with children in tow. It‚Äôs a big call!","Very good Hotel.
Good Location.
Amazing behaviour.
And taste of Food was amazing.","If you want to experience Bali in real,this is the place to be,quiet and authentic. Owned by a wonderful friendly family welcoming with a big smile daylong. Food is good. Not a 5star hotel,but they'll do the best to help out with your needs. Feel like newborn with the energy surrounding this place.
Make sure to ask for a massage,they will arrange it for much less than you can get in a massage parlor.Afterwards jump in the holy healing,relaxing water pool within the premises which will not cost you a dime"
