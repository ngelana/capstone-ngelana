You will meet the real Bali here. Quiet place. Home fishing. The beach is relatively clean. What I recommend is to try a massage. I only took an hour, but now I know that I would definitely take more. It was a real experience. The hotel is clean and every day they refill your water or change towels, the staff is very nice and helpful. If you need a reset after hard days, this is definitely the place!","Wide Sands Beach Retreat is a gorgeous hotel. Perfect location right on the beach. Beautiful and clean rooms and facilities, and wonderful staff. We only wish we had spent our entire holiday here, four days wasn’t enough. It was a truly relaxing paradise, far from the maddening crowds of tourists that fill the rest of island. We felt like we were somewhere that was far more authentic to what Bali is. Can’t wait to return!!! Thank you so much for a fantastic time.","Very good hotel, everything was perfect! I extended my stay there because I loved this place do much. It is far from surf breaks, so you need a vehicle. It is very peaceful and quiet. The only problem it is absolutely nothing to do around there except watching sunsets, so you may get bored after a few days","Amazing place - far away from busy Bali, you can relax and enjoy sounds of the ocean, extremely high level of service and friendly staff — people who really care about you ❤️
Food is 10/10, best coffee and prawns ever
Prices are more than okay
Pool clean and beautiful
Rooms are spacious and bright
All facilities are so great
The only thing I didn’t like — dirty beach and nothing to explore nearby in case you are not interested in surfing. But the rest of it was perfect ❤️ thank you so so much","Beautiful, serene location, spacious communal area, carefully chosen traditional style construction, good materials and bed mattress, well lit rooms with garden - it's really one of the best you can get for the price."

The Staff were very kind and nice to us, and the food was really good too. Surfing in this place is also a good option because of its location. However, some rooms may not have air conditioning and be prepared with lots of bugs or insects coming into your room. The area may have rituals in the early morning which may cause disturbance when sleeping, but also be sure to have bandaids as the surfboards may burn you.","Had a great time here. Harry the lead guide and Mama the ""big boss"" at the camp, really are the heart of the place. Harry is super friendly, energetic and always watching with helpful feedback on the water. I have no idea how he sees everything he does but he really cares about you learning and having fun. All the other guides are great to but Harry really stands out.

In the ""camp"" Mama and her staff are constantly smiling and happy to help out. The food is really good and Mama is ready to answer any questions and can get things done!

The surfing was great. Each day they managed to find good conditions and a few more local spots when the point got busy. Well run and a great place to spend a week and learn more. Also a few other good restaurants within easy walking distance",I had the best time at Brown Sugar. The surf lessons were amazing and they really help improve your surfing ability. Everyone including the staff and guests always had a smile and were welcoming and friendly. Highly recommend anyone of any level to spend time at this camp. Also the food there is just amazing. Thank you for the great experience!,"Loved loved this surf camp. Would give 10 stars if I could.

Initially stayed for a few days, but ended up extending as my surfing improved massively.

Surf guiding happens twice a day so I got plenty of time in the water. Instructors also pick the best times to go based on ability so never felt out of my depth. There’s a super low instructor to student ratio (normally one instructor per two students) so never had to wait long to catch a wave. medewi itself is a perfect spot for a beginner/intermediate surfers, as waves were normally mellow so was not getting constantly wiped out on every paddle out.

Everyone you met at the surf camp, from staff to instructors is lovely. Found the team to be some of the kindest and most knowledgeable people, which made the stay really special.

My only criticism is that the rooms were quite basic. Showers and taps have no heating control, and the top of my room was open so occasionally had wildlife roaming around.

However, this wasn’t a massive issue, as all other aspects of the surf camp were perfect. Couldn’t recommend this place highly enough if your looking for a quiet escape away from the city, good surf and a few bintangs with new friends from across the world in the evening.

Looking forward to returning next time!
Harry","The Brown Sugar Surfcamp is my favorite surfcamp so far! I just wanted to stay there for one week, but in the end I ended up staying there for almost 5 weeks. I really enjoyed my time there and learned a lot while surfing. The surfguides are great, the food is good, the camp is nice and social and the location is perfect. The surfcamp is directly at the beach. I definitely recommend the camp!"

Rafy and her family are the nicest hosts, providing an awesome breakfast and a very lovely, homey feeling. We would come back to Bali just to be with them again.
It’s also a great location. Quiet, right next to the beach and the surf spots are next door. Also a lovely cafe and a great restaurant in walking distance.
The rooms are well equipped, very clean with comfortable beds where you fall asleep to the ocean sound.
This was one of the greatest experiences we had on our trip. Thank you again for this wonderful time! See you soon..","Great place to stay.

Firstly, the owners and staff are kind and accommodating. We inquired about bike rentals, so they went out to purchase bikes to rent to us that day. The location is beautiful and surrounded by grain fields, with views of the closeby mountains and ocean; the view is particularly beautiful from the rooftop. The room we're in is perfectly clean and fully equipped, with additional luxuries, like a huge smart TV with speakers and wifi that is faster than any I've had in Indonesia. Our garden view room has a full kitchen too, with a refrigerator, rice cooker, and a microwave. We even asked for a blender and they lent us one. There's a good workspace too.

The hosts have been putting on a dinner night in the skylounge every Friday with a local restaurant cooking, which has been fun. There's ping pong and pool in the skylounge.

The swimming pool area is nice, and the pool itself is large. There's also a gym with a pullup/dip bar, an exercise bike, some free weights and boxing gear.

The staff here goes out of their way to look after us, and have been able to accommodate all our living needs (laundry, transport to the grocery store, etc.) I highly recommend Medewi Manor for a comfortable, friendly stay in Bali, with beautiful views.",I have stayed at many places in Medewi over the years and I enjoyed staying here more than anywhere else. The value is excellent. The people who run it are extremely nice and make you feel like family. Not to mention the ocean views. You can check the waves from own kitchen window. The room is quality with a brand new feel to it. The views are spectacular from the common area on the third level. I stayed there with my fiancee for 2 weeks and I can't wait to stay there again. Awesome.,"Had a marvellous stay at Medewi Manor. The rooms were clean and spacious. Friendly and very helpfull staff made me feel at home. Within a few minutes walk to the beach, cafes and restaurants. Delicious food. Great surf nearby. Will definitely do it again!. Thanks Paul Sri and Yani :)","What an amazing find! Situated in a non touristy area away from the crowds we were able to relax and enjoy ourselves. The rooms are beautifully appointed, the views stunning and the manager a gem!

This place is absolutely magical. There was a lot of thought and passion put in the place to make it look and feel the way it does. If we come to Bali again it will be for Tiger and Ubud.
