What truly set this place apart was the exceptional service. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our every needâ€”from customizing the menu to suit our tastes, to organizing tours and relaxing massage sessions.

Theyâ€™ve got a great list of stuff to do around the area too. And if youâ€™re up for eating out, there are some neat cafes in Pemutaran just a short drive away.","Booked 2 rooms after bromo trip on my way to seminyak.am surprised how clean and kind service from made the one look after the customer. To be honest its just gave what European travelers needs. Price are good for this  kind of views. As long as best view,clean place, clean rooms, clean towels,clean bathroom,comfy,relax, privacy ,and worth of time, what else tourist ask more than that? This place have it all. Once again itâ€™s bali!!!this is what real bali bungalow are.love this place soo much.","What a surprise.
This resort is in the hills looking down on Menjangan. Only 4 bungalows, so quiet and private.
Google maps was our guide to get there and it was easy.
Our bungalow had good air con but we didn't need it to sleep. In fact we slept until 8.30!
Great shower and the best hot water I have experienced in a long while.
The pool is smallish (you won't do laps) but suited us fine.
The resort is still suffering from the COVID shutdown, as is all of north Bali.
So not many tourists.
As a consequence, dinner was very limited but the boys did go buy us beers.
As more people stay, they will recover and get on their feet.
My advice is certainly stay here ( the views are amazing) but pack a bit of supplies. Until they are fully functioning.
Great old-Bali stay.","Location was a bit hard to find, as it is well at the end of the area and with a bit of altitude. However that makes the views and feeling of being alone awesome.
Pool is not big but very enjoyable.
Staff was friendly although didn't speak much English...
Two things impeded perfection; breakfast was good but was missing something, at least some fruit.
Secondly their services are either lacking (no motorcycle rent/without helmets) or too expensive (transfer/shuttle)",We really enjoyed our stay. Especially the pool and the marvellous view. The dinner was also good. We really recommend the grilled fish and the fried bananas. They also organised a snorkelling tour for us which was amazing and a must. The price for the tour was great. The staff was friendly and helpful. Terima kasih!

The place is quite and really unique, the mood is like the old Bali of the 70s.
Great people really.
We did snorkeling in Menjangan island,we visited the Natural Park only there you can find black long tail monkey,we'd seen the barking deer also,very unique and rare to see in nature. Thanks to the Manager mr. Gede we'd been to a truly village Kris ceremony (don't be scary if you ear loud speakers at 4 am ahahah).

If you search for quite place with great truly Balinese people this is the place.
Thanks to Mr. Gede our Manager
Thanks to the patient Komang
Thanks to our driver Radi. You're a gentleman and a really good person.
You'd been like family for us.","A hidden gem in a village where everybody smiles. The staff was very eager to help. Stayed in Bilbo's room for one night where tiny ants swarmed on the fitted carpet but fortunately weren't interested in us or our stuff. Pool area was great, service great and a great concept. I believe most of the other rooms are cleaner. Would recommend.","Friendly staff and cool place. My brother and me loved the atmosphere over there, although unfortunately the roof leaked and our bed got wet. Nevertheless, they offered us a different room for the last night. Also, the food is also that there, but be prepared: it will take quite some time","DO NOT come here in low season. The other reviews on various sites mention a lot the good attentive and English speaking staff - they ALL get replaced with very young trainees who 1) barely speak English 2) don't maintain the place AT ALL and 3) run the place like headless chickens.
We got a bamboo house suite, Aragorn: broken TV, lots of dust, animal droppings, stains *everywhere*, low water flow, slow drain, broken bathroom door&door lock.. After one night we got a replacement (Frodo, cute room!): also dusty, broken safe, dirty, no hot water, slow drain...
And the food, oh my god. the food. We had to eat there twice (no car). Both times we got cold, barely edible food very visibly delivered from a nearby warung (their kitchen was closed. We saw both times a guy coming in with plastic bags smelling like our food, immediately before we got our food).

Unbelievable.","Very nice and welcoming people, Gede and Komang are great people, recommendable place!"

Super clean and brand new room with private bathroom on reasonable price(very cheap)
I remember the guy who owned this place at that time was very nice person.
We were invited to family event(Balinese traditional stuff) as well.
Wish all the best to the family running this place.","We really enjoyed this homestay. The owners were nice. The rooms were great, very spacious & a massive private bathroom. The restaurant & pool area is shared with ""The Hobbit House"" next door as both owners are brothers, very handy. Pool area is lovely. Restaurant food was ok. We went to a local warung for sinber ""Warung Salit"" (maybe spelt incorrectly) which is very small but amazing & cheap. Breakfast basic but must ask for vegetable in omelette otherwise its just a plain egg omelette.  The only negative, it was very noisy with roosters crowing all night, dogs barking & noisy traffic, you felt like you were near a highway.","The best place that we've ever been!! So beautiful, cozy and comfortable!! Good price and friendly, helpful staff and owner. We spent a great time here and want to Come back the next time! We love this place!! Thank you for so amazing Hotel!! ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜Š","This is a really nice place to stay. Really calm and super friendly owner, who is doing everything that you feel as compfortable as possible.","very close to West Bali National Park, a comfortable lodging."

They responded quickly!

The price is ok compared to what you'd experience. (I paid 450.000 IDR), maybe it's because the package was on sale (November 2023). You can ask them and bargain for the price.

You will get picked up at your hotel, lunch box, water, snorkeling gear and towel.

The guides are very friendly and helpful.

It's the day you'll remember.",Friendly team and very good snorkeling spots,,,
