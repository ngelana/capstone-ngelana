Feel so peace, you also can do water cleaning and blessing before enter the Pura..
Going here specially for Ratu Ayu Mas Subandar",The second palace of King Bali (Ida Sri Aji Jaya Pangus/Dalem Balingkang) after his first palace was destroyed by disasters and renewed by King Dalem Pemayun after long time leaves by old Balinese because King Jaya Pangus passed away... üôèüôèüôèüôè,"When you enter the centre of the temple area, there will be smooth breeze of wind, that will bring you gentle goosebumps, if you paying enough attention,, its feels like welcoming you, and connecting whole of you into outside.","Remember to bring a strong car. And never overload your car. Four people per car is the ideal. Driver must be competent with dangerous road. The way up is really, really steep. Only one road up, up to one car only in width, and always remember to honk your klaxon.

Other than that, the place is great. It has this very calming vibe, maybe due to its isolation. The view is very nice too. There's 5 praying spot from the most outside temple to utama mandala (innermost side). The way up to utama mandala is steep to, be careful. Pregnant woman, nursing woman, and children under 2 years old also prohibited from entering the utama mandala. Other than that it was fine.

On side note, if you choose the shorter road (the longer road is closer to the batur lake) you will pass a field full of giant rocks remnant of the last batur mountain explosion. It makes  a really great photo spot. Just mind the terrain and you are set. Just, if you choose this road get ready to wash your car. It will return with a very fetching white dust layer. You'll see when you actually get there. Good luck!",One of the temples that has a deep historical side in Bangli
