We didn't stay the all trip. We didn't get a refund as well !!!!
It was not clean, smell like cigarettes.....","This is my second time i stayed here. The first time was awesome, room is nice, comfortable and clean.

Recently i visited this place again, hoping i could find the same hotel i used to stay, but it changed so much. First, they asked me to pay additional 50k a day because i requested room with two beds (they also told us that room with two beds only available in the first floor). So we paid the additional 50k but they still gave us room with only one bed. We tried to complain but the receptionist gave no response, they finally let me move to the two beds room around 8pm.

The second room was a lil bit smelly, the light is also dirty :') the bathroom equipments are rusty (like in the pic). After two days staying in that room, the AC water was leaking caused water puddle everywhere. We finally moved to the other room.

Me and my brother expected to swim there, but we discouraged ourselves because the pool was dirty as hell, the water is green and there were so many trash under the pool floor (u guys are lucky that i lost the pool photos)

The only thing that i like staying here is bcoz there's a lot of street food outside, halal food also.

Am i coming back to this hotel? Definitely no :) +50k additional charged made this stay even more not worth it. Sorry guys, u used to be my favorite but u have disappointed me so much :)

Update: there's actually a photo to show that the pool was green, this hotel is so Lucky i dont have that dirty trash photo of the pool",the location is located in the heart of city. you only need couple of minutes to reach your destination. i chose this hotel because its location. no breakfast is OK. since you can take out your breakfast/lunch/dinner.,"Cozy place, cheap, peacefully and very recommended to stay.

The service was so friendly and helpful, too.

I ate the Klopertart Ori Mini which cost Rp 15,000 (¬£0.75). This was a vanilla tasting custard with a few sultanas and almonds, I think. Stunning taste.

The drink was one of their 3 Silky Drinks. I chose the Korean banana milk.
