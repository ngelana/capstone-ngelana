If you're staying in Bali for a while, this is a really great place to call home. Thankyou so much to the really kind gentleman and his beautiful family for having me. Cannot wait to come back and stay here again.

This isn't a 5 star hotel, but it feels more like home than any 5 star hotel you'll stay at. Great pool, nice rooms. Staying in Kerobokan was 100% the best decision I made when staying in Bali for 1 month. The motorbike rides home after wild nights or big days water rafting or hiking volcanoes made for some really cool memories.","I hate writing negative reviews but I find it to be imperative that future guests know this about Mailaku House. Service and restaurant were terrific. However, there was a stench in my room that was making me gag. Everything else at this property is far beyond acceptable for the price but the smell coming from the kitchen sink area is absolutely a deal breaker. Until that problem is resolved, I cannot honestly recommend this property.",you wont regret for sure after you book your stay here. uncle managing the property is having magic in his hands making awesome foods.  myself too booked thru online after seeing reviews. property is loacted away from tourist destinations. but if i want to stay in a quiet and calm place u can choose for sure.,"Terrible smell coming from the shower drain and bathroom was not cleaned well. I immediately noticed it when I arrived to the lady from the reception that accompanied me. The response was:
‚ÄìSorry (without any proposed solution). I asked to change rooms and the response:
‚ÄìFully booked.
The next day, I asked another lady, and again: ‚ÄìFully booked.
I then asked her to put chemical product, but nothing changed. I had to find a solution myself by placing an upside-down coffee saucer with a sachet around it to block the stench.

Apart from the smell, the cleaning in the bathroom was sloppy. The surface where they put the toothbrush kif has not been cleaned, the curtains and the shower tile grout have not been cleaned for a while.

The hotel is smaller than it looks on photo.
Too many mosquitoes, I wasn't able to enjoy the outdoor (including restaurant area)

The rooms are not soundproof. I could hear the antics of a couple in the next room as if I were with them!

The only power plug near the bed is poorly placed behind the bedside table.
The Wifi was working only one night out of my two nights, and even at the restaurant it was intermittent.

The location is not easy/quick to reach from main roads, really annoying as well.","Beautiful and clean rooms. The pool was clean. The property is full of plants, making it  pretty. The restaurant serves good food, and even bike rental is available at a good price."

Room were dirty af,bathroom were disgusting ,there was a tiny thin worms. They gave us a really thin blankets ,and the place were just loud AF. I know it's not entirely their faults that other people that stayed there couldn't keep their volume but still . Disappointed and just so not worth it.

Absolutely gorgeous natural surroundings with the well-maintained gardens and lush greenery, clean & spacious villas, warm hospitality and the beautiful yoga shala. This stay was one of the highlights of my travels and I would definitely recommend it to anyone seeking an exceptional high-quality place to stay on Bali.","First time visiting Bali and booked through Airbnb. One word.. STUNNING. The villa is absolutely stunning! It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre in the jungle. The private suites are very spacious and clean! Beautiful outdoor shower with huge bathtub. The staff are lovely and are very accommodating. Treat you like family, so friendly and always greeting you with a genuine smile. Simple and delicious breakfast options included and served every morning either to your room/dine in at the restaurant. Spa services available daily. Villa is located more in a local area but not too far from Seminyak (tourist area) Quick 15min moped üèçÔ∏è ride. Download the grab app to make your life so much easier in Bali, it‚Äôs a pick up/food delivery app (like Uber) I personally don‚Äôt mind being away from the busy tourist area because it gives you a real feel of the Bali lifestyle. Very quite and peaceful. Definitely recommend","If you want to see ants, beetles and lizards every time you enter your room, you will like this hotel","I‚Äôve been agonising about writing this review as the first thing to say is that it could easily be a 5 star resort‚Ä¶ once it‚Äôs finished.

We stayed at Umani for 10/12 days we were in Bali. The villas and grounds are well decorated in the style of what you might call Balinese minimalism. The resort is in a local area with little for tourists and feels like it‚Äôs in the middle of the jungle. We had our own private pool which was large and access to a shared pool which was even larger. The bathrooms look amazing with the typical Bali outdoor shower. The cream on the top was an amazing yoga shala in the middle of the resort.

Now unfortunately this is where things get a bit more negative. From our online booking we were expecting to be able to get food or drink all day, (it‚Äôs a resort...) however when we arrived we were told only breakfast was provided. This was made all the more frustrating by the fact that the local cafe (a very good one actually) was a good 10 minute walk. We were also expecting to be able to get yoga lessons and a spa. Neither of which were available. Sadly this is at best slightly cheeky and at worse misselling.

The place also has the impression of being unfinished with constant building work and burning of firewood. There are some details that really need further thinking about, money spent and experienced from the point of view of a guest. A few examples: The bath is amazing and absolutely huge, (you could easily fit 6 people in the bath) however the hot water tank is tiny and only fills up to mid-toe height. To get even a half-warm bath I had to run backwards and forwards to the main building to pick up hot water in tandem with the only kindly staff member working that evening. Smaller bath or bigger tank. Further issues include magnets for closing the wardrobe falling off constantly and curtains getting stuck.

The staff were absolutely amazing, and when asked were happy to go out of their way to help happily ordering taxis and doing laundry (offsite). You also got to experience nature and local culture first hand. We had bullfrogs, chickens, the local temple and the local mosque all making noise very early and keeping us up in the morning. But personally I think that was all part of the charm.

As I said at the start of my review none of this means that this won‚Äôt be amazing when the place is finished. And maybe all that I would suggest is that it‚Äôs clearer on booking sites that the place is 1. not in a tourist area and doesn‚Äôt provide food 2. is in a local area with local wildlife and therefore will be noisy 3. is still a work in progress.

Thanks to all the staff at Umani for making our stay comfortable and pleasant.","So quite , fantastic place, beautiful jungle around !
Rooms are wonderful and luxury.  You feel the bali spirit and kindness of the team"

(+)
- Friendly and helpful staff
- Spacious room for two
- Romantic terrace and pool (they clean it everyday!)
- Breakfast's taste is ok, though not really many variations
- Valued for money

(-)
- Sewage did not work really well in the bathroom
- There aren't many variation for breakfast and room service menu

Overall, so happy finding this valued for money but romantic villa!"
