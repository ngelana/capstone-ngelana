The hotel is beautifully situated in a quiet, restful paradise.
The staff were wonderful, attentive and welcoming. They also have a superb restaurant serving Balinese cuisine. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and a Balinese cocktail. ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©","This hotel resort is a peaceful retreat from busier areas of Bali. It is not a large resort. The beach is decent, but not much swimming. The surrounding area is just ok. Staying at the resort is best. Prices are reasonable. Staff are friendly. They care about and maintain the property quite well.","This hotel is so wonderful we extended our stay by a week. The staff were super welcoming, the food excellent and the grounds are gorgeous. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre in Bali and want to relax","The saddest day of my stay at this beautiful resort,  was when I had to say good bye to all my new friends. üíî  I stayed here for 7 days. Seven days of smiles,  laughter, activities, great food. All of the staff, treat you with the utmost respect and professionalism. They will go out of there way to meet all your needs and some. I left that place a better person. I now love ginger tea with  lemon grass & honey. Thank you for everything you done for me. Beautiful people. Rainy season, dry season  best place in East Bali. February 5 to 12 February. Rm 209. Best view üòç.","This is one of the best and loveliest properties in Bali. So glad we came over and stayed. You would fall in love with place at the first glimpse with the sea caressing the outside walls. As you walk on the grass, the water of the pool and the blueness of the sea merges in a singular colour.

The rooms aren‚Äôt spacious but good n clean as expected in an Alila. The food is amazing, though a bit pricey. Service is outstanding and would compliment Rati and team for the hospitality."

The place is small but the perfect place to get a nice home cooked meal whether you are looking for Indonesian Food or some western food.

We stumbled upon this place one rainy night and knew we had to come back. They have dishes like Nasi Goreng as well as Ayam Sambal Matah and even pizzas and pastas as well.

Prices are super affordable with the maximum dish only costing 30K. Everything else in the area in terms of restaurants and warnings are more expensive than that.

We ordered the food to dine in and it is also good as take away. We also order the Ayam Sambal Matah and recently ordered the Bihun Goreng and cumi crispy which were all just super yum. The cumi squid was definitely a frozen packer but it didn‚Äôt bother me.

We love supporting local business and this one is truly a gem. At night they have a huge sign that has bright lights so you will never miss it!

Highly recommend when you are traveling to East Bali and craving a nice bite and meal that is home cooked.","The food here was so good we came back! It is also very cheap, we spent less than 80 for two meals with a good amount of food. The mie goreng was the best I‚Äôve had in Indonesia!",The food is amazing here. A great little place to grab some local food and the owner and family were very nice. Great price for quality Balinese food!,"Friendly owner, yummy food also cheap price . If u want a traditional n spice food this the place üòã ,tasty ayam gebrek.","Really good service, great food quality and cheap price :)"

It has both indoors and outdoor tables with delicious food that doesn't break the your wallet. The staff is friendly and accomodating. I would recommend this to tourists seeking cultural experience in Bali, it's along the way East if you're going to explore the island.

The place in general is very clean and also visually appealing as well.

They  have free wifi, which I'm currently using because for some reason my t-mobile plan (with international coverage) isn't giving me any service.","We went there last night with Brad and Sandra from Bayshore.
Food was tasty.
Drinks cold and refreshing.
Great prices.
Staff friendly.
Very clean and tidy.
Deserve to get ahead. Well done to the family who own and run it.
Thanks Brad for taking us. Will do it again.

The waitress are friendly enaugh.","Nice foods and the price is cheap. The staff is friendly too.  I walk from my hotel (Karma royal candisa), took me 10mins.

Great prices. Great food and coffee."
