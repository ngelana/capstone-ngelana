However the music was alright, kinda boring and they play white people music lol.
Also the drive was far, it took about 40mins to get there from Canggu.",A very cool and unique place to party. It has a skatepark and tattoo parlour. The music and the crowd are fun!,"Cool place with a pool to skateboard in, drinks and t-shirts to buy. Thursdays are the busiest here (still not very busy), there's a live DJ and people are dancing and watching the skateboarders. Place is a bit far from Canggu (20mins scooter) but it is in the middle of the rice fields which is nice. The venue is not very big and closes early at midnight. When I went on Thursday around 11, it was already emptying out, but still saw two skateboarders going fast in the pool, which was pretty cool!","Fancy place to spend a weekend üòÅ Beer is 60k for a small can, which is .... okay. The pool ramp is fascinating and the overall interior and exterior design is TOP. Everything Thursday they got a party with local bands playing, such a shame that we missed that because of a traffic jam. BE AWARE OF A LOCAL TAXI DRIVERS MAFIA !!! THEY WILL TELL U THAT U CANNOT ORDER GORIDE OR BLUEBIRD BUT IT IS NOT TRUE.",Fun place to hang out and meet people. The skating is a unique touch. Very chill. Nice atmosphere.

The staff forgets about orders, brings a cup of water for 15 minutes in a restaurant with only 2 tables occupied. Also we ordered desserts, the waiter repeated and after a while said that the desserts were over, only when we asked. And so every time - honestly gave it a chance because of the beautiful view and really tasty dishes.","I can really recommend that restaurant, it has a stunning view, local concept with a focus of sustainability and on top the service is great! My waitress Novi was so caring and nice, I could really enjoy my visit in this restaurant :)","Visited their restaurant to grab lunch and an afternoon beer. What caught my attention was the disclaimer on their menu saying that they're ""not for everyone"" - I mean chill, I hadn't even ordered and I was on edge üòÑ

Overall it was good, enjoyed their Brisket Platter and tap beer, just on the pricier end.

Plenty of parking on the main road. Beautiful views of the coast to the south and mountains to the north. Go for the vibes, or for the menu's cheeky copy if you fancy.","Really beautiful place, good combination of great food n great view.
The staffs are so kind, so don't hesitate to ask them if you need something.
Definitely gonna come againüëåüíØ","Beautiful place with the ricefield view. Food served in small portion, so if you have big appetite, maybe you need to order 2 portion. They offer quite menu with other typical breakfast place, and tasted amazing!"

The service is my favourite. The female-only team made sure I felt at home right away. I learned a lot about Balinese and Indonesian culture, cuisine and traditions. The view and architecture is stunning. The villages around offer a lot for explorative spirits.

The only point that could be criticised is that one pool inflatable swimming ring might not be enough if you arrive with a partner (who also loves floats).

I‚Äôd have loved to stay longer and hope to be back.

10/10 recommended.","What an amazing property. The tree house was amazing but it wouldn't be for everyone. No air con but they did have a fan.

It is a bit of a walk to any restaurant or the beach but we knew that before booking.  Such a fantsatic experience to stay here!

A lovely breakfast was prepared for us each morning.","Coconut corner is the perfect get away! It‚Äôs beautifully located close to the ocean and is a calm spot to relax and reconnect. Lisa is an amazing host and it really feels like a home away from home. It is the place to get away from the daily Bali life, cute, calm and clean. And the breakfast is always a treat!","Stayed at Coconut Corner a few weeks ago in the Triangle Dome. The place itself is very well-designed, located in a very quiet and tranquil area. Extremely close to the beach. The open shower in the back was out of this world! The host, Lisa was very friendly and accomodating as well. It was truly a unique experience and would recommend this to anyone who ever gonna visit Bali ü§ôüèº",I loved my stay at the treehouse! Such a unique experience. So quiet & relaxing! And the pets are sooo cute as well. Come here if you are in bali :)
