We were warmly welcomed by the host who was patient to explain the different local dishes on the menu.
Probably the best dining experience we had in Bali. Fresh ingredients cooked to order.
Highly recommended!","Ikan Nyat Nyat js the best! Try it with Temu Lawak Drink. Having lunch with padi field view. Worth to try. Only 9 mins from Tirta Empul on the way back to Ubud. Pak Putu the owner is very warm welcome. Trust me, you wont be regret!","More than just a dining experience. Came here as a party of 3 during the celebration of Galungan and were graciously greeted by the entire family. We had a lovely conversation with the owner and were shown around the property to see their amazing livestock and rice patties. We were given a proper Balinese experience, as we got to try some food from the festival, pig and some banana root! It was delicious!!

Overall, a highlight of our 3 months in South East Asia and Bali, couldn't recommend it enough.","Putu and his family made us feel very welcome. There was a family celebration at the restaurant, so it was originally closed, but we were still served a very tasty lunch. Beautiful surroundings, lovely service, delicious local food and very reasonable prices. Best restaurant experience we had in Bali, thank you!","Great food, and even better view of rice paddy fields.
Putu the owner is the nicest man and will make you feel very welcomed. I had the best warung experience here.
Come by during sunset hour, you will not be disappointed!"
