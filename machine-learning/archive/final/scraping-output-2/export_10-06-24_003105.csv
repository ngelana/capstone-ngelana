The breathtaking view alone is worth the visit! Not only does this place offer organic food straight from the farm, but their light coffee boasts a delicate flavor derived from organically grown beans. Each dish is a testament to their commitment to sustainability and quality. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a serene dining experience amidst nature's beauty!","Overall was great!

Amazing food and amazing activities, we were shown the rice plantation and even got to plant some rice ourselves. Trips to waterfalls and hot springs along side playing with their adorable children were some of the highlights. Thank you to our Bali family !",100% satisfied with my stay with Herry and Dwi! Especially being on a solo trip they made me feel welcomed ! They have beautiful young children that are friendly and love to play. They take you on adventures around the village they live in showing you more to bali than you’d ever know. Amazing food and accommodating to dietary requirements. Overall it was peaceful and an experience I’ll never forget :) Thankyou Family!! Hope to visit again,"I stayed with Herry, Dwi and their family for two nights. I had the most wonderful time with them! Their family is beautiful, kind and welcoming and made us feel like family throughout our stay.

On the first day, we met the family and spent time playing uno with their younger children. Their children are so polite and kind, a real blessing. Then, Herry took us to a beautiful waterfall where we went swimming.  We also drove to the top of a rice field to watch the sunset.
On the second day we walked through their rice fields and met and spoke to the lovely ladies who were planting the rice, they were kind enough to let us have a go too! We carried on to a nearby gardens which had beautiful trees, plants and a koi fish pond. In the afternoon we went to a hot spring and bathed in the lovely warm mineral water.
We were lucky that our final day coincided with a local fishing competition, so we headed down with the children to see the festivities.
In the evenings we spent time with Herry, Dwi, and their friend Made. We had such a fun time sharing music and learning about their traditional dance.

Herry and Dwi provided us with three delicious meals a day. Herry is a professional chef so it is no surprise that the food was the best Balinese food we’ve eaten in Bali, and presented so beautifully.
They were so attentive and made sure we had everything we needed like water (they have big water tanks you can refill your bottle any time), toiletries, towels etc.

I highly recommend staying with them.",This was absolute one of the best experiences in Bali. Spending 3 night including the celebration of Nyepi. The family was wonderfull and we felt home inmediately. Worth every cent! Wish them all the best and hope more people will stay at there beautiful homestay!,"My two friends and I have had the best two nights and three days with Herry and Dwi and their lovely children, their amazing friend Made and puppies and chickens in their beautiful home!!

Amazing food and hospitality from them, Gado Gado is our new favourite dish!

They organised so many activities for us and we had so much fun seeing another side of Bali and Balinese culture that we wouldn’t have been able to see if we had not come to visit.

I can not wait to return one day:))☺️

Suksma Herry old house❤️"
