This place was a nice combination of natural waterfalls surrounded by manmade structures and pools that feed from the main waterfall. Really quiet - there were barely any people here when we arrived around 14:00. We eventually got the place to ourselves which was really pleasant. 50k entry per person and no additional fees unless you want to buy refreshments at the cafe (wouldn't recommend). Free toilets under the cafe. The road to the place is easy enough on a moped but looks narrow for a car - probably doable though!,Beautiful waterfall and the area around. Easy access. It is little pricy at 50k IDR. You get lot more for less at Aling-Aling waterfall series.,"Liked the pools, fresh water, you can refresh and relax here. Nice roads also here. 50k entrance.","A bit challenging to drive to this place due to narrow road and steep climb if you drive a car. Once parked, you need to pay the retribution to get in. Then I would recommend you to walk to the top. The view from the top is amazing."
