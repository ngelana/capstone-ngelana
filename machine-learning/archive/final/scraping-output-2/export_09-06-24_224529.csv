Well the accessibility to get there is good. I didnâ€™t pay any cent to enter this forest. I really love the ambiance. I felt like I was in a movie. The place is recommended for a photoshoot. Best visit when it is summer. But please, when you visit this place and you eat or drink something, place your trash at the bin. It is so sad seeing this forest with trashesðŸ˜©","relaxing atmosphere, can take beautiful photos","Really love the calm and peaceful atmosphere in this beautiful pine tree forest! There are some great spots to do photoshoots. You can even do some camping activities in the area. Although it is still in development, it is still fun to walk around the forest and breathe some fresh air.","Excellent. Beautiful and tranquil, quite so. The road itself is pothole-free, however take great care as it can be slippery because of so many leaves and plant matter on the road, especially during rain as well. Pay attention to your throttle control and braking techniques."
