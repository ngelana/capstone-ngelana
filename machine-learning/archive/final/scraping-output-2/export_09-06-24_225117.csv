Been here around 5.30PM and walk around the small Terrace while waiting for sunset.
There is no entrance fee required but the road driving to this terrace is pretty steep, it requires some scooter driving skills to drive in this location as the road conditions are not that good.
And there are less tourists here. During our visit, only 2 other persons here. One of the person walked the way to this terrace.
There is a restaurant nearby this terrace at the end but we were there just to have sunset scenery view so we were unsure where is the restaurant located though.",What incredible views of Munduk!! The rice terraces are breathtaking! Definitely recommend scootering around to see them or walk. Really worth it!,"Lovely rice fields, especially during sundown. Make sure to check out the house at the end of the way down the fields. Yuri offers lunch, Munduk coffee and much more than a view over the fields from his rooftop.

Some of the bad things:
- Bed sheets were dirty and stained
- After they cleaned the room they didn‚Äôt put any hand/face towels
- The sink was leaking, they fixed it but left all the water on the bathroom floor
- No shower gel: just bad shampoo and soap
- The food at their warung is not good, I also found hair in it and nobody bothered to even apologise after pointing that out
- The gave us a VERY dirty fork, clearly they don‚Äôt care about cleaning anything properly
- Overall bad and damp smell in the room
- Bad internet connection","My wife and I stayed here during our honeymoon trip around Bali. And we're enamoured with the place. The view from the rooms, the restaurant and the pool is absolutely stunning throughout the day. They have the best food in Munduk Village, and the service personnel is very kind and welcoming.

We really enjoyed our stay and would 100% recommend anyone to stay at this location as well when visiting the Munduk area.","Great Homestay, located beautiful in the mountains of Munduk. Very spacious and clean rooms with everything you need.
Staff is also extremely friendly and helpful. You can book different hiking trips at the reception with a guide from Munduk, which start at 250k up to 800k. Great for trips to lovina, the jungle and different waterfalls.

We only had one complaint because the shower always switched between warm and cold, but the staff already told us that this will be fixed very soon so no problem at all for us and the reaction was very friendly.

We would love to come back!! Wishing you all the best.","The room was very spacious. However, we spotted quite a bit of ants crawling around in the toilet. You are being given ear plugs to block out  the rooster crows in the morning. Having said that, you get to wake up to a gorgeous view and there‚Äôs a shared balcony for every 3 units.

I highly recommend this place for a meal üíõ
Oh, and the prices were great and the view excellent!","By far my favorite warung in Munduk! I was in the area for two weeks and ate there almost every day. I ate half the menu and can recommend everything. My favorite was the vegetarian nasi kampur. If you are looking to eat in a hurry, this is not the place for you. Waits may be long, but it's definitely worth it. PS: Come early for a great view of the valley!","We have been in Bali for about 2 weeks now and so far this is where we have eaten the most delicious food in Bali. We've been here 2 times now and plan to be here again (certainly, if we had stayed in Mundu longer, we would have eaten here every day). Very friendly people, delicious food and a great atmosphere - beautiful view, you can dine at sunset.","Vegetarian and vegan food is sooo good here!
Large portions. Beautiful view. Lovely hosts. What more could you ask for!?"

The owner provided excellent warm and friendly service. Very easy access to several waterfalls just by walking from the guesthouse. Owner can also take you closer to the falls if one wants to walk less hearing from other guests. We just walked directly. The place is surrounded by lush green mountains in December. A restaurant offers delicious meals and a convenience store are very near the guesthouse. We loved our stay here.","This is for sure a Munduk hidden gem.
Just the restaurant‚Äôs view in itself is an activity. We ate here several time and every meal was amazing. And they also do compost.
We got the upstairs corner‚Äôs room with this same amazing view, which was a dream. We could watch the sunset from our bed and didn‚Äôt want to leave this magical place.
Hot shower and hotel is so clean inside and out. They will do your room everyday and you have Free unlimited water refill.
Service is just amazing (they are just so nice!) and included breakfast was one by far the best we had in Indonesia in 2 weeks. So tasty and quite big portion. Lots of choice and all were very good, along with coffee and fresh juice (pineapple was the best in Indonesia)
Pretty quiet and no mosque sound. Chicken wasn‚Äôt loud enough to wake us up either.
The only cons : Internet wasn‚Äôt stable and not always very good.","One of my favorite places to stay in whole Bali. Lovely and tranquil, stunning views from the whole place, clean and well equipped, plus the owner Putu is a very nice and helpful guy. I will come back :)","As many others have already said, this is a great homestay. Stayed 4 nights over new years and I was surprised that it was mostly empty. We were given the large room with a wrap around balcony that is stand alone. The breakfast was good. The host was kind.

The only slight negative is that the location is central which means you do hear the typical neighborhood noises (dogs, roosters, motorbikes) but this would not stop me from returning.","Stayed in the room with the beautiful door on the ground floor for four nights. Beautiful property, lovely view, most courteous owner, excellent value for money, best location- all the major waterfalls are within walking distance. Host was so kind, he gave me a free ride in his car to the starting point of the hike to the waterfalls. Big beautiful room and bathroom.
The hosts went out of their way to help me with so many things. The map they gave me with the directions to waterfall was very helpful to explore the area on my own. Breakfast was customised to be vegan, got vegan pancakes, fruits and fruit juice. I had some of the best vegan lunches carefully customised by the host to suit my taste. There are also several good restaurants within a few minutes walk from Aditya that cater to vegans. You get the see the most glorious sunsets from the balcony. It‚Äôs just a sought after place for sunset watching that there are daily some tourists literally gathering around sunset time on the pavement outside Aditya to watch the sunset. Excellent Internet. Great shower and hot water. All in all, it was the  best place I stayed in during my month long trip to Indonesia; it has left a lasting impact. I would recommend go for it without any hesitation."

The toilet was even worth and smell urine. The breakfast was two toasted bread with industrial jam and some fruits.
The host were nice and we could get a taxi from them to visit around.","Best value if staying in the town center! Very clean, bright room with high quality mattress and bedding, hotshower is superb with high pressure. It's down an alley by the main road, yet very quiet and private with beautiful garden and mountain views. Breakfast is very delicious, we loved the nasi goreng! The family who runs it are very kind, down to earth and diligent, they are warm and helpful yet always gave us enough space and privacy, never tried to sell anything or stories to us while we were staying there. Definitely recommended and would love to go back there again!",Very nice homestay with quiet environment and nice view! The room is clean and the bed is very cozy. They provide big delicious breakfast for you every morning. Made (the owner) is really helpful and try his best to provide all you need. The wifi here is not very good but you can go to the restaurants nearby to use the internet if needed!,"Really nice homestay! The family are really friendly and helpful, and provide a yummy breakfast. Beautiful location with great views. Big rooms and comfy beds, good bathrooms and a nice space outside each room with tables and chairs.
*The only thing to note if you're a light sleeper (and this goes for many places around Bali) bring ear plugs - cockerels here are indiscriminate with their crowing and will do it all through the night sometimes!",Tasty breakfasts and very helpful friendly family that gave us great recommendations for activities and food.Their indonesioan breakfast is a must try . Very good and clean rooms .

Another plus is the restaurant which is part of the homestay. They are so friendly there and cook very well!! Definitely try their Munduk tea!!",Very lovely hotel / homestay run by the sweetest family.

The foods from their resto were the best in Munduk, prepared with love by the mother and the wife of the owner. And the sunset view from the rooftop was amazing. Will come back for sure!",Had a great room and exceptional food at Guru Ratna in June 2016. Made even created a healing tea for our mild flu symptoms on about 6 occasions over our 3 day stay. Gorgeous views from the restaurant towards lovina some thousands of feet below on the coast.,"Not bad if you need a quite room ask for a room in the back they have a good view of the rice padis and the wifi is better.  The staff is very friendly and helpful, they do everything they can to make you happy.  Room was clean but as they are in the jungle there are bugs in the room.  In the main area you hear all of the guest in the back you just hear the chickens and dogs.  The food wasn‚Äôt bad but also not good but its copatable with the other homestays just more expensive.","We spent two beautiful days. The standard room was clean and comfortable. There is a fantastic landscape view from the restaurant's terrace, where we tasted good traditional food. The staff was very lovable. Rudita welcomed us, he has been kind and helpful by meeting every our requests. Ropi guided us around the rice fields and waterfall, he is a friendly and interesting person. Arry is discreet and smiling, he served us with a lot of care. We strongly suggest this place","Pros: lovely owners, organised an awesome tour guide for us for hiking, good breakfast. Cons: DON'T stay in the basic shared bathroom room, it's gross! The floor was grubby, masquito net broken, and the bathroom is no bigger than two large tiles for both the bathroom and shower - and it's ew."

I agree, it was definitely one of the best and more authentic tasting I've had during our 2 week stay. The view is beautiful and food is ready quite fast. The staff was friendly. Prices are great.","Very nice food, and a lovely family! The lady did everything by her self self, it was yummy and actually came quite quickly (in other places the wait can be quite long). The view is very nice as well. And it‚Äôs a bit off the road so the traffic noice is bearable :)","Lovely place on a side alley!
