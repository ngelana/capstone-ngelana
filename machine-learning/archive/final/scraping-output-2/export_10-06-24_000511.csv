Employees are so nice, helpful and here to make your stay a dream! Thank to ‚ÄúYuman‚Äù who is take care to all my needs! 100% recommend",If you like off-the-beaten tracks and the countryside you'll love this place. The kitchen is simple but very tasty. The rooms are very clean and the garden is a gem of itself. Will be back again!,"This is an absolutely beautiful place. The pictures do not do it justice. Impeccably kept gardens with full attention to detail. Delightful 1960's style gardens and swimming pool. Very peaceful. And to top it off the food was well priced and extremely delicious. The service also came in at 10/10 It was such a wonderful surprise to  find such perfect service and a care for details not normally found in Bali. I would recommend this to anyone.  However please note, this is NOT for TV lovers as there are none. Open the window shutters and enjoy the natural beauty of nature ...flow.","Summary: amazing!
Stayed here for a week, with my bike! Amazing place with staff and management who are really helpful. The accommodations are just amazing, far above what I expected. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are fresh made and the swimming pool is without bleach!"
