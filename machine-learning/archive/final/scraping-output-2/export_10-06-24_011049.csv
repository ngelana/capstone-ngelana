So far I love my roo. Since it's on 3rd floor.
Wifi was good, but recently slower.
Now, we need to rent for car garage (start this year)
Staff always friendly","First of all, the staff or whoever it is who is in charge of receiving the guests is very unfriendly and has no manner. Don't expect a helpful smile, his attitude shows as if he doesn't need a guest. And second of all, the naming of the hotel is quite confusing. There is Pondok Raya 828 which is smaller and located in the front of Jl. Raya Pemogan road. But the hotel which I was staying was Pondok Raya II 828 which is located on Jl. Pemogan gang taman (note: you have to enter a small block in a kampung to find this hotel, and there is no sign that helps you find it. I have to continuously check the maps and the pictures of the hotel in Traveloka app to make sure I find the right hotel).
However, the hotel is affordable. There is a fridge in the room. The room is just okay, I don't really like the bed because I'm not sure with its cleanliness. It is located in a quite strategic area, (not far from the main road). If you are looking for a place not far away from Jl. Bypass Ngurah Rai, maybe this hotel can fit.","I visit my friend who came to Bali in this place
A simple but nice place to stay with affordable price. AC, refrigerator, hot water are available in the room. Wide parking area. Cooperate with airway and redoorz.","Nice place to stay, reccommend for backpacker, late booking friendly. But surrounded by crowded and environtmen is smelly.","Nice place to stay, a school is nearby, can be seen rom terrace, you can saw the student play from there"

Randomly asked the driver to stop by this when we pass by because we haven't try any Ikan Bakar in Ubud. We ordered 4 fish, 1 plate of clams, 1 plate of prawn, some kangkung, and many cups of lime(?) water. Everything was great, fresh, tasty, chili sauce with the ikan bakar is on point. Price is VERY REASONABLE. No doubt we all love it.","the soup is in big portion, taste good, but sometimes, when we are not on a lucky day, we might get a less fresh fish in the bowl",Awesome authentic Indonesian food.
