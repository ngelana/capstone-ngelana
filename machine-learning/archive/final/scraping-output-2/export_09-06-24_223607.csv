The tour guide is so good at what he's doing.
The view is sooo BEAUTIFUL 10/10.
The staff are so humble and helpful. I booked 2 ATVs at 9AM, but for some reason, I couldn't come on time. Then they asked me if they could help me reschedule or even help me with my car problem.

There are a lot of transports to take you to the view point once booked through tours kiosk. The tour guide arranges transport from your location to the base camp & jeep from base camp to sunrise point. Getting to this place takes about an hour from Ubud. And since it's sunrise make sure to wake up extra early to make it in time.
Getting from base camp to sunrise point with jeep is an adventure of its own, get a lot of neck support if need beðŸ˜…
The sunrise it itself is beautiful, the viewpoint also overlooks the huge lake and you can see small peaks of Mt. Agung from this location.
You also get a breakfast with this tour!!",Best ever and experience,,,
