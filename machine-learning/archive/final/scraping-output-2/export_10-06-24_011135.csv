The room was and felt so dirty, the sink didn’t have a tap because it was ripped off, the shower was disgusting. We opened the cupboards under the sink and it was full of mould, this triggered my asthma so bad the whole night. The walls were dirty with something which seemed like blood, I might sound like I’m exaggerating but I will put pictures.The bed sheets were so dirty we felt disgusting the whole night and the AC barely worked. There’s much more I could say but I don’t want to waste all my time in this review. I simply want to advise you not to come to this hotel.","+: warm water, working Wi-Fi, working a/c, quiet , no smells
-: room looks terrible, I had to kill a huge cockroach, half a finger size. Overall dirty, everything old, sheets with small holes, dim lights, no toilet paper or soap. Toilet door hard to close, even one night was enough to never come back here.","Bedsheet 6/10..

Most of the 5 star reviews are fake obviously as it's ""surprisingly"" the only review these accounts have done so far. Please don't go there!","Avoid this animal cruelty!
They keep the dolphins in chlorine water with a bit of salt water.
All the dolphins had their teeth removed.

Still want to go and enjoy this ""fun experience""?
Don't!","No dolphin should be in a small pool with chlorine in it.
Just don't go there... if you want to see some dolphins you have to go out in the ocean.","Frankly, at first I was really worried about going to this place after hearing the comments in the review. Thank God, my worries immediately disappeared after witnessing firsthand that all the bad comments about dolphins were a conflict of interest. Thank you Bali Dolphin for saving and caring for dolphins so well. Dolphins really enjoy playing and swimming here and there and are very enthusiastic about always interacting with humans.",I was very happy that what I experienced with the dolphin was very impressive because the dolphin was so happy playing with us. My worries about the negative reviews written by some reviewers about the dolphins immediately disappeared after witnessing firsthand how the dolphins were well cared for and happy in their place.
