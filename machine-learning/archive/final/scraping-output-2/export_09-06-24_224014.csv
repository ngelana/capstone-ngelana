The food is authentic and excellently seasoned. The chicken was extremely tender and we had a wonderful time. The owner speaks very good English and is very welcoming. Would definitely recommend!,"We enjoyed very much visiting this farm! We received home delicious food ( 3 traditional dishes ) and spend few hours talking with an owner! Our 2 years child also likes the food and asked for more corn little pancakes. It was interesting for child to play in the yard of this place and we also have excursion to the garden and tried bananas and passion fruit.
The owner is very interesting and hospitable man.","My husband and I were brought here by our driver for lunch. It was the most authentic and delicious meal we‚Äôve had in Bali! The atmosphere is beautiful and the host was very kind! His passion for his farm and work is tangible. We had the most delicious soup, rice meal, Balinese crepe and ginger tea. Highly recommend this place!!","Great experience visiting De Koffie where pak Kadek showed us around his farm and trying so many different types of fruits. If you want the real Balinese lifestyle, and authentic organic coffee, must check out this place.","Absolutely fantastic place. It is a farm with very nice people (I don't understand the comments about the dogs, they are very nice).
We did a 6 hours trekking in the forest passing through 8 waterfall. Amazing guide.
We had a wonderful lunch and a visit of the kitchen at the end of the trek. Extremely friendly people.

I strongly recommend the place ! üòé‚ò∫Ô∏è"
