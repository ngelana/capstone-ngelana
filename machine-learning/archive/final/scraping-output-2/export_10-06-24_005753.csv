There are beautiful pieces that would make for an unusual gift.
There is a large selection of bronze statuettes of decent quality. There are some very unusual ones: we saw statuettes of a platypus, cuttlefish, lobster and even a kiwi bird.
You can pay by card and via your NFC phone.","Nice and friendly staff
They showed us how the silver jewelry process takes works.
They also have a nice store where I bought some earrings for myself and my family.
Prices are fair and they said they work with locals
Overall a great experience","in this place you can see how to make jewelry from silver..from raw materials until it becomes stunning jewelry..and there are also lots of collections..the outdoor parking and shop is also very big..you need to see it if you go on holiday to Ubud, Bali..  this place is close to ubud central..about 30 minutes by vehicle..","Not an authentic market or blacksmith workshop like some tour guides market it to be.
It‚Äôs literally just a store with a bunch of accesories. If you are not into buying jewelry, then skip","Nice place, many kind of jewelery you will find over here with good price"

Negative vibes were there.

Once we entered a lady jumped and started acting roasting the beans.

I don't understand why the SUGER is added to the coffee/tea samples.

The lady was polite, yet I noticed she was in a hurry to end the tour and had no knowledge about the facility.

I ended up throwing the luwac coffee ended up for not being halal. (","See the coffee trees arabica and robusta and other spices. Here you can see for yourself the Levat cats and how this coffee is made. We tasted over 10 tea's, Bali and Levat coffee and chocolate. An explosion of tastes that you cannot find elsewhere. At the end there is a little shop where you can buy the tea/coffee/chocolate you preferred....","A great experience of coffee plantation and luwak coffee (coffee from civet) brewing. They have total 13 types of drinks for tasting all for free. 2 cocoa, 5 coffee and 6 tea. The staff are very nice.
They also take efforts to conserve civets. They breed the civets and once the civets become adults they let them free into the plantation.
A good place to visit if you are in the area or if you need to break your journey enroute south bali to ubud. We happened to stop at this place for a coffee break on our way to Ubud and it exceeded our expectation.","Amazing view with a top notch service.
You can try so many tea's and coffee's before thinking of buying them. I didn't feel pressured to buy anything in the slightest. Looking only at this a 5* experience.

But looking at the poor animals you just gotta have to think twice if you wanna support those places. They look so lifeless... One woman was sitting around, as soon as a 'guest' came she stood up and started pounding the coffee beans, like an attraction...","Very relaxing place. Dropped off by our Airbnb host/driver. Prices were great, competitively priced compared to our online search we found.

They showed a quick tour of how they process and produce the ""Luwak Kopi"". Trust me the taste is worth the trip. And they have a free taste testing as well! 5 different teas and 4 coffees. Personally enjoyed the experience (haven't tried any other ones yet) and would recommend other friends to try out next time."
