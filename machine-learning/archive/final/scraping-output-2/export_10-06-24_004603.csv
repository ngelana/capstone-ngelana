Overall a lovely place.",We had a wonderful stay at Adil Villa & Resort. Located in a strategic location and accessable by any vehicles. The staff are so accommodate and helpfull.

Came as a family of 5 with an infant and the staff was able to accommodate all our requests perfectly.
Their pool was crystal clean, and the whole property was well  maintained. Will definitely visit again.
Location: located in a quiet place away from th City centre .","This place is situated in a gorgeous rice field area with plenty of relaxing scenic views. Sitting by the pool during sunrise and sunset is splendid. The rooms are not quite like a hotel, the air conditioning unit isn‚Äôt terribly strong so the room was always a bit warm, only at night did it finally cool off a bit. There is a ceiling fan which helps some. There are bright and blinking lights from wall tech that make it harder to sleep. Food overall is not great quality or flavor, breakfast is free but very limited options. No cocktails, just beer and wine. I experienced quite a few bugs and insects in my room and the TV barely works, there‚Äôs a 5-second delay on any commands. The WiFi does work but requires constant reconnection. This is certainly a budget friendly option at around $40 USD/night, and they will nickel and dime you for everything. 5K fee for food delivery to room and 50k hotel key card replacement. Overall it was a good not great stay. Would recommend for anyone just looking to get away and relax but not for those who are uncomfortable with less modern accommodations.","Everything was perfect about this villa: kindest staff, rooms were clean and spacious, no insects at least in the suite we stayed, but the only issue was Wi-Fi. After the storm it got disconnected, and this was no one‚Äôs fault. But overall, the wi-if itself logs out if not used for few minutes, so you have to log back in. For someone who‚Äôs on holidays, it should be fine. If you need to work, go with a different option."

The chicken parmigiana and the Philly cheese steak were both very good. The Philly was cooked perfectly and they didn‚Äôt skimp on the veggies; there were onions as well as green and red bell peppers. All cooked to perfection. The bread they used was amazing (sorry I forgot the name if the bread). Light and crispy on the outside but not enough to cut your lip.

You can sit inside or outside by the garden.
Their egg benedict comes with perfect runny yolk. But the hollandaise sauce little bit sour hint. And they using white bread as a base and the veggie is spinach.","This is my favourite cafe in Bali. The atmosphere is elegant and comfortable. They play jazz music, which is severely underrated for cafes. And the food is outstanding. You should try the montblanc coffee.

Spacious, comfortable, cosy and cute, this place has it all!
And the staff was very, very accommodating, thanks y'all üòò","A truly astonishing hotel/ villa. I had quite the expectation when booking here and surely they still exceeded all my expectations.

Here is my review in general for all the review readers out there:

I booked this place aroud mid december ‚Äò23. The hotel and its surrounding was not crowded. My family and I could enjoy the peace of mind after our previous stay at a different hotel near the bustling main streets of Ubud.

The staffs were very informative and helpful. They gave us the 1BR Villa which had such a simple yet amazing view. We could see the hotel‚Äôs pool then the ricefields in close proximity (picture with the review).

The room size is standard for 2 people, but is not impossible to fit 3 (please respect the hotel policy and pay for the additional person). The room also had spacious bathroom and terrace.

Please do note that the staffs are not fully available 24hrs, please contact the hotel if you are planning to check in around midnight.

To access the main city of ubud, you could ride the public bus (route K4B at the current available route) which passes the street in front of the hotel for a cheap price. Only a 5 minute walk to the next bus stop. Easy access to/ from the main parts of the city.

My conclusion is that this place is one of the best choice for the price range. Any traveller both foreign and domestic must try to stay st this wonderful place. Hope you all have the same positive experience as me üëãüèª","Excellent service, The stuff is really caring.
Beautiful view on the rice field.
Not too far from Ubud center.
Choose the rooms with the rise View.","The pool was not maintained, and when we asked why the pool is dirty, they told us that tomorrow the pool will be clear and clean. and it was dirty because they didn't have time to maintain it due to ceremony. Of course it didn't get any better the day after.
Hopefully they will learn from this. Please be better next time.
Their villa actually has beautiful view of ricefields. But the deluxe garden doesn't have any view and was under construction, so it's a little bit dangerous for young children.","Swimming pool next to the rice field was unusable, unless you want to swim in a dirty, unmaintained pool.
The garden room (not with the ricefield view) had a construction work (they're building a new swimming pool) so this is not a great view for the garden rooms. There is also no restaurant at the hotel so you need to dine out or order somewhere else. Our bathroom had very strong smell. Decided to leave early. The only pros is, those rooms with rice field view have great view (but hope they will fix the swimming pool)."

The staff team does a very thorough job cleaning the rooms and the huge property. Inclusive of the pool, meditation area and walkways. If you need anything you can always contact the receptionist and they will do their level best to arrange it as soon as possible. There are lots of lush greenery near the property that is always maintained well. The property is next to a huge rice field. If you do choose to walk around, the locals in the field are very welcoming.

The owner, Miss Rini, has an excellent understanding of balinese culture and all the local businesses. She goes out of her way to make sure everyone has a comfortable stay at Suly. She makes great recommendations on food and activities to try while you are in Ubud.

Staying here was a life changing experience for me as I left healthier both physically and mentally. If you are looking to do something similar Suly is the place for you.","Amazing hotel. That is very exclusive to have such a huge and quiet  garden in the middle of Ubud. Absolutely recommend this place dor everyone who likes to enjoy peace and gorgeous views.

It was great to go to a museum that was about sculpture vs paintings.  And it's a great location: in the heart of the furniture/sculpture/art center and close to Ubud.

wood carving and presents selected pieces of its two great historical master carvers Ida Bagus Njana and Ida Bagus Tilem. There is also Balinese
antiques, paintings and masks on display.

Njana and Tilem, changed the face of Balinese carving. Njana took simple carving lines to a new level and Tilem introduced works using naturally distorted driftwood to express
emotion and abstract thought form.

The museum itself has an architectural style reminiscent of the bygone era of
Majapahit kingdom. The second section of the museum is a private collection of the family.  A small
Museum shop is downstairs and if you have time, stay and have lunch.  The cafe looks closed, but it is not closed.  This museum has not had its official

We've had some of the cheapest and the most delicious food in all our travels to Asia here. We ate here every day for a week straight. All the food is perfection , the portions are big, the prices are really low and the owner is a wonderful, friendly and generous Person! Big recommendation!!!","The food is nice, good for noodle spicy lover, affordable, many options with funny yet weird names, good location with wide parking area, only sometimes a little bit noisy as the preparation table close to eating table...just try them!","Nice, cute little cafe selling good foods with great price, big portion and good taste.","Great little restaurant, cheap, fresh and tastes good. Lots of locals and enough seating. Lots of parking. Recommended if you love cheap local food."

Taste was good. Cost me IDR100k for 3 packets. Value for money","A padang resto, meaning food pre prepared and choosing from pre prepared food mostly padang dishes. Another aspect that it is halal or prepared according to islamic prescriptions. I have been eating at many of this type of resto's and this one should classify as medium, not too many vegetable dishes, no fresh juices. Otherwise clean and reasonable seating","Overall worth visiting but not at night. The food can go bad yet still be there on the shelf. Also, last time I was there, the tempe was undercooked."

Top quality food, and big flavours, with lots of charcoal and wok char goodness.","Paid 130k for nothing. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!

Grilled fish sambal kemangi (basil) is super dry, but no taste of basil and I can‚Äôt see any basil leave. Taste below average. This was recommended by the staff. Like whatttt? were they just being random.. I asked them if is this the right order and they just said yes. No question asked. Why would they care.

Mussels with padang sauce taste sweet sour and just very weird, we had this dish before from Tanau and a seafood place in jimbaran. The 667 was tasted far off.

Water spinach is way too salty way way too salty.

Sambal matah is not fresh at all, no brightness, not tart whatsoever. It was very sweet draining in cooking oil! the color is really off. The amount of chilli is dominating the PALE shallot but it‚Äôs NOT SPICY! I asked the staff (who were enjoying their blasting music right in the ear) TWICE,  I asked if whether or not it‚Äôs cooked or was it mare today or yesterday. They said it‚Äôs sambal matah, sambal matah is not cooked. And it‚Äôs made just now. But taste won‚Äôt lie, would it?!

Nobody asked us how was the food regardless all the questions we asked.
Right from the start, I asked them about the menu, and they had no idea and couldn‚Äôt explain it.
Huge regret! Maybe it‚Äôs just the expectation was too high due to the review. Or did the cook was in the bad mood. Or was I supposed to order something else. This will remain a mystery because I wouldn‚Äôt coming back and make sure anyone who asks my recommendation to not come here, huge noooooo‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ total fail","Amazing atmosphere especially if you want to feel local ! The lovely young girls managing the place and the food was spot on üòç
They had wide variates of options and and especially seafood !
Highly recommended","I didn't think having a seafood in Ubud was a right choice, and I guess I was right. The service was ok, the price was reasonable, but the foods just weren't my favorite. Some of the seafoods we ordered were not fresh, the fish was not thoroughly grilled, couldn't really taste the seasoning, and the service was rather slow. If you're in hurry, I don't think this is a good option","We found this when we were suddenly craving for seafood, ""kaki lima"" or street side style. Well this totally exceeded our expectations. The seafood actually sourced from Jimbaran and cook with typical Jimbaran style and presentation. The seafood platter is perfect for two and has everything you need. The black-inked octopus is definitely the champion, but their Padang sauced oysters are a close contender. What a pleasant surprise to find this is Ubud!"
