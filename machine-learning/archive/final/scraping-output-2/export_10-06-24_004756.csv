This is outside Ubud area and nit exactly in Ubud. Rooms are nice. Breakfast is very good for Veg people.

I only had a bas experience with their Spa. Their rooms are full of mosquitoes and when you complain they tell that if you want to take it or leave it. At the same rates you get better facilities outside. The spa was very bad. I would have to take one again to relax myself.

Apart from this property is nicely maintained and the service is also good.","Amazing service, staff, stay and resort facilities! Staff are so friendly, every single one. They do their best to help and accommodate. The food in the resort is very high quality. The villa/rooms are very nice and clean. Beds are comfortable.

Note- don‚Äôt left your stuff at hotel, we forgot are 2 pairs of Nike shoes but we didn‚Äôt get it back. We called recipient couple of times.","Very nice and beautiful resort.
Friendly and professional staff.
Restaurant is a bit pricey for the area but great food.

The only thing is the King room ''Garden view'' did not match the photos that seem to be photoshoped... There is no rice terrace but a simple garden with old buildings...

Room is very spacious and romantic.","This is a very beautiful resort. Bathtub and swing with an amazing view (day plus night moonlight) and the location are my favourites‚ù§Ô∏è (only reason I gave 4 to room). Room is cozy but the bedsheets and bathroom seems to be old and unhygienic (maintenance 2.5). Another disadvantage is that the rooms aren‚Äôt soundproof. Breakfast is just okay (3). Staff is friendly. If you want to rent a good bike then be prepared for delivery service charge. Overall, a strong 3.5, worth staying if you get it at a lower price.",Wonderful experience. The bed and pillows are amazing. We did a 3 day yoga retreat with One Fit Wellness. Agie our yoga instructor is top notch. We had a massage everyday we were here. It was spectacular.
ChIJNVxVMO890i0RQySlpt93vmQ,Arte & Bamboo Tea Villas,-8.5403593,115.2356104,"F65P+V65, Jl. Raya Br. Tunon, Singakerta, Kecamatan Ubud, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80352, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=7259371451825071171,OPERATIONAL,+62 887-3194-875,,lodging,4.7,98,,"I just moved out of this place, Arte Villa, last month and totally regret it... Central local villas are so noisy with tourists play music, laundry machines running almost 24/7 and speak loudly on the phone well past midnight, not to mention full of roaches. Bamboo Villa (bamboo buildings) & Arte Villa (concrete buildings) are managed separately and have different facilities. Please clarify with the manager which ones you are interested in.

I've drawn down a few comparison with other villas for new visitors' reference:

1. There is no hidden molds behind the concrete walls. The management do not paint over molds like most Balinese landlords do. Molds create a lot of health threat over time and many visitors used to continental weather have no experience to deal with it.
2. There are staff onsite from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. which secures the villa to a great extent, and any type of emergency you can get help faster than normal Bali speed
3. Most fancy villas at similar price range have international investors overseas, not personally watching over their properties. That makes a big difference in terms of long-term maintenance.
4. This villa is quite remote, quiet and not easy access to events. Tenants are better off with scooters as markets and restaurants are not walking distance. But cleanliness and quietness is there.
5. Villa has mostly long-term expat tenants, keeping it safer from thieves. I've heard friends staying at beautiful villas raid by ex army thieves, lost millons of cash with no leads to recover.
6. Some longer-term tenants do move out because of travelling or community/ social considerations. Yet many often come back after a few months. It's a reliable choice.","Very nice bamboo houses with beautiful view to the rice fields. With good weather you can see mountains.
Also there is sauna and pool",The best sauna in Ubud! Hot enough in sauna while the cold bath takes your mind and body to other levelÔºÅ,"The Place is gorgeous, the view is stunning  360 degree ricefield and jungle view, no other houses around, 4 volcanoes sight can be seen from every room and every house, everyday yoga classes and different practices make u busy, evening cinema with hookahs, big clean swimming pool, kids and animals friendly which is a big plus, they also have a steam room and an awesome big separate kitchen but the biggest advantage is a lovely and warm community, location is great and can easily go any direction without any traffic weather it's canggu or amed or south kuta","Amazingly located villa.
Can not park car there. Come by motorbike. Also has a nice warung nearby"

To be honest the house quite difficult to get in with a car (small road) but once you get here you never want to go out. The house is amazing, fully equipped with everything you need pools, hot shower, kitchen ware& basic cooking equipment. The host is extremely helpful and there are 2 dogs at the house in which if you stay in the house they wont bother you but if you wish to play with them you can just go out to the lawn area and they will always be there and ready for you.

We spend 2 night at Haigha house and still wish we could spend more time here. Highly recommended!",Haigha House is so beautiful and comfortable. We loved spending time there and will be back again.,"Amazing design, trained eye architect.",the best,Awesome
