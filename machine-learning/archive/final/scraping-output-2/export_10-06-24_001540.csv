ChIJG-5JswQv0i0RuIuePaYZe4M,Sing Sing Angin Waterfall,-8.4484918,115.05153109999999,"H322+JJ2, Unnamed Road, Manikyang, Kec. Selemadeg, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82162, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=9474194442893036472,OPERATIONAL,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.4,269,,"Easy to find, easy to go down, not a long way to go down. Very nice waterfall. You can see it from above and from below. No waiting. No ticketing, and no drinks on site. A donation box is at the bottom.","The waterfall itself is very beautiful. Even though it has been a while since the surrounding had any maintenance.

At first we walked right past the sign of the waterfall (you can see on the picture it is quite run down)

The stairs down are a little slippery and so is the path to the waterfall itself.

Still enjoyed ourself with the beautiful view. There was absolutely no one around. The only people we see on the way were local.

No tickets needed. And again be careful where you walk, because falling is a risk. (Speaking from experience ðŸ˜‚)","It's wild and beautiful way to waterfall. You can get in touch with nature. On spot was all alone, dancing and swimming ðŸŒŠ

P.S. When you see the parking (on photo) - it's the place.","About 10 minutes walk, the entrance is not well marked but hereâ€™s a picture. Didnâ€™t get lost going in as opposite of other reviews. Waterfall is not majestic, but a pretty chill and small one. No one there, at lest when I went there was zero people",Nice waterfall but difficult to get in because of demage on the path
