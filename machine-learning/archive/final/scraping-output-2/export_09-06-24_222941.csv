We travelled from Yogyakarta to Denpasar then drove for 3.5 hours to get there, with a confirmed and paid Agoda booking in hand but were turned away. ""Never heard of you."" There was no manager on hand to speak to, just some junior staff member who ""didn't know anything"". After repeated attempts to call the absent manager in Denpasar, it turned out he ""didn't know anything"" either. Took us 3 days to contact Agoda and at time of writing they haven't managed to do anything about it (eg refund our money) either. And, of course, because we didn't actually stay there, I can't post this review on Agoda.",Booked with them and did free cancellation. They toom 308 euros without any notification and are not returning back my money. I tried texting them but they wont answer any messages. They dont answer phonecalls and they dont reply to any emails. Please return my money as it was a free cancellation. We had to postpone our Bali trip and you are not responding to any messages or phonecalls for WEEKS! It is a lot of money for me and my family and you dont have any right to keep that money since it is a free cancellation.,"A private resort out of tourist place. They just opened this year, everything is pretty new and bed really comfortable. It’s the same with pictures.

The food here extremely tasty!!!! They cooked us fresh sea fish in different way for dinner, fish soup, chicken meat, vegetables, breakfast they have western style or local fried rice/soup noodles, different fruits, they give us free fruits they grow by themselves.

5mins walk to local sea beach, it was little bit dirty and mess, but the owner arranged us to see wild dolphins with fisherman’s ship, 150k per person. It was early morning, beautiful sunrise, peaceful sea and dolphins very cute!

The manager arranged us car to go next place, it was very convenient and fair price. They can also arrange snorkeling or diving.

We enjoyed our stay here thanks to all the stuffs, they are very friendly and always ready to help.",The place was absolutely beautiful. The manager helped us negotiate some difficult transportation arrangements. The whole staff was very friendly. We were sad we only spent 1 night there. If we come back to Bali we will definitely stay at Dewantara again.,"DONT BOOK WITH THEM!!!! They are STEALING your money and then will NOT reply to any messages, email, instagram, fb messenger, booking or phonecalls. They are a huge SCAM and stole hundreds of dollars from us. When you book they need your creditcard details, just to verify. They will ripp your card and STEAL all of your money. After that they will not answer ANY messages!! I hope KARMA will get this hotel big time."

It's a beautiful and comfortable villa with a wonderful aspect.  And the team was so lovely and helpful, cooking some great food for us.","This villa is just stunning. It surpassed our expectations in every respect and provided the most lovely respite from daily life imaginable. The staff were helpful, the beds so comfortable and there were so many wonderful places to sit and watch life go by. Thoroughly recommend!!!","Stunning villa in beautifully kept grounds the villa truly has the wow factor as soon as you arrive you really won't be disappointed.
Communication before we arrived from the UK was super helpful and arranged for transportation from the airport when we landed even though it was the early hours of the morning.
We had breakfast prepared every day and the staff arranged for us to have a suckling pig prepared and bought to the villa and transformed into various unreal dishes.  Honestly the food prepared for us was amazing, local veg, beef rendang and the best noodles I've ever tasted to name a few.
The staff did grocery shopping for us each day bringing bintang and sancks in between meals.
We found a small bar about 200 yards up the beach from the villa. Perfect for a change of scenery for an hour or two.
On the whole, an amazing villa, fantastic staff and an amazing chilled out start to our Christmas holiday before we headed south of the island. Its as good if not better than the pictures.
Keep doing what your doing guys, another gem found in beautiful Bali!","Bintang poolside, superb sunsets…. This place is awesome"

It’s a bit far to get to but it’s damn worth it lovely !","I really have to say that this was one of the best vacations we ever had.
The staff is so perfect - we´re really in love. They were always available, in time, friendly and the quality was perfect. The food was excellent, all arrangements were available short term and the drivers were always on time.

The only little ""disturbance"" was the neighbors in the second week of our stay. They arrived with lot of kids and it gots very noisy during daytime but this is, of course, not under your control.","My wife and I had the privilege and pleasure of staying at this beautiful Villa from Dec 2022 until Feb 2023, and we couldn't be happier with our experience. We have both worked in the travel industry for over 40 years and have stayed in many luxurious hotels and five-star resorts, but we have never experienced a warmer and more friendly welcome than at Villa Aparna.

From the moment we arrived until the day we departed, Judda, Desi and Tisi took care of us like we were family members. Their attention to detail and dedication to making our stay comfortable and enjoyable were truly remarkable. They went above and beyond to ensure that we had everything we needed, from arranging transportation to recommending local attractions.

The Villa is located in the northern part of Bali, which was perfect for us as we wanted to escape the hustle and bustle of the main tourist areas and enjoy a more relaxed and peaceful environment. The location was simply stunning, with the direct access to the beach and the beautiful traditional architecture of the house and a garden - a true paradise.

The spacious pool was a perfect place to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings, and the lush garden, maintained by Kadek, was simply breathtaking. Nurata our night watch was also very helpful and made us feel safe and secure at any time.

However, what made our stay truly exceptional was the two ladies who are the soul of the house. They took care of us as if we were their own family and made us feel at home from day one. Their warmth, hospitality, and kindness were unmatched, and we are grateful for their service.

Overall, we came as tourists for a long-term stay and left as friends, and we hope to come back very soon. We highly recommend Villa Aparna to anyone looking for a luxurious and comfortable stay in a beautiful and peaceful environment with exceptional service. This is a five-star experience that should not be missed!",I like this villa bcause it has huge garden before the beach,

Untouched as yet by mass tourism so you get a real taste of the original day to day Balinese lifestyle.
Highly recommended for those who crave something more original and wholesome than the usual tourist traps.",We spent a week here and really can't say enough nice things about this beautiful home and staff.  Wow! The two girls were exceptional at preparing a large variety of meals and they also give great massages and facial treatments in the house.  Our driver spoke great  english and always had a great attitude.  What a place to stay!,"For people that are looking for that perfect, intangible vacation feeling with no worries but the blue sea by your side, Villa Bima Sena is your go-to pick.
From the first moment we booked, everything went flawless. We were informed that the private taxi driver (Juta)would be able to pick us up from the airport and take us to the villa. This is highly recommended, as traditional taxi's do not usually travel that far across the island. This ride will set you back around 650.000 Rupiah (~40 euros). The driver is extremely friendly, and has a great command of English. Once we arrived at the villa, we were immediately amazed by the stunning scenery that belongs to it. Peaceful buddhistic statues, and an amazing swimming pool that looks at the private beach attached to the villa make for the ultimate beach view vacation spot. The staff will cook the most delicious meals for you, which you can order the day before. They will make sure your every need is catered, as well as provide massages for a fee of 60.000 for 90 minutes (~4 euros) on a spot that overlooks the see, so you can hear and sew the sea whulst being massaged. The friendliness of all the staff and facilities absolutely blew through the expectations we had for this trip. Well done, and my compliments to the staff (which we kindly tipped, for their outstanding efforts). I would persoy recommend to ask the staff for activities, we went fishing with Juta (the driver), as well as being picked up in the morning to go see dolphins, pickup happens at the beach in front of the villa, which is also amazing.

Concluding, a 4-day stay never to forget. Thanks for everything, and until next time, Bima Sena!",We had an amazing stay at Villa Bima Sena. The villa is stunning and the staff made our trip memorable. We hope to return soon and would highly recommend,Great place to stay and alot of fun
