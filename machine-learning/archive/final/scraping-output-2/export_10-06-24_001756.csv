But I love the tempe tho! It is recommended for you to take away the foods as there are only limited seats available and might not so comfortable for dine in.","If you're looking for local food, it's one of the best. Not recommended for dine in if you're not local. üòÖ Coz it's just some kind of street food vendor.","We came here after seeing one of the video of food vlogger. We tried the usual  menu of tipat blayag. The shop it self is very modest and simple but has been opened since 50 years ago. The food it self is delicious. A mix of balinese traditional and rice cake called blayag. Dont forget to add the chicken skewer.
Not only delicius, but also cheap. This place is a must visit in amlapura city","The best local food i've had so far in Bali for this trip
A must try if you come to Karangasem
Everything are delicious","Legendary Balinese food in Amlapura,better take away and say how much you will spend on the portion (for example mix rice 20k or 30k the she will choose or you choose whatever you want)"

We‚Äôve tried different Warungs and also different fancy hotels looking for the real deal during the past week. Most of them cook their food thinking in pleasing international people so the food is normally very mild. We‚Äôve been very disappointed until now as we were looking for the real Indonesian food. So far the best food we had in Bali after a week. The place is very modest and simple but the food is extraordinary. They serve one plate  and the lady adds different little portions from different plates.,"I had the pleasure of indulging in the exquisite flavors of Belayag Karangasem cuisine at this remarkable restaurant. The moment I took my first bite, I was transported to the enchanting landscapes of Karangasem in Bali. The Belayag, a traditional dish that combines fragrant rice, tender meat, and aromatic herbs, was an absolute masterpiece.

Each element of the Belayag Karangasem dish was a harmonious symphony of flavors. The rice, cooked to perfection, carried the essence of the Balinese countryside. The meat, so succulent and rich, was marinated in a blend of spices that brought out its natural juices. The use of aromatic herbs, meticulously infused into the dish, added layers of depth and complexity that truly delighted my palate.

What truly sets this restaurant apart is their dedication to authenticity. The Belayag Karangasem was prepared using traditional methods and locally sourced ingredients, staying true to the essence of Balinese culinary heritage. The presentation was a work of art, capturing the spirit of Karangasem's vibrant culture.

For anyone seeking an unforgettable journey into the heart of Karangasem's cuisine, this restaurant is an absolute gem. The Belayag Karangasem dish is a testament to the rich culinary traditions of Bali, and a dining experience here is a true celebration of Balinese flavors and culture.",The best meal we have had in Bali! It's the first time we have ever had tipat and it did not disappoint. It was the right level of spice and it was so flavoursome. Definitely recommend on the trip back from Tirta Ganga! We had the vegetarian option which is a bonus!,"Omg, i dont expect too much when for the first time I came here. Their place in a small gang, but surprisingly the ""Blayag"" was sooooo good! Bomb taste in one plate, sweetness, saltiness, crunchiness, acidity, freshness was in there. Definitely come back! The price for Blayag just 25k.","The Good: Food was flavorful and delicious. The Bad: The location is just slightly off the main path. The Ugly: The lady who serves the food grabs all the food with her bare hand and puts it on your plate. I am not too much of a prude to immediately run out, but she's the same lady who collects cash and cleans the tables. Not certain if she washes her hands each time she grabs food for customers. I noticed this after we ate and went to pay for our food. Needless to say, I will never come back despite the great food. They need to use utensils or wear a glove when plating. Might be ok for Bali regulars who have normalized to the local bacterium and environment, but tourists could have their trip ruined because of this situation."

The menu also catered for all tastes from Local to Asian to Western. The price well it certainly did not break the bank.","Real chic, nice service, food ok, price reasonable..nice drink especialy kiwi pandan juice","We had lunch here yesterday at this new cafe in Amlapura. We enjoyed our meal and were impressed with the planning and ideas obviously taken in to consideration in opening an establishment like this.
Open plan with a rice paddy next door certainly was a nice atmosphere.
Good car parking as well and a mini mart just in case need to take home some basic necessities.

We were unsure about the place because our lack of knowledge. However, we fell in love immediately with the area. The place is serene. You can hear only the birds singing in the morning, sound of gecko, and quietness for your thoughs.

The area of Oemang Gebagan is quite large, however, since Karangasem is not popular as Nusa Dua, Kuta, Seminyak or Ubud, the place were only occupied two couples. Our room is humble with clean with modern bathroom. And for living space, we can go to dining area where the host greet and chat with us.

In the morning, the host bought us fruits, dessert from local market, breakfasts (yellow rice, savoury rice cakes). Note that the food came out for the generosity of the host.

At night, we spent 3 - 4 hours chatting with the host about Balinese philosophy and area to go around Karangasem such as Amed beach area, BugBug village, Samsara Living museum, Virgin beach, route for tracking on padi field.

The host made our experience extra ordinary because of the EXTRA attention (& love) to the guests.
