with great price, location and service. Fresh seafoodü•∫
The crispy prawn is so good melted so well in my mouth. Will definitely come back to this place, the seller is very kind and responsible, he changed the wrong menu to the correct one.

For 3 people I only paid 250K for the Amazing seafood! Def must stop.","Glad that we dropped in because they have parking space for cars (one of the few places along Jl Seririt Singaraja, the coastal road).

The ikan bakar had a terrific smoky flavour and the fish meat was grilled tenderly right.

A great place to chill during sunset, watching the fishing boats lighted up in the night.",Great fish barbecue right by the sea and you can watch a great sunset from here.,"Not the greatest seafood restaurant. Very nice sauces though. The staff was friendly and helpful. A nice view, looking over the ocean.",Good BBQ fish for a friendly price. You can watch the sun go down

Cheap but great taste,"We got recommendations by locals and it was amazing. My gf says they are the most tasty from every warungs we tried on Bali.
Expect fishs, but we ask for classic cap cay, mie goreng and nasi goreng without fish only chicken.. served with no problem. I also tried fish and was excellent.
Plus is emplacement on the beach with beautiful sunsets.",Was looking for a simple seafood place and found this hidden place. The fish soup is outstanding but super spicy. Very reasonable price.
