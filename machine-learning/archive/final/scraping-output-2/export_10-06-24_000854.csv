Although their menu could do with some serious revamping there are two great restaurants within easy walking distance along the beach (Kelapa Retreat and Puri Dajuma) and several fresh fish warungs right on the beach itself. Recommended for families who want a quiet vacation and surfers who don't mind getting on a motorbike to go to the nearest surfing spot.","We spent 7 night here in Aug 2023.  It wa a very pleasant experience.  The 2 room villa is huge for 3 of us, and was kept well.  It is with the traditional roof type.  The bathrooms were indoor with partial roof exposed to outside.

Staffs were very helpful with pleasant smile.  Carmila, Astawa were aming the staffs that make our stay pleasant. üëçüëçüëç","This resort has high standards and is very friendly and excellent facilities.
My favourite feature is the small but well equipped kitchen in the unit I rented.
The restaurant has a large selection of Western and Indonesian food which is superb and great cocktails.
The pool is large and very clean and the gardens are beautiful.
The location is not too far from the beach and tours of the area are available.
I rode a rented motorbike from Denpasar and it took about 2 hours.
Great place.","Paradise. Absolutely loving it here! Be prepared for a trip from the airport of about 2.5 hours and that you will be quite far away from Bali's tourist attractions, so making those kinds of trips would be expensive and time consuming. However, the atmosphere here is super chilled and relaxed. The beach is a 15 minute walk down a little road through jungle - black volcanic sand. The staff at the resort is super friendly and helpful - it feels like family :) there is a spa where I've had a lovely massage. The restaurant here offers delicious Indonesian and western food, and there are more restaurants and a little shop for the basics in close walking distance. Highly recommended :)","Oh we enjoyed this place very much! The room is very complete with a good bed, couch and kitchen. The swimmingpool is nice and the staff gives you the feeling that you are at home.
The food? So delicious!
We hope we can go back very soon!!"

We ordered delicious juices - delicious mint & cucumber and turmeric & honey smoothies, and veg spring rolls and filled tofu for started - all of which was very nice. Main course was fish wrapped in banana leaf parcels and sweet & sour pork - we're not sure what came in the place of the pork - it looked more like stew with beef? Whatever it was it was rather bland and chewy. The waitress spoke no English so we couldn't really communicate about what was going on. The fish was OK and the veggies were a bit bland - so main course wasn't a great success. We did get some lovely earrings from the jewelery display at the back though, and there was a supercute puppy :D","We had dinner there tonight and were really excited! The food was delicious and very fresh! Even the springrolles tasted like they were freshly made. Therefore it took a little longer until the food was prepared but that was no problem at all. The restaurant seems to be quite new and the family really did their best to make it cozy and inviting. Everything was very clean! The family was extremely friendly and were speaking good english. We were the only guests this evening, so go there if you are around! They deserve it!","Recommend! Very nice, clean and quiet place to eat. We had delicious meals and I was happy to try something else then Mia/Nasi Goreng :D. Waitress was pretty kind... I can't forget mention small cute puppy who was playing around.","My family and I eat here often when we stay in the area. A wonderful variety of dishes are offered, local and international. My favourites are the fish kibbeling and the rogan josh with paratha bread, yum. The owners are wonderful, very friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be back üòä","The staff was absolutely lovely, our waitress was so kind and helpful. The food was amazing, well made western food as well as traditional balinese cousines. Super cheap!! Definitely recommend this cozy place by the ocean!"
