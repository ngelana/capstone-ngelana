We had stinking smell in bathrooms. Got and upgrade done. 800mtrs from beach and night street.","Had an amazing two night stay. Me and 10 other friends made a 3 day trip to Nusa Penida. Of course we drove around a lot, so we only were at the hotel in the mornings and evenings but the experience was good anyway. First of all, we got welcomed very friendly. The rooms were prepared nicely and were pretty clean. The air conditioner worked well and the pool was also good. Nice, soft beds for those who like soft beds, like me :) We dad to plan our breakfast the evening before, so they could prepare it. For us that was no problem and quite convenient because we were a big group and got the food quite punctual for the time we ordered it. That was useful since we had the whole days planned out. On the second evening the eletricity went out. But that was not their fault since the government decided to shut off the big resorts since there was a power shortage. All good and well. We had fun in the pool while they brought us some nice and cold beers. After one hour the power was back, so over all it was more fun than an annoying experience. They even lit a lot of candles what resulted in a nice atmosphere :)

So summed up I would say it was a good experience and the price was totally worth it. The personal is very friendly and helpful. They took care of a spider that my friend was afraid of and even drove one of our friends, who left later, to the port.

So go there if you need an accomondation while staying on Nusa Penida!"

Phone was stolen, and that legend Yaya at the front desk straight up led me on a chase tracking the culprit for 4+ hrs despite language barrier and lack of lunch. He rounded up some friends to help with confronting the culprit at the end where I would have been scared on my own. If that isn't service I don't know what is. Seriously, give that man a pay raise. The staff bent over backwards to work with me to develop the plan of action. As a solo traveler I was so scared during the whole the situation. Had I stayed elsewhere I'd very likely be a much less fortunate man trapped with no choice but to shell out a ton to fly home and cut his asia backpacking trip short.

Great communal area outside with beanbags to chill. 5 mins away from Sampalan Harbour and the night market where you can go for good food. There isn't much to do for tourists in the area overall.

The breakfast was DELICIOUS ( the banana Toast is a must !) I unfortunately got sick one day and the stuff was super caring and worried about my well being. That day we also ordered food at the hotel and it was very enjoyable.
Thanks a lot for that great stay !","Horrible, definitely do not recommend. We've had multiple issues with this accommodation since our arrival. First, the AC was soo loud and vibrating throughout the whole room, they offered us another room, but it was the same and it was late on our first night, so we just went to sleep (not a good one). The next day they offered us to try another room (not cleaned, probably someone just checkout), which was nice of them, and the AC there was good, so we agreed on changing the room. Unfortunately afternoon we found out that the toilet in this room is not flushing. The staff tried to fix it with the plunge and it worked (but only temporarily, like for a one-time). Later that night we discovered a few huge cockroaches, my bf tried to catch some and throw them away, but there were more of them every minute because of a big hole/cranny in the backdoors. Again we turned to the staff and they provided us a ducktape to seal the door. Alright, again it was late and we were really tired, so we just went to bed (again not a good sleep). In the morning the next day, the toilet wasn't flushing anymore (like not at all, in the evening before, it was at least somehow slowly flushing). So it was the third issue during our first three days (out of 7) that we had to handle, so we said enough, talked to a lady who was present at the time, and we checkout. After that, I contacted Agoda with the refund request, which the accommodation declined (twice). I sent them a direct message, but they did not even reply. We really expected a different approach from them, because it was totally eligible request (we have photos and videos as proof). Otherwise the only good thing there was a pool. The rooms would use a better cleaning and definitely some renovation.","This place was very good value for money. The rooms are comfortable and clean, but nothing fancy. It's next to a temple, so prepare to wake to the sound of bells at about 6am.","Nice small homestay in the middle of Sampalan.

There's only 3 cottages to rent and it's all a bit outside of the central area so it's very calm and relaxing. 100% would recommend and will come back!","We stopped here for one night. It is a tranquil haven for those seeking peace and solace. Its cozy ambiance immediately wraps you in warmth and comfort, making you feel that you are very close to the nature, like you are in your childhood in the village. The serenity here is palpable, ensuring a restful stay for every guest.

Hand-made furniture adds a unique. Also I should notice very kind and friendly staff that makes stay special.

Highly recommended!",

It has air-conditioning, spacious rooms and nice private bathrooms. The service from the owners is outstanding, they will bend over backwards to help their guests. You can rent scooters from them for 75k IDR per day. If you're looking for a low cost but nice accommodation option, this is the place to go!","We stayed at Ratu Cottage for 3 nights and it was a very pleasant stay. Dewa and his family were very kind and forthcoming. They helped us with any questions we had, which made our trip so much easier and more comfortable.
The rooms are spacious and clean, the beds are a bit hard though and there was just semi-warm water. But in total the price-quality ratio is great!",Amazing place to stay. The staff were really nice. We had some problems and they solved it very quickly. They also allow bike rental for 70k per day which are much cheaper than if you rent at the port. In our last day the staff also booked us a taxi for FREE!! Breakfast were also really great and FREE! They also sell beer bintang. The place is really close to a mini market which is convenient and close to a pasar malam (night market) which had great indonesian street food and you‚Äôll only spend about 20-40k. Highly recommended üôåüèª,"This is very far from the harbor that brings in ferries from Bali. But if it's isolation you want, then Ratu is for you","Nice room for stayy! Spacious n fresh.
I like laying in the bed seeing at the ceiling.
They said will have pool soon soon~"

Thank you!","Poor customer service
I have booked 2 nights in this place in advanced, however the ferry company canceled the boat service due to weather conditions and I literally can‚Äôt get to the island because of it, I had the right to cancel the booking but wanted to do it the right way by changing the booking for 1 night instead of 2, the place canceled my request many times until I couldn‚Äôt cancel the booking for free.
I would never recommend this to any of my friends","The owner was very friendly and helpful - helped us book snorkelling tours, gave us the best places to visit and got us a taxi for when we left. The rooms were lovely for such a cheap price. Would definitely recommend!","Rooms perfect, hosts are so so nice and helpful. All the tours and the sights can be booked at the hotel. Location good, probs good to get a moped. Restaurants just around the corner. Great stay, 0 issues, 100% perfect","we got the room on the front side of the place. the room was big & clean. the bath room has soap & shampoo dispenser. we got extra bed with no extra charge. the food was great. this place is near the port, and convenience store. the only down side is there's no parking space even for motorcycle. we had to park outside the place."
