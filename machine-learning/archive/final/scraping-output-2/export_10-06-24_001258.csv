Having a private all natural Hotspring pool in your room is epic!!! Too bad it‚Äôs quite a journey from central bali otherwise I would be there very often üíóüíóüíó,"Penatahan hot springs are recommended places to visit for family and friends. Located on Jalan Buruan, Penatahan Village, Penebel District, Tabanan Regency and will take 1 hour 30 minutes to arrive there from I Gusti Ngurah Rai Airport. The location of this hot spring is close to the river so you can also take pictures there. With a price of fifteen thousand rupiah per person for a public hot spring pool you can enjoy hot water that makes the body relax. There are 3 types of pools for the public, the first is a small pool close to the river, a pool with a fairly large size with a bamboo shower, the third pool with a height of 1-meter is usually used by children, one restaurant, spacious parking, a place to bathe and change clothes. There is a private hot spring for twenty-five thousand per person, you can enjoy the hot spring privately in the form of a room. Not only hot water is available there but there is cold water there too. There is one restaurant near the pool, if you want to soak while the food is very possible, the price offered is also quite cheap. Operating from 7 am to 8 pm you can take an unlimited bath and enjoy the hot water. For those of you who like photos, there are many photo spots with the background of rivers, nature, trees, and gardens neatly arranged.",Good food and service from itaa and charles and fod was good very recommended,"Here is my review after visited this place:

(+) Positive:
- Have a spacious parking lot.
- The green natural scenery is will feast your eyes.
- Easy to access from Denpasar.
- The hot spring has 2 kinds of pools, public and private pool. If you like crowds, the public pool is your choice, however, the water not too hot. If you want to relax, enjoy the day and don't want to be bothered by others, the private pool is the choice.
- Ticket prices are affordable.
- Suitable for families.

(-) Negative:
- If it's crowded and you want to use the private pools, you have to wait it, can be up to 1 hour. At this time, you can try to soak on the public pool.","We really enjoyed the hot springs here. We rented a private space for 4 adults and 3 kids, the size was nice. It would be nice if they provided fresh towels. Also some relaxing music would have been nice to enhance the experience. Afterwards we tried their restaurant which definitely needs improvement. Given 4 stars for the way the service is set up in nature but the facilities need better upkeep. It's definitely worth one visit. I had an accident a few days before we visited and had open wounds on my legs which healed rather quickly. Guessing the sulphur in the water helped."

Towels are provided and staff are very helpful.
we had a nice little area which was lovely and warm","It's a good place but if you can choose a room please choose the one located in higher place. Also the timing for private bath seems off, we didn't even get close to 1 hour inside the private bath room but the timer already call us","Love it was so quiet and we had amazing healing time ü•∞ü•∞ they have 1 hit spring next to river, 3 public hot spring, big 1 swimming pool and private hot spring",Overall pretty good. Just needs a bit of repairs. Definitely recommended. Very kid friendly. My three-year-old was very happy when he mentioned that he can touch the bottom of every pool.,"So far the better hot springs I visited until now , entrance is 50000 rupiahs ,nice view and surroundings, recommend"

As a foreigner public pool is 50k/person and private 100k/person. The private one just have your own bath and I think it feels a bit inconvenient. They are 3-4 pools which is warm and real hot spring. The food and drinks are decent price. The toilets and shower place need to be improve.

Overall is good enough and here easy to find on the map!","This place looked underated but actually super awesome. This hot spring resort is a great choice for a trip with family and friends to enjoy the hot water with cheap price, even for local. They have several public natural pools, as well as private pools. Hot water is natural from a water spring containing sulfur that good for your skin health. The place is located 1 hour by car from Denpasar city. On the way you can enjoy the terraced paddy fields.","Food was surprisingly gorgeous, we've had a lot of this style (counter holding random foods, point at it and hope for the best) of food, and this is the best in a long time.  Lemongrass chilli chicken was the best, and the pork with amazing yellow sauce was a close second.  Not a bad view too, although it's not the idillic rice fields view you can get elsewhere.","Love the sight, love the water, friendly people, the problem was just the bathroom only has 2 rooms for the public pool.. But it also has a private room which has their own bathroom","Hot spring pool... Will so crowded on holiday season
But they have private pool also"
