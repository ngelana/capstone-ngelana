Loved ‚Äòem both. Of course, cabin has more to offer: compact toilet & bathroom inside, pantry, sofa bed, more lights and better view. But tent also offers different experience.

Expect chirping birds and sound of nature 24/7, the ability of breathe easily and effortless calming mind.

Staffs are helpful and communicative. Totally recommended.","I am not a fan of glamping. But I changed my m8nd when I went to Puku Pods. I love the cabin as it has an ensuite bathroom. The location is very close to  the Jatilewih rice terraces. It is walking distance to Yeh Hoo Falls.   When you stay at Puku Pods, you are treated like family. Stress-free, relaxing and very beautiful with rice fields all around you. Puku Pods is a place you want to go to if you want to escape the touristy places of Bali.","We had really good time at Puku Pods,
The location and surroundings was great. Rooms and public space are clean, there was only 4 tents and 2 cabin which is good so not crowded. Food and BBQ are simply yummy! Our kids loved it.
We looking forward for our next trip there!","Absolutely loved my two night stay at Pukupods, firstly the area is so serene and relaxing. The team at Pukupods were so welcoming and accommodating. The cabins and tents were all spacious, clean and comfy! I can‚Äôt wait to come back and spend a weekend here! & they‚Äôre pet friendly, big win ‚ú® thank you Pukupods!!!","Very nice glamping experience. Tent was comfortable, sharing toilet also clean and nice. Definitely will go back!"

The villa also provides a ""Bale"" to do meditation. If you are a spiritual traveller, you will like to stay in this place for your retreat.
