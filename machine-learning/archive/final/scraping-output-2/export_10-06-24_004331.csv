Tabanan, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 80351, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=12689731144180889835,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 8945484,hotel,"hotel, resort_hotel, lodging",4.5,417,,"I stayed 2 nights in Riverside Suite, room is spacious, clean, so comfy and calm, but there's a little bit spider nest in mask statue. Staffs are nice, full of smile, toiletries are complete. Access from reception area to my room is kinda difficult as we arrived at evening we had to pass rice fields in the darkness and road is so small, lucky us we bought motorcycle and a guy guided us to our room.

Thank you for your awesome service.","The experience depends greatly on which room you're in.

They have basically 3 types of room:
- private bungalows along the river and rice fields next to the smaller swimming pool in the main area
- modern rooms next to the restaurant facing the rice fields and the large swimming pool
- two rooms in the back, in the staff courtyard, next to the familly traditional kitchen

During our first stay last year we had one of the bungalows and it was great. We slept with the sound of the river, and woke up with the view of the rice fields. This was one of the most relaxing stays in Bali.

Our second stay this week was in one of the backyard room (room no. 107), and wasn't pleasant at all. We had trouble sleeping, with noise coming from the room next to us and more importantly the constant noise from the scooters on the main road to the night market. We then awoke early to the loud voices and laughter of the staff in the kitchen. We asked for a change of room but they refused, saying that they were fully booked (despite some availability on Booking). This wasn't a pleasant stay.

I would thus rate the bungalow experience 5/5 and the back room experience 1/5, hence an average of 3.

The restaurant is located 200 meters from the main area through the rice fields. The food is good (but not great), and the prices are reasonable.

Also note that Grab service is not available at the property, but Gojek is. As most often in Bali, the taxi service from the hotel is overpriced.

You can do free walks in the rice fields from the hotel, with the opportunity to observe traditional agriculture.","This place is wonderful. We loved our tranquil stay here.
The staff are all amazing . Always happy, welcoming and so helpful.
The food in the resturant was delicious! We were more than happy to eat there 3x a day.
We loved the offering making activity. Was beautiful to learn some of their proud culture.

Room was beautiful and comfortable.

We stayed in a balanese bungalow, which has no sound layer between us and our neighbour. So you need to whisper.","Blissful Retreat Surrounded by Nature

Tucked away amidst stunning rice fields, this place is a real gem. The staff are wonderfully and  friendly, adding to the laid-back vibe. The restaurant serves up tasty treats, and the pool is a refreshing oasis.

Sure, there are a fair share of bugs and ants, but hey, it's all part of the nature experience!

Thanks for the stay!","Our family visited this place to have a late breakfast on our way North. Staff is good, standard restaurant prices on the upper middle. We have been asked to pay 50k per person for using completely not occupied pool, even for 5 years old kid. (Like a temple tickets :( ). Pool water was far away from crystal clear, there is no shade areas near the pool. 2 stars means 2 stars‚Ä¶"

But the portion is just perfect. Not too small, not too big. Price just right too. I love the yellow soup and sate lilit, and especially the lawar / vege.

I dont usually like sate lilit and lawar as it is usually have the strong bali herbs taste that doesn't go well with my tastebud, but their lawar here taste refreshingly goooood. Rarely find babi guling with daun singkong too, but here they have.

Pork is succulent and juicy. I suggest ordering extra sate lilit on the side, its small but so goood. They suggest drink with orange juice.",one of the yummy bigul in Bali. Have to try!! pro tip just order from gojek because it's way too far!! love the crispy thingy & it's only 30k. Recommended!,"Taste really nice, but not really enjoy the satay. They also include the liver as well, might need to request not include that if you're not a fan of it.","If you wish to try local dish Babi guling, the is the local stall to experience on your way to Ulu danu beratan temple.","Every time I visit my family in Mengwi, this is my choice for Balinese food or, whenever I visit Tanah Lot.

Men Lari, Originally and originated from Mengwi, providing all-pork menu.

Didn't get the picture of roasted suckling pig. Next time. :)"

What a delightful and tranquil place. Tabanan is not busy with tourists, the resort itself was very peaceful with no disruptions from other guests. This resort has true Balinese hospitality and the locals in the village are absolutely beautiful people. I cannot fault this resort and highly recommend it to everyone and anyone. It's superb. I can't wait to go back. Thank you to Donny for organising everything I needed, and to the staff who always made us feel welcome and respected.","I‚Äôve only spent a day at this very beautiful and peaceful resort surrounded by rice fields. The food is excellent, the resort is very clean, the staff is very friendly and speak fluent English. Just 30 min. from the airport or downtown but a romantic world away!","Average clean, needs some renovation in the few spots. But the view or panorama is relaxing. It's hard to find decent restaurants in the area except in the hotel, which is a bit expensive with few choices.","Very amazing place!!

In the middle of village, with antique buildings spread in the area.

They also collaborate with the local community, whenever there's a functions going on.","A beautiful compound with traditional buildings, three amazing pools and a wide choice of rooms and bungallows, embedded in nature. Great value, really."
