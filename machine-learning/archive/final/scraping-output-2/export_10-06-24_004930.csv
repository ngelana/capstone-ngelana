The Staff very friendly and helpful, nice atmosphere inside, aircon building, and safety check outside. Clean restaurant barea, clean Toilet and clean washtafle. The sauce cup, drink cup and straw need to replace with eco friendly materials.

This located at Jl. Kediri across of Fuel station before the bridge from Soekarno Statue, on the right side. Easy to find, they have big Red M logo. They also provide Musholla on the corner of parking, cleaned and sanitized too üòÅüôè","The employees are friendly, The food taste really good. There's nothing I can describe though, But overall, It's good!","24 hours open, drive through is available but service so poor when we got here at 3.15 am.

The v60 coffee was good, nothing special about the coffee & the food. But the best part of this place was next to jungle and river, so if you looking for nice work from coffee shop i think i recommend this place cause it‚Äôs quite and good ambiance.","The service was nice, the food taste isn't similar to the one in Denpasar, the options are very less because many of the menu aren't available yet (we arrived at 12 for lunch).

No coaster provides for the glass, our table was all wet because of the melting ice.

Need improvement here and there","Foods are amazing! Desserts are amazing, we ordered Mango and Passion fruit Panna Cotta, is sweet and soury, the pannacota is good as it is and the bread pudding, maybe they can add coconut or brown sugar instead of caramel so it won't be too sweet even with the ice cream..The carbonara feels so good with grated Parmesan and the mushrooms gave some earthy taste to it.. it's a good combo..
The BBQ beef ribs nailed the taste, still need some char and maybe it's better to smoke it than boil it, so the fat could rendered even more.. the fries? It's sooo good, with their lot of drinks varieties, the menu's diverse than the denpasar ones.. For me? It's an amazing places to eat!","Good, cozy place for eating with serene jungle vibes. The service was very good. The drinks especially the fresh juices were very good. However, some of the food needs improvement. We tried Nasi Goreng Inkjection which was quite good, but the Soto Betawi tasted more like lontong cap gomeh instead.

Hope it can get better üòä","Lusi & Pakan Tabanan, the second family cafe opened after Lusi & Pakan, Denpasar city. I came here one week right before the 1946 Caka New Year celebration on the island of Bali in year of 2024.

Strawberry tea was the first hot drink I ever enjoyed. At 16 WITA that time I arrived. Walking 350 meters to the cafe made the gastronomy enough to process my dinner carbohydrates at Cafe Lusi & Pakan. Mahi mahi with rich matah chili sauce.

The Lusi & Pakan Tabanan cafe menu is not much different from the first cafe. Delicious menu with large portions, creative presentation, attractive to the eye. Balinese, Indonesian, Italian and Western fusion cuisine. All menus are suitable for everyone's taste. One person only needs to spend 50 - 100K for food & drink. The feeling of comfort in the physical body certainly makes people come again and again.

The unique and identical characteristic of the Lusi & Pakan cafe is that it was built near the river, located in a forest that still remains among the dense city. A healthy place for tired eyes from a week of work.

Lusi & Pakan takes approximately 1 hour/ 24 km from the city of Denpasar to Kediri, Tabanan - Bali. You can use public transportation, Kawan Bus, if you have enough time. From Central Parking Kuta at 6 am via Denpasar to the final stop terminal in Pesiapan, Tabanan. Head to Lusi & Pakan, the nearest stop at Simpang Grogak Selatan - Jl. Ir. Soekano, Tabanan. Bus operating hours are 06:00 to 21:00 WITA. If you want to take the bus back to Denpasar, try to be at the stop at 17 WITA.

The morning jogging agenda might be an alternative in the Banjar Demung area, it has cool air in a green area, that's how smart Lusi & Pakan cafe was built. Perfect for enjoying coffee & lunch in a cafe with tropical architectural style - semi-Mediterranean, wooden and semi-joglo. The main entrance is made of a beautiful arrangement of river stones. Casual clothing boutiques, jewelry, aroma therapy products are part of the community cafe. This cafe is pet friendly.

After walking through the village of Jalan Rambutan, a winding asphalt road and forest, at the end of the bridge that divides the two villages, just to the right of the road, Lusi & Pakan cafe will reward your exploration."
