They provided free tastings of different coffees and teas. The environment was serene and peaceful, perfect for enjoying a cup of Luwak coffee at an affordable price.","What a special experience! Such a beautiful hidden gem and an amazing place to try coffee and tea that you have probably never heard of before.

You get given a giant complimentary tasting tray and told about the process of making the tea and coffee, as well as getting to see all of the spices and fruits that are grown in the plantation garden. You can also try Luwak coffee but the best is the avocado, coconut and ginseng coffee and the rice tea! I bought almost the whole store to take home 🥰",This was such a great experience to see how coffee and tea are made and then sample a variety of teas and coffees. It’s nice that they have a tour guide that explains to you what each tea helps you with . Everyone is very friendly there . My son who is 6 even enjoyed it there . Everything was delicious,"Free coffee tester. Good service and the staffs were nice and patience.

I went for their swing. Paid IDR50,000 for the dress and got to sit on the swing for photos. They really tried very hard to get me good photos and videos. No queue, recommended for tourist who just wants to try the swing and for pictures purpose.","Wonderful coffee tasting experience. If you love coffee, cocoa or herbal teas then this is your place to go to. You may end up buying lots of coffee, fair warning."

From the very first moment, we felt welcomed and well taken care of.

Breakfast was a highlight every morning - a diverse selection of delicious dishes left nothing to be desired. Our room was impeccably clean and in perfect condition, a true oasis of well-being.

We were particularly impressed by the exceptional friendliness and attentiveness of all the staff members. They were always helpful and accommodating. A complimentary shuttle service to the center of Ubud was available, and discounted taxi rides to any destination could be booked at any time.

A special commendation goes to Ayu, a staff member who not only served us charmingly during dinner and cocktails but also shared many interesting things about Bali and provided valuable travel tips. Her warm nature made our stay truly special.

Hotel Royal Casa Ganesha is a real gem in Ubud. We highly recommend it and look forward to returning soon. A big thank you to the entire team for the unforgettable days!","Very nice location, but the rooms are dirty and the furnitures and facilities are very old. Breakfast is very average. This is not a four star hotel, it might had a four star ages ago but at best it is a 2 star. Amazing location and pity that such an amazing hotel  in amazing location lost its former glory. Done get fall in trap of the miss advertising and if you are after a 4 star stay. This is clear example of misleading advertisement. Staff were friendly but it will not compensate for the lack of management, facilities or very uncomfortable facilities or cleanliness. Also they will not give you enough card key for the room. Pool towels are dirty.","Stayed there with family and friend's family with 4 kids. Very peaceful place away from traffic and noise... Amazing staff, very well maintained throughout, huge area with various facilities like yoga  hall, beautiful pool, big garden with variety of plants, flowers, fountains, night lights, security, cleanliness all perfect.... Rain added an extra layer of freshness and beat to the view... We had free massage which was way better than paid once in the main city area... They sent a room service around 11pm on request which was miised due to our silly mistake of door tag placed wrong way......","** Avoid the restaurant ** My partner and I had dinner there twice and on both occasions I ended up very unwell with Bali Belly and he was unwell after the second visit. Not only that the staff over charged for our happy hour 2 for 1 drinks and charged for 2 Shishas when we only had one. Breakfast menu is OK (rather basic) but the staff forget to bring things out multiple mornings.

The 1 bedroom villa was nice. Upgraded when we arrived after getting a lower rate with the hotel directly. We wouldn't pay the full price rate advertised for it as there are nicer villas out there. Villa windows had a large gap in them so wasps and lizards were able to get in without the window being open. Overall I don't think we will be returning.","Amazing hotel with amazing staff. We have stayed there twice in recent times and cannot fault it.
Well worth the few extra dollars!"

Good vibes. Good service. I ate here twice while in Indonesia. I enjoyed my meal both times. The first time I sat wherever I wanted because the restaurant was empty. The second time they were busy so and I had to sit where I was told. So if you want special seating make a reservation.,"This restaurant set up is superb, a huge spacious place with idols, plants, grass fields and paintings. It was well occupied with good number of customers. Welcome drink and 3 types of chips were provided. We tried Nasi Campur, Steamed Fish Balinese style and Ginger Fizz. We wanted to try local food only and as expected the food was tasty and cooked with local spices/sauces. Do visit and try their menu!!","The service was good although some of them are not really responsive. The atmosphere was so relaxing because you could feel the wind, see the rice field and God Ganesha Statue there. Unfortunately the food taste was so weird, maybe because they wanted to combine some ingredients or something else but IMHO that's not a good idea. The parking lot was quite large. The price was quite expensive.","A must try in Ubud! The staff are wonderful, the scenery is beautiful and the food is delicious! I had the chicken satay and the most delicious mie goreng I’ve tasted! The portion size is huge and the prices affordable. Highly recommend!","Found this gem just a few hundred metres from where I was staying, quite by accident. The service was impeccable, the food was absolutely delicious, and they even offered a lift back to the accomodation without hesitation."

It's a new property with a pool big enough to do laps, the most comfortable bed I've slept in, and sparkling clean rooms.

I stayed here during a meditation teacher training at Yoga Barn. It's about a 10min scooter ride away. You can get cheap scooter rentals from Ubud. It was nice to actually stay outside of Ubud because it's much noisier and chaotic in the city center.

Finally, Gede and his family are phenomenal hosts. Super kind and responsive. You won't be disappointed staying here during your trip to Bali.",The place is beautiful! Like a real paradise. Rooms are nice and clean and bathroom has open roof window so you feel like outside. Owners are kind.. don’t accept credit cards. Very peaceful place. Definitely recommend.,Had a nice experience at Ubud Batan Nyuh. The hosts are super friendly.

This place is just perfect for a chilled out getaway.
Amazing gardens full of life, frogs,  birds, bugs and more. Don't worry the bugs don't attack you.
Pool area is lovely overlooking the rice fields.
You can get a massage poolside if you like.
Staff are willing to help you and always happy and smiling making you feel good.
The rooms are small bungalows, so are huge, nice big bathroom with clear roof.
Outside the hotel and on the streets there are some interesting shops and local restaurants ( cheap as )
Even found a fishing shop.
Come and enjoy getting away from the tourist traps and relax 😌 😎","Booked 3 nights but in the 3rd night,  a gecko was found in the room at about 10pm.  We tried reaching out to staff,  walked all the way to front desk but there was no one. Walked to the back kitchen,  no one was around either.
As we cannot stay in a room with a gecko,  we booked another hotel and left our room key at the front desk. So we didn't complete our stay here.
What disappointed us was there was no staff around,  even though there was supposed to be 24 hr front desk.
During our stay there,  we did not see any other guests either.  It was scary for me.
The place is old,  but the room was neat and clean. Bathtub looks old and dirty,  dare not use it.  Of course there was lizard sound and ants around.  But we could stay with these.  We just can't with a gecko.
Breakfast was simple but big portion and faces rice fields,  which is nice.

To their credit,  the staff,  when they were around,  were friendly.  First night here,  they arranged for a driver to bring us to restaurant for dinner where we spent over IDR700,000 for 2 persons.  Food was nice though.

If you like surrounded by nature,  this will be nice.  I just cannot sleep with the gecko in the room, and with no staff around to help, this really killed the joy. I won't stay here again.","The place is nice, but needs a lot of maintenance. It's a bit far from Ubud market. The location and atmosphere are good. The air conditioning didn't work well and it was too humid. Overall, the stay was fine, but they should move the AC for better comfort.","Calm and cool place in the midst of nature and rice fields.
Pool view and cleanliness, food , Spacious rooms,Excellent customer serice .
overall *****","The staff are super friendly and helpful.
The day we arrived, they called a car to take us to the restaurant for dinner.
The hotel spaces are very beautiful.
As it is inserted in nature, I was a little afraid of bugs, but we did not have any unpleasant encounters in the room."

I respect Wanyan and his family for how carefully they have managed this place. No a/c here, so a lot of windows, and keep it open. The wind is very cool and the surroundings are all green. It's only 10 minutes away from Main Ubud, but all I can hear is the sound of nature. I was really sad to leave here. It's such a beautiful place.

The perfect balance between a traditional Balinese home in tropical gardens with all the comforts for a relaxing holiday, such as a new pool on the rice fields and reliable Wifi.

Nyoman, Made and their family may be some of the sweetest, most caring and loving people on this earth. When we arrived (after coordinating a taxi pickup from the Airport through them), they were waiting for us with beautiful smiles welcoming us into their home. During our 2.5 weeks, not only did they help us with recommendations for things to see and do (of which there is plenty), they also took us to wonderful local experiences themselves.

There is so much to do in Bali and we had so much fun exploring all of their recommendations, but our fondest memories will be of us playing cards and dominoes down in the lush garden with their loving family.
