Made was a wonderful host. Rustic and beautiful,"This place was paradise! In the middle of rice fields... So romantic, and peaceful and PERFECT WIFI !
I thought it might have many mosquitoes but surprisingly! There was actually none!!
The shower has hot water , nice pressure.. and a stunning view from the room and attic !
The hosts are just so nice and helpful.
The place is quite humid but also super ventilated, the cabin stayed cool at all times.

It is about 25 minutes from Ubud center but there are gojeks and also you can rent a scooter for aprox $4 usd per day.","Wow, such an amazing place to stay some nights (or even longer)!
Great host, so friendly!!!
We had a massage there on the ground level of our treehouse in the evening and enjoyed the stay very much!","Absolute gem of a place to spend a few nights, peaceful and relaxed ambiance in a picturesque rice field. Just far enough from ubud to escape the busy town life and experience the true Balinese culture.
Very comfortable beds and awesome hot shower, full kitchen and even good WiFi in this remote location.","My girlfriend and me loved this treehouse! Surrounded by rice fields, calm and peaceful. The host was really friendly and helpful. All in all was it the perfect accommodation for us :)"

No entry fee, but a donation box at the top of the stairs. It was very quiet, we were the only ones there. Could enjoy our time there, even had leaf races down the river!","Nice waterfall, Somewhere different to visit, Free parking, lots of steep steps to the bottom of the waterfall, There is a donation box if you wish to donate money, Not suitable for disabled people.","Hard to find but totally worth it! The entry is in between the temple and bridge. We were the only visitors and did not see anyone else.

A must do!",Went with Pak Suteja who was very knowledgeable about the area and culture. Lovely experience!,"Completely beautiful waterfall and very near Ubud, just 20 minutes north. Don't miss this one if you're in the neighborhood."

The jungle view with the private pool and charming 2 level house was full of joyous experiences. The young couple running the place were very friendly and accommodating for all our requests.
If we can we will definitely return again!","The villa is very strategically located
15-20 minutes to ubud center
10 minutes to Tirta Empul Temple
8 minutes to the gunung Kawi tourist attraction,
25-30 minutes to Mount Batur
10 minutes to Manggening Temple
very close to warungs, traditional markets
the locals are very friendly and happy to communicate","This is the best place for the value that I have stayed in around Ubud. It is a beautiful property surrounded by jungle which is very peaceful, and it has an amazing pool

Sudana and Kadek are the owners who are very friendly. I can genuinely call them my friends.

This place is a Gem!",Recently stayed at the villa which was lovely. Beautiful location and run by a lovely family. Highly recommend.,"The atmosphere is very calm and comfortable, clean, peaceful
The local people are very friendly"

Brilliant hospitality, friendly staff, beautiful villa. What a garden! This villa has its own climate, when it is hot and stuffy outside, you feel yourself really comfortable and cool at the villa. The owner of the villa covered all our needs: helping buy the food, airport transfer, renting a car at the best price in Ubud, money transfers.

We would like to express our highly appreciation to you, Maru. You made us feel like we are at home! If we would come to Bali we would definitely come to you.

Thank you and your staff!","For our vacation in Bali we spent several days in this hotel, we were the first customers and I must say that we were very well received. The hotel is beautiful, the view is splendid, and the room is very nice. We were able to choose our breakfast every day and I must say that the nicest thing is the hosts. They are of an incomparable kindness, I really recommend this accommodation, a real haven of peace. We will come back to it.",Really beautiful. Great management as well. Just 7 minutes from empathy school on the nice quiet back roads.,,

Very hospitable chef who kept bringing us gifts including freshly picked mangosteen and durian from the trees nearby. We had a great evening.  Just send them a WhatsApp before going over to avoid what the other reviews are saying about needing a reservation.,"We came here for dinner without reservation, thinking it was just like regular eatery, but how wrong we were. You absolutely need to make reservation, because it seems to me that they mainly do cooking class and delivery orders. There was only one table that could sit 4-6 people, surrounded by a garden and a stream somewhere I couldn't see through the darkness. I bet it would be really relaxing here during the day. We felt bad for coming here without booking first. I think the owner and his whole family were quite surprised by our visit, but welcomed us so warmly and did their best to serve us. We ordered a whole duck that was so big that it was more than enough for the five of us, but so yummy and tender that we did try to finish it. It came with sambal matah and sambal goreng that were unique and amazing! Also steamed rice, sauteed veggies, and tum (I think chicken, it was delicious too). They initially said that they were not ready with the side dishes except the rice, so were pleasantly surprised when they came with those dishes. This is definitely a local business that is worthy of our support.
Btw, the trip from Ubud would have also been scenic had we come during the day.","Thats
