Gede is very friendly, helpful and ensures that everything is fine for you. The bed is comfy, private garden and the breakfast is really generous. Highly recommended.","Gede’s homestay is the perfect stop if you’re between Lovina and Amed or looking to visit some of Bali’s black sand beaches. The room is very large, comfortable, and clean. It is really quiet, has good water pressure, has a fridge and freshwater in the room, and has AC. The homestay is only a minute from the beach and Gede is so kind and helpful. We will definitely be back!","We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Gede’s Homestay. Geode is a wonderful host, nothing was too much trouble. The room was very comfortable and clean, the wifi excellent and we loved the comfy seating on the verandah for chilling out. With just the one room you have the whole space to yourself and if possible, Gede will get you access to the pool and beach through the property he supervises. Try the grilled tuna for two!","Absolutely great accommodation!
I stayed here for three nights with my husband and we loved our stay!
Gede is amazing, kind and helpful. He will help you with whatever you need and make you feel so much at home with his hospitality and flexible arrangements.
The room is clean and spacious.
The location is perfect if you are looking for a peaceful place to stay. Very closely/ conveniently located to the beach.
For the price we paid, it is by far one of the best 'bangs for the buck'. We will definitely return!","We had a great relaxing overnight stay with Gede. What a lovely guy! It is just one room at the gatehouse that he lives in to work at an amazing villa. This is extra income for him. And he deserves it. Nothing was a problem. He went and got us beer, then dinner. And all the tea and coffee you wanted.
The room was comfy, clean and had good air con. We put it on only 26° because the night was cool.
We spent the afternoon relaxing on the porch couch drinking beer and coffee.
Look, it is on the main road, it is not by the sea but it suited us on our trip home.
Comfort, comfort. And such a nice guy.
Please call in and support him."
