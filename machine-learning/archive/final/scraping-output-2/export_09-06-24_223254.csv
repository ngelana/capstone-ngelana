20k entry per person. One of the few places it feels good value, as it’s a good concrete road all the way, with beautiful scenery and the best destination.
The swings and hearts were closed when we went.

We were the only ones there! At 17 in the afternoon.
The drive there is truly amazing as well, and surprisingly good roads

Attention! We went a 2nd time, and this time there were other people at the parking trying to charge 100k per person.
Do not pay them.

Go down the path, a ticket stand is there for 20k","Very nice waterfall. It's around 30-40 min going down and back. But there is a local booth. Local people charge you anything between 150 to 200k per person, 20k for Indonesian. Very expensive. Not worth it.","This is the biggest and tallest waterfall in Bali. You need to trek around 20 minutes to reach to this waterfall and sometimes you might find yourself lonely as a visitor but you should continue your trek to reach at the waterfall place.

You will find yourself satisfied once you will reach to this waterfall and there are many selfie points where you can click pictures.

Please take care of your footsteps during the trekking to reach to this waterfall as in some places the stairs are very high and at some places the stairs are narrow and slepy.

You can buy soveniers from here but it’s costly and you can bargain with the prices here.",This is the only water fall I went there. Not very crowded.  The guide at the waterfall was very helpful. Great place. Highly recommend. The way to this water fall was superb.,"The trek to Git Git Waterfalls was truly delightful. The trail led us through serene surroundings, and reaching the main waterfalls was a rewarding experience. Along the way, we discovered charming swing photo spots that added to the adventure. A must-visit for nature enthusiasts and photography enthusiasts alike!"
