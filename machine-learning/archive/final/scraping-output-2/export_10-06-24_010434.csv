Atmosphere is fantastic and the rooms with private pool are a blast. Food in the restaurant in also very good.
The location is a bit off, but that does not matter as you can easily get a taxi to anywhere!
A big thank you also to Mr Angaa for his fantastic hospitality! Service is so excellent at this place! Can only recommend a stay here!","We really enjoyed our stay at Harsono. The river view and rooms are amazing, we stayed at two and three bedrooms villa and my favorite was the two bedroom villa with the kitchen inside. We got sick during our stays and the staffs were very helpful. Breakfast was great, we liked our chicken porridge. Keep in mind that the location is quite remote so it takes some time to get to many famous locations. Overall we had a wonderful experience at Harsono.","My child, father and I love this place. It‚Äôs a wonderful place to have vacations. We live in the room Sanur, this room has a cute swimming pool which have the view of river and the beautiful dining place, we enjoy a good swim here after exhausted tour all day. We have dinners in our room within two nights cause there is a lovely kitchen here, the meal is perfect, environment is quiet with some noice of frogs and birds. We chat, rest and enjoy the meal very much. Last but not least, all of the staff here is warm, and reply to every my requests immediately. Thank you for everything that we really have good time here, see you next time.","Stayed in one of the upstairs villas and it was very clean. I felt very safe. The restaurant on site was delicious, although prices were high by Indonesian standards - you'd be better off going to Sanur or something. They offer a laundry service and charge based on the number of items. Bit pricey but convenient. The hotel is not located near any touristy spots - you'll need to take a taxi. Ubud is an hour away and is super touristy. there are some local waterfalls that you can visit. The staff are excellent and kind.","Harsono Resort is an absolute gem! The vibe there is like stepping into a chill paradise ‚Äì super laid-back and relaxing. Cleanliness? Spotless.
Coziness? Off the charts.
Impeccable cleanliness and cozy interiors made my stay exceptionally comfortable.
The rooms are huge, and the bathrooms are basically spa-level fancy.

And let's talk about that pool with a killer river and resort view ‚Äì epic! It's like your own private oasis.
The staff? Legends. So welcoming and always on point.The staff's warm welcome and attentive service added a personal touch to my stay, making it truly memorable.
Seriously, if you're in Bali and looking for a getaway with all the good vibes, Harsono is the spot.
5 stars? More like 5 galaxies!"

I visited KEBON as one of my friend who travelled last year insisted me to visit on way to Airport from Bali. We spent a 1 hour time with family and kids and this place is super awesome. What a humongous effort and time invested for more than 50 years to built this car museum with so many beauties still in running condition. This needs a special taste and effort and kudos the owner who‚Äôve built this in rugged style. Seeing vehicles from model T to old Chevvys and other beautiful ladies was awesome. The team who helped me to see through all cars and special mention to @sangayumirah Mirah who briefed me on all cars and the museum layout. Highly recommended for all car enthusiasts if you‚Äôre in Bali ü§ó,"Over 200 classy cars from Ford T to a modern roadster, most of them are in good condition. Some are even available to rent!
The restaurant was a disappointment. We took tom yam soup, margarita pizza and local chicken plate (opens the menu) and none of them tasted as they are supposed to.
There is a small playground to entertain children for a bit.","Kebon classic cars is a hidden gem of Bali. There are over 200 cars here. Easily spend a couple hours wandering through.
It‚Äôs only about 20 minutes from Sanur and well worth a visit.","Perhaps the most surprising element of my recent visit to Bali is this treasure trove of a place. Pristine and expansive collection of cars from across continents, housed in a carefully laid out facility. Had under an hour before by flight - would strongly recommend spending half a day appreciating the art on display. While there are many gems, my most fav is the collection of Chevy Bel airs. Must visit for anyone who loves classic cars.","Wow this place is amazing , it is so much bigger than I realized.
So much nostalgia here with over 200 cars from around the world along with trucks , army vehicles and tuk tuks.
We had a lovely lady show us around who gave us so much information on the complex and the cars.
There is a merchandise shop and a cafe on site too.
Lovers of cars and car history will lose themselves for hours here"

They have indoor and outdoor space, the indoor is not air-conditioned but its very open so not feeling hot, the outdoor space might suit for dinner except if you want to do sunbathing sauna while having lunch.
The location has a little distance from downtown, but not too far if you are at Sanur area. So if you are around, come and visit them.",Had a great dinner here! All dishes taste good and the seafood was so fresh. The owner was very friendly and shared the story of the restaurant with us. Must try if you are around.,"Very good restaurant, fresh seafood with local prices, you can even order seafood in advance, lobster, crab, shrimp, etc.","The food was amazing especially the grilled fish I was recommend by one of the staff.i am a sea food lover and all I can say is I was happy,thanks so much for the amazing food and staff","We are very happy that we came to this place. Warung Pizarro is originally preserved beautiful architecture combined with Balinese handmade furniture. We ate there the best freshly caught Ruby fish, squid and a smoothie bowl. All the dishes looked beautiful and were totally delicious. The service was helpful, nice and passionately talked about this place and food and advised what to choose on that day.

This is quite a nice restaurant for being so far from any major city. It's pretty big and never crowded. in fact, you can quite possibly eat alone here. I think they make most of their money from events and catering. they have a nice patio and garden tables to choose from. Two things we especially like from the menu; first, the chicken schnitzel is excellent. Comes with potatoes and garlic vegis. Definitely a good choice, but my favoirte is the chicken batutu. in my opinion, it's the best batutu I've eaten in Bali so far. It's spicy, but not crazy hot. it's a large portion, comes with fries and vegis. Wash it down with a bintang and you're good to go.",They have many choices of Indonesian food and some of western food.
