Great location and just across the road from Kuta Beach. The resort was excellent with a great pool with plenty of deck chairs and excellent pool side service. The rooms where very comfortable and clean with plenty of room and a good sized balcony. We stayed on the second floor which had views of the pool. We had dinner there one night and the food was delicious and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend this hotel for everyone from solo travellers to families, there's a bit for everyone.","When we first arrived, they said we were upgraded to a deluxe room. (We had paid for a plunge pool room), so l asked to see the room, and it wasn't an upgrade at all. I then said l wanted the room l had booked. They then informed me that there had been a glitch in their system, and the plunge pool room wasn't available for 2 nights. I then asked for a balcony room with a pool view, which they gave us. I was very unhappy with how it was dealt with until the next day when the hotel manager Cindy was waiting for me after our breakfast. She apologised and asked me what she could offer me for the mix-up. I asked for my daughter and l to get a 90-minute spa treatment, which she was happy to do. I have to say they have gone out of their way to make what started as a terrible experience into a great stay","Lovely hotel is located next to the beach. The staff are all very friendly and helpful especially John from front desk. The room had some mosquitoes but this was revolved swiftly. The breakfast buffet was very good with a lot varieties. To summarize, I enjoyed my stay at the hotel and will not hesitate to return.","Can‚Äôt fault this place. Perfectly located we walked to most of the spots, markets, mini marts, beach, bars, cafe, SOOO many places to choose from to eat and all the stops we made to eat were so good üëåüèΩüëåüèΩ the beach is so close!

Breakfast at the hotel and the food in general and drinks were amazing. I had the mixed chargrilled bbq skewers with rice and peanut sauce twice because it was so good üëåüèΩ highly recommend.

Love music by the pool some nights which I loved as they sung some of the classics ü´∂üèΩ

We rented a room with 2 beds and partial sea view. When we visited, unfortunately the hotel was under renovation, so many places were covered with covers. But don't worry, they still prioritize guest comfort.

This hotel is located in a very strategic location. I love it! You just have to walk to Kuta beach. Around the hotel there are many clothing and food store. The hotel has a variety of restaurants, there is a swimming pool, gym and spa. The rooms are clean and spacious. The staff is very friendly and ready to help. The check in experience was very easy and fast.","Fantastic hotel with top service! All the staff are so polite and professional. Great location with access to the beach and restaurants. Shopping mall on the side with direct entrance from hotel is perfect. We enjoyed Bali Kuta and will definitely be back! Also, will come back to  Sheraton thanks to amazing staff because they make our stay extra special!","The hotel is very well located by the beach and a shopping mall. It's just so convenient to enjoy the sea, sand, and sun. During the heat, you could just escape inside a shopping mall without being in traffic. Staff have exceptional service mind at most of the touch points.","No good choice with small kids. While the kids club is small but good, the hotel facilities are not. If going with a pram anywhere there was always a need for two elevators. To go to  the kids club, there was no elevator so we had to carry the pram up and down the stairs everyday (staff always helped when they saw us).
Pool is very small, no fun area for kids.

Kuta is very very busy - even though the location of Sheraton is very good close to the beach. Breakfast is nice as well, people were very nice and handed balloons to our kids every morning.

We went to neighbouring hardrock Kuta one time - can‚Äôt compare. If going with small kids they will enjoy the resort-like feeling, water slides and all day entertainment.","Highly Recommend here , the staff very friendly and helpful.

- Environment very clean and they will help you to on aircond first before you enter your room. specially need to highlight they also have special activities for children , so also good for you to bring your family along.
-Location : Just next to the large shopping mall (2 min walking distance)  , good if you want buy things ."

We love the pool, very nice. The only shortcoming is the pool closed at 7:00pm, which is a bit too early.
The jacuzzi pool with warm water is a major PLUS.
The service of the staff is great - especially staff in front counter, concierge and restaurants.
Love the hotel. Truly.","The room is quite spacious so there is a special section for storing suitcases and there is also a balcony terrace. The pool is aesthetic and spacious, there is a children's pool with a slide and a palyground next to it. The food is all delicious and varied. And what makes it all perfect is that the staff is very friendly, sincere and helpful.

Upgraded room fresh fruit were offered and status was recognised by receptionist. Staff are incredibly friendly and provide  excellent service. Tonight, I encountered an issue with a baby crying next door from day to night tim,  but the staff promptly assisted me in changing rooms, which I greatly appreciated.

I‚Äôve been there three times and every time it has always been a fantastic experience.

The atmosphere is great. The food is so well cooked. Plenty of staff who are always there if you need them, and to top it off they make a nice full bodied coffee.

I always find myself hanging around for another half hour just having a post meal coffee and watching the world go by

I‚Äôm not a person who usually does that sort of thing, but this place is just so comfortable and welcoming.

My favourite place to eat in Bali","A very cute spot for lunch or snacking, and the service was kind and quite quick.

We ordered the chicken pesto salad which was very delicious, and the nachos dish which was great for sharing and a cute snack.
The dish we liked the least was their spring rolls which had a very industrial tase, and they were quite oily and generic.","The ambience of the cafe is great. You could meet up with friend, co-worker of even date here. The food is great. Their tuna is huge and taste good. Their drink was refreshing. Love to dine here. Definitely would come back here","When I read through the reviews, there are a couple of reviews about they got stomachache after visiting this place. It made me worried since my daughter had a very sensitive stomach. However, I still take a bet to visit it myself since there are still a lot of good reviews. Yes! Today is my 2nd visit in my 4 days stay in Bali (1 time dinner,  1 time lunch). All the food that I order is very delicious, my daughter loves it so much and we do not have any stomach upset at all. Kudos for the hard work to keep delivering good food and good service.","If you're in search of a delightful breakfast experience that seamlessly blends delicious Western cuisine with a charming ambiance, look no further than Crumb & Coaster in Kuta. From the moment you step through the door, you're greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere that sets the stage for a memorable meal.

It is in an incredibly loud and congested area, across from a public beach. You can rent chairs and watch the surfers while repeatedly turning down locals selling wares, one after another.
The room was SO small! No closet to unpack a suitcase, and no floor space to set it down on. No counter space by the sink to set anything, and the commode is about three feet from the bed with a glass door.
There are 150+ rooms, but only 12 loungers by the pool. Be prepared for A LOT of cigarette smoke on the roof by the pool. Restaurant was delicious and fairly priced, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating! This hotel may be fine for a 20-year-old looking to party, but if you want to relax or sleep, this is not the place for you. Very loud in the room all night long, until we moved hotels the next day, without refund for the three additional nights we were supposed to stay.","This hotel was fantastic, great location - about 5 min walk from beach walk shopping centre. Location was on the main strip but you couldn‚Äôt hear any traffic while in the rooms. Pool was fantastic, with awesome views of the ocean. Breakfast buffet had plenty of choices and all was tasty. Staff were all very friendly and accomodating. Would stay again!","Breakfast was amazing.. but unfortunately I called to complain that there was blood, hair n sand on my sheet n wanted new ones‚Ä¶ front desk didn‚Äôt seem interested in fixing the problem, no one ever came to give me new sheets. So I slept with a towel I had. Was not a very good experience n feeling very tired before my flight out.

Food at Afterglow restaurant was top notch.
Our room was super spacious and our baby enjoyed very well and well rested in the crib provided. The roof top infinite pool with never ending views of Kuta beach and flying flights.
Easy access to airport and all spots out there as it is located in heart of Kuta.",The first thing that greeted us in the room was a tiny roach on the counter beside the basin. My friend who was staying in a different room on a different floor had the same issue too. There must be a problem if two different rooms had roaches so I was feeling uncomfortable and made sure that I zipped up all my luggage all the time. The shower door couldn‚Äôt keep the water in too so water was splashed out and the floor mat was entirely soaked. We checked in really late and left in the morning so we didn‚Äôt have the chance to explore the hotel. Staff was really apologetic when she heard about the roach problem during check out though. Was glad that we were only staying just 1 night there.

Upon arrival, I had two large bouquets of flowers. Receptionist girl offered to store the flowers in our room in the bucket, but when we returned to collect the key, they informed us that they couldn't provide a bucket to keep the flowers in due to hygiene reasons, which was surprising as it had been offered initially. Then other guy (from reception) got into the conversation rolling eyes and speaking with someone in their language over the reception and laughing possibly at us, and backing up the girl saying that there is nothing in all building where I could keep my flowers to enjoy for the last days. Ruined all the mood on the spot. The room had an unpleasant smell, a moldy shower, and ripped towels, which gladly was sorted‚Ä¶ not the best experience!

On the positive note, the Kuta Social Club on the rooftop with its stunning views and tasty cocktails made up for it. The staff there were always smiling and welcoming, which improved our overall experience.
Location is perfect easy to commute around.","I just got back from Bali last week and I was staying at Mamaka by Ovolo for 8 nights in the swagger suite facing the sea. The room was superb. Very clean and the view from my room was spectacular. Overall the stay was very comfortable and nice. The staff is friendly and goes out of the way to make you comfortable. Their manager Ersa was also very sweet and accommodating.
However, there were a few drawbacks which the property management team needs to look into seriously.
My room was just below the rooftop bar and every morning just before the breakfast time at around 7am, the staff would start cleaning the rooftop shifting the furniture which made loud , heavy noise which was clearly heard in our room. The loud noises of furniture being moved every morning was very frustrating and immensely disturbing because we were woken up every morning between 6-6.30 am due to the loud noise.This is a major put off and very unfair to the guests who are on a holiday to rest and relax. The management should definitely take this seriously.

Room service is very slow. It takes almost 1-1.5 hours for food to come to your room after placing the order.
Spa girls are not trained well for hair services.
Overall the experience was great but these things if looked into can make a whole lot of difference in customer experience.","Located right in front of Kuta Beach in Bali, the hotel offers exceptional accessibility. There's also a convenience store right next door which adds to the convenience.

The rooftop area is particularly impressive with its vibrant atmosphere and breathtaking views. The music played by the DJ adds a lively touch that makes the experience even more enjoyable.

The rooms are clean and spacious, providing a comfortable stay.

The staff are all energetic and friendly. Krisan, in particular, was exceptionally helpful, managing everything from check-in to check-out with a smile","I recently stayed at Mamaka Bali and overall had a pleasant experience. The hotel boasts a prime location with easy access to shopping and restaurants, which was a big plus for me. The staff were friendly and provided excellent service throughout my stay.
One of the highlights was the fantastic pool, perfect for a refreshing swim. However, I did notice that the room could use a bit more upkeep and cleanliness.
Overall, I would recommend Mamaka for its convenient location, friendly service, and enjoyable amenities.","One of my personal favorite hotel in Kuta Area. Their Street32 is actually open for 24hours, great for a night owl like me. Weekend DJ start from breakfast, and the music don‚Äôt just stop there. Sunset from the rooftop is amazing, food is amazing, plenty choices of drinks, but I love my margarita most. They have this self laundry area, just right in front of the gym. So leave your laundry there and let it run while I do my morning rounds. Staff is awesome, friendly, and polite too, very helpful. Would definitely stay longer when I had the chance. Kudos to all Mamaka Team!! Keep rocking you guys üçª cheeers!"

Will definitely go back.","Decent hotel, clean rooms, close walk to the beach.  The staff at the front desk are extremely friendly.  Upon check in they noticed from my passport that my birthday was two days earlier so they surprised us with a cake in the room which was really sweet and unexpected. We had just come from the JW in Singapore, checking in on the day of my birthday, and the difference in the service and treatment between the two hotels was striking.

The staff is super friendly and every time you walk by someone they greet you friendly.
Sadly I got sick during my vacation but they quickly got a doctor to my room who got me up in running again in just a few days.
At breakfast the staff made sure I felt better and even the cleaning staff remembered my sickness and left me additional tissue boxes and water in the room - felt very welcomed!
The rooms look very modern and are very clean, only had smaller issues like the bathroom isn't very private or the walls aren't that soundproof.
The food was pretty good - not the best but definitely good, the breakfast has a vast variety and the restaurant at lunch was also delicious.
All in all I can only say this hotel is great and my stay was very positive even though of my health conditions - I can only recommend it.","I'm not a fan of Kuta, but I wanted to spend our last night closer to the airport.  I'm so happy I chose the Aloft Kuta.  Great location and delightful staff.  Enjoyed a lovely breakfast also.  The chef even made us something special.
Good value, and we'll return for a 1st or last night in Bali.

Very convenient - within walking distance to the beach, BeachWalk Mall, etc.

Yes, we can walk on foot to the beach & the mall.  WayYy much better than using cars, since we won't get stuck in the traffic & it's free of charge!!

It's pretty safe to walk in the evening/night since it's still very merry nearing midnite.

Staffs are nice & helpful, but not cooperatif.  I stay for a couple of days, some booked via AGODA online & some paid straight at the cashier.  The price is much cheaper if we book online.  No compromise for bargaining the price and the check out time.

The rooms are small (as worth the price) but better than hostels since we got privacy here (our own room).  The bathrooms & toilets are capsule-styled, the floor is quite slippery, we need to be careful when taking a shower.

On the first night I came around midnite, paid more (higher price), got a room with a broken air-con (hot & sweaty till the next day).  So  I got another room, which thankfully is better & the aircon is working fine.

They've also got a swimming pool in the hotel & guests are enjoying it (open free time until evening)!  But I don't swim, so no comment on that.

Breakfast is good, complete, & considered very economically priced!

Overall this is considered a good & worthy stay! ;)","The rooms are kinda small but cute and creatively, they've provided everything for you. The staff is amazing and help you with whatever you need.

This hotel is good with kids but they should clean the pool it looks like they never clean since they opened.

Second, theres lacking wall below my tap sink. Third i need to go like 7 billion times just to find this hotel that placed in the middle of ""forest"" :/","This is ok hotel. They have ample space for parking.
But the main issues with this hotel are different
1. They have no good breakfast option, cold too
2. Bathrooms in the room are makeshift and mare of plastic.
3. Washbasin in the room also look like fitted forcefully and stink. My room was 222

Loads of options from cereal, pastries, omelettes, sandwiches and rice and other hot food.","Centrally located hotel in front of Kuta Beach. We stayed for 5 nights and it was lovely experience. Breakfast was not included in our stay. And since we are vegetarian, i think it was good decision as there was nothing we can eat there. So i request them to add some dishes that vegetarian people can enjoy","We loved everything about this hotel.
The staff were very friendly, always acknowledged. The food was beautiful as was breakfast. The pool was to die for!! The bed was sooo comfy as well as the pillows!! The shower was just right with water pressure and temperature. Entertainment every night was fantastic!! Location was perfect.

All of the staff are extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. The security staff around Mr. Putu deserves special mention. Parking options (underground garage) are available and are constantly guarded by Mr. Putu's staff. A large hotel complex with several swimming pools and very well-kept and clean rooms. We recommend this hotel from experience.","it‚Äôs a pretty decent hotel but maybe they could upgrade some more parts of the hotel because the hallways and rooms look outdated. good customer service though, the employees are nice and helpful. location is nice as you can walk to the beach from the hotel.","Staffs are friendly and quick to help. Location is right in front of the beach and next to a small convenient store. They have several options for swimming pool, I didn't use it but I could see them being quite nice for families and kids especially for rooms with pool access.
The hotel was below my expectation for a supposedly 4 star hotel though. It needs to be maintained better. It felt dark and had an unpleasant stuffy smell. Having dehumidifier, perfume sprays and more lighting would help. I had to change my room because of smell from the bathroom, though the staff handled it quickly. Bedding was on the hard side.
Breakfast is ok, they cover the common ones (egg station, porridege, rice etc, bread etc, coffee/tea.","I came late since had work to do, ordered executive with balcony that they said the highest room that they provide. After check in :

1st room :
1. Hot, not properly AC
2. Sink cannot be used
3. Gloomy and dark. Lamp kinda too old.
4. Breakfast, not many choice. Ordered sunny side up with additional sausage, cheese and mushroom. And I got it, with raw mushroom.

Ask to change room with statement to make sure they give room with good AC

2nd room, still, with same AC condition.

I don't ask much but this time, not that good for personal experience. Btw, it's noisy since the hotel on the side of main street, and wind keep banging the balcony door. Put this into your consideration if you wanna stay in this area.

Last, for the staff, all good. As I don't expect much, i think all still in place (except the one that made me sunny side up)","I had the room with an ocean view, beautiful sunset from very big balcony. The room was spacious a we had all necessary appliances.
However, for the price, which definitely is not cheap there, I would have expected much more.
The view is beautiful, but there's very busy road right under, so you hear loud cars and bikes all night.
WiFi was very unreliable, slow and sometimes even not working, I had to completely rely on mobile data.
Bathroom was otherwise nice, but sink being too far from the water pipe was causing always wet surrounding which in turn causes GREEN MOLD all around sink (see the photo)!!!!
Cleaning of the room was not done properly in quite some time because we have found big pieces of dust hanging from the wall! (See the picture)
And lastly, I understand the need of air freshener in an elevator, but having a whole bottle which is supposed to be for much bigger room in a very small space such as an elevator is not great idea, the smell was so strong I could barely handle it."

The bar/restaurant is right next to the pool, and the staff and food were always amazing. I will stay again when I return to Bali.",We were 14 people & booked 7 rooms at Kuta Seaview Boutique. I recommended we all stay at this resort hotel because it was conveniently located for the daily tours we planned plus its proximity to the Benoa Cruise Port. There was a mix up with my room category but Bogart the manager got things fixed & got our suite ready for our check-in. Bogart was so helpful. Location is great. The restaurant had delicious buffet & menu food. Was a great way to start our daily activities. I highly recommend this resort in Kuta.,"This is a lovely hotel, the staff are very friendly and helpful. If you want a party location it's great, if you want a quieter peaceful stay then it's not so great. The bedrooms are quite spacious but the bathrooms are tired - plastic bath curtain!
Shower was over the bath, so it's difficult if you have mobility issues. They did get us a bath mat to stop slipping whilst showering. The gardens are beautiful and well kept. It has a nice swimming pool.
The hotel caters mainly to an Asian clientele so European style breakfasts are very limited.
We stayed during Muslim Bayram so the choices were even more restricted.
The evening entertainment is different djs, but the music is the same with a techno- beat monotony. However, the garden bedrooms are far enough away that you can't hear it.
The hotel is just across the road from the beach. Be prepared to be pestered by beach bars and general traders on the promenade. It gets quite annoying. It's a good surfing beach but if you want to swim you have to be very careful of the surfboarders.
The road in front of the hotel is extremely busy, generally nose to tail, so sitting at the roadside cafes and bars can be noisy with strong petrol smells.
The hotel is close to plenty of bars and restaurants and a huge shopping centre.",I was staying in another hotel and coming to Sea View made me feel so welcome. Dika was extremely hospitable. The girls at the front desk awesome. The house keeping guys did their extra mile.  Great service !. They were so helpful and always doing their best. Highly recommend them. üôèüèº

seems like this is a new hotel because I can still smell the fresh paint through the corridor and our room lol but nothing to be concerned about. I found out at night that the room wasn't soundproof, I can hear people next door casually talking, they didn't raise their voice but I can clearly hear what they were saying. but overall I love the room, nice and clean. I honestly came without high expectation

They got lot of varieties for breakfast, you got assigned to a specific time slot to have a breakfast as their breakfast place was quite small. but the breakfast was great.

the hotel is connected to Beachwalk which is very convenient.

I decided to stay at Yello Hotel again for my next trip to Jakarta after I had a nice experience staying here in Yello Hotel Kuta Beachwalk Bali but apparently the service at Yello Hotel Manggarai Jakarta was horrible. the worst I have ever had.

anyway, thank you for the amazing service from Yello Hotel Kuta Beachwalk team ! keep up the good work","Everything great. Buffet excellent (but no bacon/pork). TV large, clear and has full HBO. Aircon cold. No pool. Enough power outlets (universal).

Only complaint is that the water pressure is not strong and the hot water takes quite some time to become hot.

Room safe just fits a 13‚Äù laptop lengthwise. A 15‚Äù could fit if placed on an angle.

Blackout curtains effective.

Hotel is in the Beachwalk Mall. Before 10am you‚Äôll need to walk along a long driveway to exit the complex. Unlimited drinking water!

Upon return, select ‚ÄúAloft Hotel‚Äù as your destination in the Grab/GoCar apps as both apps suggest an earlier incorrect drop off for your hotel.","Location of the hotel is good, within beachwalk shopping centre. Staff always polite and smiling. Room is really clean and bright. The only downside is aircon is centralised & not adjustable as part of their sustainability efforts (avg temp: 25 deg), so it is really warm for us.","Don't be judgemental about it being a 3-star hotel, I stayed here yesterday and it was great. Quality of rooms, beds & pillows were soft and comfy. Importantly it was clean. The toilet was as though it's brand new. Shower had unlimited hot water with a good shower head and liquid shampoo/soap were provided. Breakfast was worth paying for while booking hotel as it was served with such a variety of dishes, my favorite was omelette fried rice, soooo tasty. Staff was plentiful attending to your table anytime when needed and glances at you every 2min intervals in case you needed anything!

Service was amazing from the start till the end. Extremely polite staff. Even the staff with tattoos gave u a huge smile greeting you ""YELLO! GOOD MORNING, HOW ARE YOU?""

The location was excellent as it's right in the mall itself. Huge Mall which can't be shopped within a day. Great brands and food! The best part is that you can head to the 3rd floor sunset lounge to watch the sun set behind the ocean with beautiful coconut trees in view. Amazing sight.","Great hotel in a great location. Great for surfers since it is right by the beach where many surf shops are located

Just be prepared for high traffic when booking transport since it is right next to the very busy mall."

staff are helpful to arrange taxi to the airport
also quick responce upon our request of hair dryer.

air-conditioning is a bit weak somehow","Rooms are nice, but had a really bad smell coming from the bathroom, even opening the doors didn‚Äôt get rid of it. The location itself is good, but I wish I read the reviews on the noise coming from a nearby bar which has a live band on every night. Usually I‚Äôm not a light sleeper but how loud the band play is ridiculous. Rang reception they told us it would be off by 11pm, still past midnight it wasn‚Äôt off so had to move rooms which was quieter but could still hear them until early hours. Usually this wouldn‚Äôt have been a big issue as I‚Äôd just power through but we had a flight the next day and wanted to get a good nights sleep. I‚Äôve attached videos of how loud it actually was in the room, with every door and window shut. The staff were nice and I know it‚Äôs not the hotels or staff‚Äôs fault being so close to a live bar, which is a shame because the hotel itself is a nice place, just let down by the location.","Hotel is in great location beds very comfortable but wouldn't stay here again as rooms have no outdoor seating area, I paid extra for pool access room with no where to sit. Was also bunch of European girls who really need to learn that wearing skimpy swimwear with everything on display is really not appropriate nor is holding there daily workout routine in the reception area.","We had an OK stay here. It‚Äôs certainly not a bad place, but I think that you might be able to find better if you plan ahead and things are not full.

The room included everything we needed, but it‚Äôs a little bit tight. For instance, the door to open the room nearly touches the wall when it swings open. And the shower doesn‚Äôt have a door, so it kind of gets the bathroom all wet.

One annoying thing is that, even though they don‚Äôt allow smoking over by the breakfast sitting area, they allow smoking all around the pool, so for us, non-smokers, being in the pool was less enjoyable, because of the smell of cigarettes.

Another thing is that there was loud music each night, maybe not every room would get it, but on our side at room 216, the music played until around 10 or 11 PM and was loud enough to hear the lyrics of every song with the door closed while lying in bed.

One last thing, the service for the front desk was not so friendly, one staff member was more welcoming, the others were not so smiley or helpful.

But, one plus is that there are lots of restaurants nearby, including an amazing Vietnamese restaurant and a good restaurant with great Gado Gado (Yummy yummy is the name of the restaurant) just like a five minute walk away. And the beach is about a 10 or 15 minute walk away. Unfortunately, the beach is very dirty, but that comes with the territory.","A great hotel tucked in Kuta, Bali.  The room is clean, speedy wifi and a friendly staff with great customer service.

The hotel is surrounded by lots of places to eat, American, Asian and others.

It‚Äôs 7-10 minutes walk to the beach.  Recommend, great hotel with affordable price for young people."

It features a rooftop area for guests to enjoy.

Upon arrival, you'll receive a warm welcome from the staff, who will offer you a refreshing cold hand towel and a glass of local Balinese ginger lemongrass drink. The check-in process is quick and straightforward.

Our room offers direct access to the pool, although it's not entirely private as other guests may pass through the pool walkway. However, the convenience of stepping directly into the pool from your room is a definite highlight.

The room is clean and well-equipped with water bottles, essential amenities, hair dryer, bath rope, a coffee machine, and tea bags.

There are a few drawbacks to consider:
1. Turning off the air conditioning may result in cigarette smoke entering the room through the ventilation.

2. The air conditioning unit can be noisy at night, which may disturb light sleepers.

3. It may be beneficial to have signage around the pool reminding guests to maintain basic etiquette, such as no running, jumping, or loud noises, to ensure a peaceful environment for all.","The room was not clean.

The staff said the maid forgot to change the bed sheet That's why I got bites ü§î Wonder that they might not usually change it. ü§¢

Anyways, breakfast was awful. I couldn't eat anything. Even omelette tasted weird. I ended up had yogurt for breakfast everyday

Location was good. Walkable to the beach or the street behind which have many restaurants to explore. But it's far from every tourist attractions, and the traffic was very bad. We wasted most of our time in a day on a car.

Don't recommend at all","Love The Bene Hotel!

Fantastic location! Close to the beach and anything you could need!

The room is clean and comfortable. The breakfast choice is limited but acceptable. The deluxe room has a balcony so it is a plus. However some of the staff is not helpful and used hotel protocol instead being helpful. When we extend another day and ask for a different room the receptionist ask us to bring all of our luggage downstairs although we only move to the adjacent room.
