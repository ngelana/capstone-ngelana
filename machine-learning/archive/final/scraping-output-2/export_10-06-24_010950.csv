Breakfast was always good and had lots of variety.  The pools are great.

My son had a freak accident on the first day. Staff were very quick to respond. They were also very quick to look at what happened, and change things so that it didn‚Äôt happen again. The manager came to see us the next day. And the nurse checked in regularly as well. (Honestly, my son was fine. He was running and jumping around an hour later.)  The staff were all very professional, and even more so, genuinely caring.

Really enjoyed our holiday. Will 100% stay here again next time we‚Äôre in Bali.","Rooms were nice enough, clean and neat. Comfy beds. Nice roomy balcony. Service was a bit lacking, we had to ask a few times for fresh towels and toilet paper but very friendly staff at least. Location is fantastic, in the heart of Legian and can walk everywhere. Excellent buffet breakfast!! That bit is 5 stars for sure.","Great hotel, clean rooms, friendly staff, very helpful. Separate pool for children so the main pool upstairs was always quiet and relaxing. Great spa , very reasonable prices and the massages were fantastic. Staff always went out of their way. Breakfast was average, but that‚Äôs the only thing.",Perfect hotel in a perfect location. We staying in one of the private pool rooms and it was idyllic. The rooms are quiet with little outside noise. The food is wonderful. And the French manager brings the Ftench style into the hotel. Love it and will be returning,"Rooms are a bit dated but very clean and the aircon was great! The Staff are awesome and so friendly with a smile always üòÅ Breakfast is good. The egg station was fantastic. . It would do with a little more options. Some things were a bit stale (pastries)
Rooftop bar and pool were quiet which was relaxing. And the drinks were nice and cold.
We had dinner one night which was nice food but a little more expensive than other local options. The next dinner we had was awesome and very reasonable. A Balinese buffet. Very centrally located. Not far from the beach and Seminyak. We would stay again üòä"

Top class service. Top class personnel. Awesome location. Rooms were a bit small but at that price and in that location you shouldn't be expecting anything bigger. The toilets were clean. The water pressure and heating were top notch. They have ample space for 2 wheeler parking. They have an OK restaurant which serves breakfast. We had paid breakfast and it was OK. They have an awesome Italian Restaurant downstairs. The food was top notch although a bit on the expensive side. It's called Bella Italia as far as I can recall. The have a wonderful spa but it's almost always booked, so you'll most probably need prior appointment. Everything essential that you may need or think of is a stone's throw away.

If you have requirement of bigger sized rooms then you should avoid this property. Apart from that everything else if good, considering the price and location and service.","We stay here for a night and we love here room was clean and bed very comfy.

Thank you to make our holiday special.üôÇ","Had a pleasant 1-week stay at Grandmas Plus Hotel Legian in May 2024. The hotel itself is well-located among various cafes and restos, close to the beach, several surfing spots, and even the airport. The staff girls and boys are kind and complaisant (big hi to Ira, Thia, and Jumi!). Breakfast is another strong point of Grandmas' - offering a good variety of big and tasty portions (only the juice could be better). The rooms are clean with hot water and daily refilled drinking water. And though they are rather small, simple, and with very average Wi-Fi and soundproofing, they still leave an overall impression of a good bang for the buck for those who do not demand much :) A perfect place to take a breath after the flight and continue discovering the island!","The room and food was amazing value for money. The staff especially wisna, rias and ira were so friendly and welcoming. Wisna taught us how to make cunang sari which was a fun and interesting experience.","Small but compact room, incredible experience, very nice and polite staff. Distance is best to any  single resto, cafe, shop mall, pub, name it.
Airport is within an acceptable distance, less traffic than those in Kuta  beach front. I love the place
Best...is the staff...!!!!!!"

Rooms were large with good water pressure and endless hot water. Location was good in side street off main road. Service was good at checkin but great at breakfast (amazing job breakfast team)

Will stay again.","My partner and I stayed here for 8 days, wouldn‚Äôt go back as there were bugs in the shower / bathroom hasn‚Äôt been updated in quite some time. When it rained the roof was leaking and it was sinking in a bit out in the hallway. When I asked if we could use a shower towel, as we had used them twice they said no. The pool doesn‚Äôt look like it gets cleaned so we hardly swam in it and definitely did not put our heads in. I asked if we could have cleaned fresh sheets on our 6th day and they said yes but they clearly weren‚Äôt clean. When we had the silence day our wifi didn‚Äôt work in our rooms nor did the tv so we didn‚Äôt have much to do. The buffet that they had for us didn‚Äôt have much fruit which was disappointing. They should have an area where you‚Äôre allowed to smoke outside as when we were sitting out there we were breathing in cigarettes. The shower also smelt every time we turned it on to have one.  The towels also smelt funky. They also should have signs up for people with children to be quiet in the mornings as everyone was trying to sleep. Just all and all would not recommend staying here. Location is not the best either.","room was claustrophobic, with a strong smell of cleaning detergent. i wanted to open the windows to let it air but only one window opens and just barely a finger‚Äôs crack.

the whole hotel is dark and dingy and there isn‚Äôt really a place to sit and chill that isn‚Äôt in front of the receptionists.

not how i wanted to spend my last day in bali. pics are deceiving!
only good thing is that the room was clean, i‚Äôll give them that","Good budget hotel in legian. Great location.
Staff are friendly and polite.
Downfall - Bathroom was small and walls are thin so you would hear people in the next room.

For the price we paid, I'd give it 4 star.","Absolutely disgusted with this hotel.  Arranged through the hotel for airport pickup with two cars, one with a baby seat, cars arrived neither had a baby seat.  The car I travelled in with two family members arrived at the hotel in approximately 30 minutes. The other car arrived over an hour later with two more adults and two children, one 18 months old without a baby seat, in a distressed state. On arrival we were required to pay for our rooms prior to sighting them.  The rooms were disgusting with black mould, dirt and hair around the furniture as well as a horrible smell.  We immediately went back to reception and requested our money back as the rooms were unsuitable and mis represented in advertising.  Two of the children suffer allergies & one of the adults is an asthmatic and allergic to mould. Reception stated they could not cancel the transaction (which was still pending with the bank) and we would have to be refunded by Expedia.  After explaining to reception that they just took the money from my account and not Expedia they still refused. On arrival back to Australia we contacted Expedia who stated the hotel would need to refund the money.  Expedia contacted the hotel on our behalf but they still refused to refund the cost of the three rooms with breakfast.  I would not recommend this filthy hotel with incompetent staff to anyone.  Stay away from it.  Management states they have sent me a private message..they have not.  I will continue to write my reviews on this horrendous management until they refund the money for our rooms which were not stayed in"

The lounge is very luxurious and food was delicious. Roof to Swimming pool was very nice. The location of the hotel is just 100 m away from the Legian Main road making easy access. The beach also in walking distance. It‚Äôs a guest friendly hotel, highly recommend to stay here","We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff service was excellent. Rooms were clean and were tended  to whenever we were out about exploring Bali. The views from our rooms weren't that great but luckily we were on the same floor as the pool and dining area. The only thing I think can be improved is to provide a shower with adjustable spray head. Overall an excellent place to stay nearby shops and the beach, bike rentals, restaurants and bars.","I've stayed at Solia Legian twice now. This hotel was great value for money.

Whilst the rooms were fairly basic, the bed was comfy and the rest of the amenities and price made it such good value.

Located just up the road from the really cool, relaxing Legian beach, with plenty of great bars and restaurants in the surrounding area, it is perfectly located.

With outside pools both on the ground floor and on the roof, there was always a sunlounger on one of them. The rooftop lounge had all day sun and had a bar next to one end of the pool for those who wanted a drink whilst cooling down.

The gym is small with very limited equipment.

The price is what makes this place.",This is a review of the hotels bar. They had a very talented musician playing and signing. The staff and service was aces. Very professional and nice bartenders. I had long island ice tea. It was the way it should be. There's a pool table. Normal prices. Very recommended bar.,"Rooms aircon wasn‚Äôt effective. I slept 2nights without using any blanket. Very uncomfortable. Water from hand held shower unit was weak and water sprayed wasn‚Äôt smooth due to aging shower unit.
Breakfast Quality was poor and very limited choices. I won‚Äôt recommend this hotel."

They cleaned my room without my permission and fought for towels count we are two families staying in two rooms and yet they fought about count of towels in each room, never had this horrible experience in any international trip across the world!!!!!!
Very disappointing to see how bali people can be so rude for towels! Will not recommend this hotel does not have a restaurant or a bar or even a balcony, cleaning service is also not good, bathrooms looked same everyday even after cleaning request
Very disappointed
I also never got to talk to manager BILLY about how his staff behaviour towards INDIAN TOURISTS
Very shameful behaviour from housekeeping staff","Pros:
- Maybe because there are many comment about the wifi before now their wifi is the fastest hotel that i stay before (total 3 hotel that i stay).
- the room is quite cozy and there are connecting door to the other room, its safe if the other room didn‚Äôt open it you cant go inside. Its good for family gatherings

Cons:
- The food there is so limited even there are no porridge there. For elderly porridge is one of the most needed in hotel
- i booked 2 rooms, one of the rooms air conditioned is broken, already ask to fix 2-3 times still cant use
- The refrigerator cant be used

Notes:
One of the most recommend hotel even though there are cons i mentioned","Let me just put it in point form.
1. No wardrobe
2. The bathroom water just spill right out from there to the room then out to corridor
3. Switched room but that was even worse. That conditioner had issue.
4. The noice was super loud at night for the non working air conditioner
5. The bedsheet smelled so bad
6. The room smelled funny
7. No proper shower place as the water clogged
8. Their shower item are so limited as they don‚Äôt have shampoo or conditioner
9. Don‚Äôt even have proper space to put our own shampoo as the holder was broken.
10. The food options was limited. You can only eat the food to fill the stomach as it‚Äôs not even nice. Better just get food from outside for breakfast.

Do note that I switched rooms and both also same. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place.","Best deal for price. The room is big and clean. Good location, quiet and near from everywhere.","Decent hotel with a clean pool. Good location in the centre of Kuta. Very near to the Kuta beach and all the happening restaurants and clubs.

Wifi wasn't great and hardly worked, which is a big downside. Tried raising the Wifi issue with the hotel staff, but nothing happened."

Balcony for smokers. Location is great. Walking distance to Kuta Beach. Plenty of mini markets and restaurant around the hotel. Guests can be a bit noisy but room noise insulation is pretty good. I would stay here again. Great job. And say hello to roof top bar and pool attendant. He‚Äôs very nice.","It is a decent and economical hotel. It has 2 pools, including rooftop. There is also a spa and poolside bar. If you are party type and go out every night, then this hotel is in a good location. You can access happening places at kuta and denpasar easily. Kuta Beach is close by... Many shops are close by... you'll not have any inconveniences... except for heavy traffic.

Their live music and events at night are not that great... but you can go to nearby places which are better.

The breakfast menu is standard and good.

Hotel staff are just enough courteous like any other person in Bali... they've innate tourism qualities to make you feel comfortable but not forgo their money as well.","I recently stayed at Champlung Mas and had a wonderful experience. The staff were fantastic, always attentive and friendly, and the food was excellent.

I would like to give a special thanks to Mahadev, who went above and beyond during my stay. I accidentally left my wallet near the pool, and Mahadev found it and promptly returned it to me. When I tried to reward him for his honesty, he graciously declined. His genuine and kind personality truly made my stay memorable.

Thank you, Champlung Mas, for the exceptional service. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area.","Rooms very musty smelling. Had poolside room first night and had to move next day. Aircon was great here. Maybe too cold.
New room on second floor aircon very poor. We had 3 rooms and all the same. Checked filters and they were black with dirt. Told staff and nothing was done. Swimming pool ground floor was very nice. The roof pool needs some shade.","Nice hotel, in good position for beach and bars. Bit dated, even still uses key for the guest rooms not electronic swipe like usually used in modern hotels. During our stay the elevators were playing up on regular basis. But nice stuff were the staff, the location, and the swimming pool on the roof, which was like having heated pool, loved it.
The carvery night left a lot to be desired, the plate they gave us was smaller than the span of my hand, and none of usual carvery stuff, no Yorkshire pudding, no carrots, sprouts peas, but there was baked potato in silver foil. Priced at 130,000 IDR for adult it was overpriced compared to what other local hotels were offering, and if we returned would give it a miss next time.
The breakfast was decent, but charged for fried rice as an extra, which I thought was strange, considering being Indonesian.
Would we go back....yes i think so, due to nice staff, even cleaners were hard working but still pleasant, and did good job. Location was good, and price was reasonable."

Firstly, the hotel appears outdated and poorly maintained. The facilities are in dire need of renovation, and it's evident that the property has seen better days.

During my stay, I encountered several issues with the room. The flush in the bathroom was faulty, causing inconvenience and discomfort. Additionally, the shower was not functioning properly, which made it difficult to enjoy a refreshing bath.

Moreover, the hygiene standards were below par. The pillows in the room were smelly, indicating poor cleanliness and lack of attention to detail in housekeeping.

Overall, my experience at Bliss Surfer Hotel was not  satisfactory. I would not recommend this hotel to others, as the lack of maintenance and hygiene compromises the comfort and enjoyment of the guests' stay.

It's disappointing to learn that Bliss Surfer Hotel resorts to such tactics to boost their positive reviews. Providing free drinks in exchange for favorable ratings on Google undermines the authenticity and reliability of their online reviews.","I stayed with my families here, we booked 5 rooms . It has nice swimming pool and sand area too. The hotel has good service quality, the hotel attendants are very responsive. I love the restaurant! They serve good food and reasonable price even for the room service. The price of special fried rice, room service, only 55k. Fruit platters ordered at the pool side only 25k per plate! They also have ice cream that you can buy for 30k each üòç We can also walk to the Legian Beach, not too far from the hotel. Legian Food Court also nearby. There is also a small restaurant nearby the hotel which sell delicious food, and there is also circle K nearby. The only problem is the small parking area but still manageable. The room can be cleaned very neatly every morning. Definitely a nice place for visitors outside Bali for short stay.","This place has the cleanest room, bed sheets and AC so far in the heart of Kuta. I've been coming here the second time and the service still very good. I think this hotel has a good management I say always keep the bed sheets and the room very clean.

The room quality left something to be desired, falling into the ""average"" category. While it was comfortable, it lacked the modern touch and freshness I expected.

The service was also on par with the room, being classified as ""average."" While the staff was friendly, there were moments where attention to detail and promptness could have been improved.

On a positive note, the environment of the hotel was quite pleasant, earning a ""good"" rating. The surroundings provided a relaxed atmosphere, contributing to a peaceful stay.

When it comes to dining, the food at Legian Paradiso Hotel was a highlight, earning a ""good"" rating. The variety and taste of the meals offered exceeded my expectations.

One notable advantage is the hotel's convenient location, as it is within walking distance to local shops. This proved to be a significant plus for exploring the area without the need for transportation.

However, it's worth mentioning that the hotel shows signs of aging with no recent renovations. This aspect might affect the overall appeal for those seeking a more contemporary stay.

In conclusion, Legian Paradiso Hotel offers a mixed experience. If you prioritize a great location and good food over modern accommodations, it could be a suitable choice. However, for those seeking a more updated and polished stay, it might be worth exploring other options.","Absolutely beautiful.  Staff was very kind and attentive.

- I had trouble storing my insulin supplies at first because there is no mini refrigerator in the room and when I asked the receptionists they said they only have freezer, it tooks sometimes to finally make them said that they do have mini refrigerator but we have to pay extra 50k per night‚Ä¶I had no problem at all for paying, but they should have told me from the beginning. This is very bad service because this is BALI, and not in the remote area, I had no problem at all in other hotels in small cities prior to this one.
- the parking lot can‚Äôt accommodate the guest cars, luckily the security guard was helpful.
- You can‚Äôt order anything, not even coffee or tea so you will have problems if you have friends coming to meet you here.

Location wise, this place is near to the beach, only walking distance and some convenient stores.

I wouldn‚Äôt come to this place again unless it has been upgraded, so I also don‚Äôt recommend visitors from out of town to stay here unless you don‚Äôt have any other choices."

For the taste, honestly this is really good with the fries already included in the price of burgers. But we quite dissapointed, because there's no bacon in the both of the burgers.

They serve amazingly delicious burgers, refreshing beers, and provide awesome customer service, staffs are super friendly.

The buns are perfect, the meat is juicy, the sauce is yummm. What's even better is that they treat both locals and tourists equally, which I really appreciate. Even though there might be a waiting list, it's definitely worth it.",Best burger joint in kuta hands down...great service...lovely decor...clean...fast service...Best value by far..if you like burgers this place is a must,"One of the best burger place in town, the burger sooooo juicy that the juice is dripping ü§§ with additional fries the price is worth it, in fact it's quite cheap.

It was incredibly clean and tidy and staff were wonderful and very helpful.
The hotel is a quick walk from shops, restaurants and the beach.
The Tuesday night drag show was so fun.
The breakfast had plenty of options and ran until 10:30 which was great for when you want to sleep in a little.
If you have time definitely book in with the spa!
Will definitely stay here again!","The BEST Hotel with the most amazing staff in ASIA
After an exhaustive time going through Bali customs ect, We finally got a taxi to The Magani Hotel & Spa, checked in, were welcomed with a cocktail, cold towels, big smiles from staff who were amazing, guests looked happy-hungover.
The Hotel was glowing with a positive vibe and energy. And to our complete shock we received an upgrade to an ‚ÄúExecutive Spa suite‚Äù which was the size of a tennis court or nearly.
We had a knock on the door and there was a birthday cake for my wife with two plates, amazing. We spent the day at the pool with a couple of drinks and some lunch, followed by dinner with yet another Birthday Cake with the band, staff and guests singing happy birthday to my wife.

I have travelled all over the world, I‚Äôve worked in some of Europe‚Äôs top Hotels
I can honestly say that The Magani is one of the best hotels I personally have ever stayed in, Staff were totally amazing, I noticed them having training sessions some of the days, spoke good if not perfect English, even the Security and maintenance staff smiled, were courteous and so friendly.
I note we had an issue with the Balcony door and as we were leaving the Maintenance person arrived and called security to make sure the room was secured and witnessed, never seen this before. Again great service
On the inevitable last day, lunchtime check-out our bags were secured and we were offered to stay at the pool all day and then shower and change in the Spa area
The Hotel was impeccably clean, Pool was fun, full of friendly colourful characters and they had nightly entertainment with well-priced food and drinks.
I could rave on, but overall, The Magani Hotel/Staff are exceptional, the hotel is spotless and maintain very high standards at all levels at a very reasonable price.

Highly, highly recommend this hotel and big thanks to ALL the staff","My recent stay at Magani Hotel Legian was truly exceptional. The attentive staff greeted me warmly upon arrival, setting the tone for a fantastic experience. The modern d√©cor created an inviting atmosphere that felt like home.

My room was impeccably clean and spacious, with all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay. The luxurious bed ensured a restful night's sleep after exploring Legian.

During my stay, I had an early scuba diving tour, so I requested breakfast at 6:50 am. The staff graciously accommodated my request with smiles.

The stunning pool area was a highlight, perfect for relaxation. The hotel's central location made exploring Legian effortless, with shops, restaurants, and Legian Beach just a 5-minute walk away.

In summary, my experience at Magani Hotel Legian exceeded expectations. The attentive service, luxurious accommodations, and convenient location made it the perfect choice for my stay in Bali. Can't wait to return!",Location was excellent. We had a room with a plunge pool which was heaven after a day of shopping or doing activities - you‚Äôll be needing it I promise! Staff were lovely and friendly. Breakfast was lovely not so keen on dinner but there are plenty of restaurants in all directions in immediate vicinity of hotel.,"Second time staying at the Magani. Will definitely stay there again. Great size rooms 43sqs, we had a deluxe pool facing room with a  large balcony overlooking the pool. Super friendly and lovely staff. The breakfast variety with coffee options is simply too good. So centrally located and convenient to money changers, medics, shops and restaurants. Definitely recommend and will stay again. Thank you for the birthday surprise! Loved and appreciate it."

I go to my room 317, pillow cases looked dirty, I pulled back cover and the last person's body hair was in the bed. They came changed the sheets, just the bottom one, not sure if it was meant to be grey or white was definitely grey.
No fridge
I had to go to mini mart next door to buy paper cups as there was none in the room.
Safe was broken.
Shower hadn't been cleaned in God knows how long, so I decided to wear my thongs to shower. Paint was peeling off the shower roof.
I had PLEASE CLEAN ME on the door for 3 days with no success.
I asked the cleaner for clean towels, told me to see reception.","Stayed here before many years ago , it used to be a very nice budget boutique hotel.

Need a cheap option this time because arriving midnight. So choose this hotel . Have been reading some negative  reviews here , so I'm prepared for the woest

This hotel is Now a limited amenities hotel. U need to pay RP10K for the towel . The towel smells fresh, but it's already turn from white to brown. So if you're particular, bring your own towel

They also provide kettle and hairdryer upon request. But all 3 kettles I got and exchanged are in bad conditions (heating plate has turn black or thick grey stains on the surface )  so I ended up not using them, did not want to risk my health drinking the water from the kettle  , and the hairdryer provided was only 400w. It's suitable for baby or drying your pubic hair, lol. If you have thick, long hair, it will probably take 1 hour to dry the hair .

The bed is comfortable,  AC is cold , wifi is strong, and the shower is reasonable pressure with stable hot water supply.  Walls paper starting to peel off , wall has  mould , building lift not working etc

It is such a pity that the conditions of the hotel has been worsened after the pandemic and the management are not putting any effort maintaining it . Staff are really friendly and accommodating but they can't help much to solve the problem

I still recommend this hotel if you need a budget option in between kuta / Legian area  . If  you dont mind bringing your own towel, kettle, and hairdryer if that's important during your stay",This isy 3 time stay here.

The Penang curry is a must get! Tom yum was good too! They serve a very good young coconut! I wish they have more choices on the menu.","Possibly the best restaurant I've eaten at, so far in Bali. Excellent, traditional cooking and service.

I went for the mixed starters (for two) and the Kao Pad Krapow (fried rice) as a main. I literally cannot speak highly enough of the presentation, portions and taste of the food I ate here.

The chicken satay and peanut sauce in the starter was definitely the best I've tasted in Bali.

All the staff were very friendly and helpful, without being intrusive.

The background music was just right. The only reason why I had the atmosphere as 4 stars is because I was the only one in the restaurant when I arrived at 4pm. A few more people arrived before I left.

Well located on the main road down to Legian beach.

At 215,000 IDR (¬£11), including a sparking water, I think this is excellent value.

Whilst I try and go to different restaurants each day, I've no doubt I will return here very soon. And probably more than once!",Iluh is the best. She is very lovely.

*It's worth your money, located at walkable distance from the Legian-Kuta beach which has splendid sunrise and sunsets.
*The place was described accurately, it has good internet, comfortable bed, the lane has lots of food and party options.
*The host Mr. Muliadi is very courteous and professional, he will treat you well. In my case he agreed for a late check out as my flight got delayed. True gentleman.
*The Air-conditioning was just perfect, seemed like brand new unit and worked like a charm and reception was also manned 24x7.

Cons
*The rooms are not new and have a bit of moist walls but they are very clean and for the price in this location deemed worth.
*There is no window/direct sunlight in the one I stayed, again worth the price.

We arrived at 11.30 am, and some foods not avaliable because of the long preparation.

So we ordered 3 meals :

the best omelette (omelette with beef bacon, mushrooms, cheese and truffle oils) with horenzo salad and cherry tomatoes and 2 slices of sourdough bread.
The omelette is fluffy, smells and taste yummy.

Breakfast croissant with pork ham and sunny side up egg with salad and home made tomato sauce, the croissant is buttery and lil bit crunchy and it goes very well with the tomato sauce.

Fried chicken on toast
1 slice of Brioche and tar tar sauce with chopped lettuce with fried chicken and poach egg in Hollandaise sauce.
The chicken is crispy outside but moist inside, and the seasoned very well.
The brioche is tasted good.

I ordered slushy lemon and mint, its sour and refreshing. Nice combination with the chicken.

A must-visit place for all avocado lovers, like myself.

Staff are friendly, the atmosphere is relaxing, and the avocado toast with sun-dried tomato and eggs is always perfect.

Tagliatelle pesto was good too, topped with a whole batch of sliced fresh avocados. The pasta was slightly soggy this time, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind giving it another try.
