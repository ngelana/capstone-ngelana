Strategic location esp for business purposes, close to grocery stores and food vendors. Very recommended!","Stayed here from the end of December 2021 - middle of March 2022. Very grateful that I found this place.

The owner is very nice and friendly, the help is very nice, helpful, and friendly (room is cleaned once a week).
Building is well maintained with modern look, it‚Äôs fancy but still modest.

Room features A modest TV, Aircon, water heater, shower, nice bed, chair, pretty much all the necessities you‚Äôd need.
It also has unique feature which is the rooftop area with gazebo / bale where you can relax and see widely. I usually go up to see whether today‚Äôs sunset is going to be a nice sunset or not haha

Located in the center of Bali (you can easily reach Sanur for a run in the morning, and enjoy sunset around Canggu. Both only take less than 30 minutes by motorbike).

If you‚Äôre moslem, mosque is only 5 minutes walk.

Laundry? The place got washing machine and area to hang and air dry your laundry. Got no time to do it yourself? Plenty choices of laundry service around.

Groceries? Tiara Monang Maning or Dapur Prima is just 5 minutes walk. Lots of convenient store as well.

Food? The place also got its common kitchen or you can order plenty of choices from online food delivery

With the price point and the service, it‚Äôs totally worth it, and I‚Äôd gladly recommend this place.","My home when in Bali, perfect, I loved it, the owner and the employee are super kind and helpful, the rooms are super great, clean, big, good light, huge good bed, great bathroom, and perfect gazebo on the rooftop, I loved it and was sad to leave, super quiet, great view from the roof, very good
Nyaman, bersih, bagus sekali
