Staff is very friendly even the breakfast is amazing. Also, they have varieties of options in food. Rooms are vintage type and beautiful. It is surrounded by greenery which makes more beautiful.","Quick rundown: Excellent service. Staff is top-notch. No complains about food and menu selection. Rooms could use some updating, but nothing major. Wifi is good. Beds are very comfortable. Location is not great but it's not the worst either. Amenities are definitely above average.","A beautiful resort with the most amazing, helpful staff.
We could not have asked for a nicer place to stay.
There is a free shuttle service to the beach daily, pick up and drop off but if that doesn‚Äôt suit it‚Äôs only a short taxi ride $6AUD away.
Would highly recommend","Amazing stay. It really was an experience to just be back here 2nd year. The staff are very well trained, probably the best I had ! Miss elva remember me when i came back here. Most of the staff here recognize me and upgraded me from deluxe premier to studio suite just for complimentery.  Beautiful spa and grounds. The room was so beautiful we didn‚Äôt want to leave the room itself. I would love to go back here. worth the money you pay. They deserve more then 5 star. very loyal staff with good intention. Not like other place , usually they will force guest to write a review 5 star for their rate but turn out disappointing. In this case i really have to rate this stay 6 star, their service and  INTENTION are pure, i feel So welcome here.Will surely visit here again ! Thank you for everything !
Beautiful beautiful beautiful.","Fantastic stay in a 2 bedrooms villa with a private swimming pool for 4 nights, you will have all the privacy to yourself if there is no neighbour staying next to your villa because the upper room can see across the upper room villa. The bathroom is as big as the bedroom area with huge bath tub, rain shower area, WC and double basins area. However, I don't like the smell of the shower gel, shampoo and the conditioner. I am not sure..maybe they are left too long in the stone bottle.

The breakfast is ala-carte menu. You can choose from the menu of 4. I particularly prefer the local Indonesian style - Fried Rice was good. The restaurant/breakfast area is next to the swimming pool. You can choose to have your breakfast in your villa or at the restaurant.

The location is remote and quiet. But you can easily use the app to book for the Blue Bird taxi to come to pick you or ask the help from the hotel front desk. Please don't try to walk back to the villa at night. It is very dark with no street lights. According to the locals, it is dangerous not because of the crime but it is the snake. Along the way from the main road, there is an abandoned resort project on your left, and there is an ongoing resort project on your right."

Kuta Sel., Kabupaten Badung, Bali 80363, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=6418344884011146266,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 8468585,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.6,212,,"We stayed in October for 5 nights. Not our first Aman so we had certain expectations.
The villa was not described as all rooms being totally separate with no internal join - we booked 2 bedrooms for us and our 2 young children. We ended up having to all sleep in one room as it didn't seem safe to have the children sleeping in a room with no connection to ours except by going outdoors by the pool. They should have mentioned this at booking as we gave our children's age.
The room lacked any personality and did not at all feel like an Aman.
Very bare, no local decor, could have been any hotel anywhere.
The villa butler was very attentive - no fault there. The chef was good but only showed us the kids menu the day before we left (?!?).
The best member of staff was the uncle looking after the beach area, he was great with our kids and really helpful. The drive to the beach was not far.
The pool was nice in the villa.
In summary, for the price I wasn't impressed.","First aman and definitely not the last, having your own butler and cook is incredible and the villa was the biggest I've ever seen. Great design in every square metre and it made me not wanting to leave the resort. I just wish it remained the whole Amanusa resort not just the villas but still great.","Villa #1 is the best I have ever stayed at. The service from Eka and Ramli is outstanding, anytime of day they are there for you. The chef Komang is outstanding, he can cook anything (I am a great cook and I was very impressed). The villa itself is gigantic, you can‚Äôt hear anything, it‚Äôs peaceful and spacious, great for a group getaway, or just as a couple like us. We did a cooking class with Suarni and Derni and I learnt so much, they connected so well.","I have never been to a Aman resort before.  Different level of service then anything I remember.  Attention to detail was amazing.  When we got there they had a ginger drink to refresh.  After we finished they explained the features of the room. That all has been done at other resorts, but these guys make you feel like smart for asking the most repetitious question.  Our room had its own pool! Bigger then most hotel shared pools.  Amanusa - I am not worthy!!",Very lovely hotel. Only stopped for a coffee and look through the shops. All of the staff are extremely friendly. The view and pool also look stunning. Shame to hear that Aman will sell the hotel to Rich Carlton in a couple of months.

Stayed here five years ago, enjoyed the stay, came back expecting the same but was extremely run down, i understand covid had a play in that, but the pictures online we're pre covid shots. We booked for 10 nights,  couldn't do it.... so after 2 nights am MOVING OUT!!
The smell of mould in the bedrooms and showers was so over whelming,  the pots and pans we're disgusting and would not cook in them, the tv in the bedrooms didn't work, tv in lounge was not much better, i could go on and on and just letting you know, when we go on holidays we like to walk into clean, cared for accommodation,  you won't find that here.  VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED.
Will never be back!!",,,,
