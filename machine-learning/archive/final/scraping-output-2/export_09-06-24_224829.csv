Sunrise yoga every morning, convenient diving at the house reef/wreck and local destinations. Wonderful communication, made so many friends. Shout out to Veronica, Luba, April, Dita, Gede(diving instructor), and Nyoman for making our stay so memorable. Family friendly with a small playground, koi pond and some games in the main building.",This place is absolutely amazing both in terms of accommodation and diving.  Nearby there is a beautiful coral reef and lots of colorful fish. A 7 minute drive from the Hotel you can explore the 120-meter-long Liberty ship wreck.,Excellent resort with friendly and family atmosphere. You should enjoy local kitchen. And dobt forget to dive or snorcheling at local coral garden or wreck Relax Bali,"We had a good time at this hotel despite the fact that we didn't dive. I think for diving it's a great place. It's right in front of the sea, you have plenty of fish just 5 meters from the hotel. For snorkeling it's also nice. The 2 swimming pools are also a great asset. The restaurant was just ok for us, could do better on the breakfast. The family running the place is very welcoming.","""We chose this diving resort based on the excellent reviews from other families and travelers, and our experience surpassed our expectations. Michaela, our experienced and patient diving instructor, was fantastic with the kids, making the diving lessons enjoyable for them. It was their first time diving, and they absolutely loved it!""
The resort itself is stunning, with well-maintained and pristine surroundings. Everything is kept very clean, creating a pleasant environment for guests. The only downside is its location in the diving area, which limits the variety of nearby restaurants to choose from. Nonetheless, the overall experience at the resort compensates for this minor inconvenience."

The family running the warung is absolutely lovely as well. Warm and welcoming and the mother and daughters cook up a storm! Highly recommended!,"Enak! I had lunch here after Relax Bali refused to serve me because i was staying at a different resort. I had the Nasi Goreng Special, and it was delicious. If you like spice, ask for ""sedikit pedas"" (""a little spicy""), and they'll bring you some delicious (and hot) Balinese peppers). Gedeho and his wife, Komang, couldn't have been nicer.  What a great last lunch on Bali!","Highly recommend the food is really nice. If you want to try and taste authentic Balinese food you must try and visit this restaurant. The owner is accommodating, you will feel at home. We requested food that is not from the menu like tuna with Sambal matah, and the Bebek tutup that is specially cooked with perfection.
They also organise trip and do air bnb.
They make our trip memorable and fun we will most probably come back for more.
They are located in Kubu 3 hours away from the airport but the heart of Bali is near to there.","Amazing place in the middle of nowhere, where you got mostly nothing to do.
Luckily this restaurant exists.

We celebrated 25 years of marriage with a whole pig roast and some bottles of wine.
It was very windy, but we had the most amazing evening!
We even got a dance show and a traditional celebration plate that we did not ask nor paid for. Amazing service we'd never get back home.

Same goes for my 30 year birthday!
Everyone got their food, and for once on this trip it was very hot! Sometimes in Bali we got served almoat cold food, but not at Warung Sari! Thanks üôè
Also, without asking, the owner had made a birthday cake, and put on birthday music! Amazing.
I didn't even pay for the cake. That was a gift from the owner.

Everything is at such good prices! Most of the price was the wine we asked him to get for the dinner.

My deepest recommendation of this place!

Also, at both dinners we got transport back to hotel free of charge, without asking!
Amazing service!

Wish I have had more money to tip.

The place has many offers, from accommodation, transport, food, renting bike, diving, fishing and more! Please use this place so it survives for my next trip to Bali.
They really deserve all the prise!","Great food, lovely people, nice calm environment"

The aircon didn't work at first, but got fixed just the day after. Building is brand new and attached to a family runned restaurant. The food is very delicious (especially the curry)! Gede and his family is always present at the accomodation, constantly asking if you are ok.
