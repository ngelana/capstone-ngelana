Located near rice field, this place offers a fresh scenery which will get better when the sun is going down. No AC since the concept of the building is open air. The chicken rice bowl is nice, the chamomile tea is nice, but the matcha is weak, a little bit too creamy and 'milky' for my own liking. There's also a stage for live music. Overall, a good place to hang out with friends, suitable for people who want to work or study, but please note they often hold a live music performance so you might want to think a little bit more about working here during night.","Suitable for gatherings.
Affordable food & drinks.
Good coffee.
I had kopi susu original (22k) asked no sugar, but it came with sugar, and they replaced it with a new one üëçüèª","coffee shop near from home, spacious space with stage for live music and nuansa aren is the best coffee","Spacious, affordable, one of comfy place for wfc","Come here after work. If you want to find a place where you can ""healing"" from daily routine try this place!  You can enjoy rice field view and music.

Their rosella tea is something. Never simping for Rosella Tea like this before. Sure will comeback.

They have performance sometime. When i first come here they have some drama show and live music. But the last time  they don't have any, even no music is playing in thr background.

I go after to other restaurant to get my food.,"I took a table on the est-side of the restaurant, you will find a playground for kids. It's very comfortable if you bring children","Warung Mina Peguyangan is one of the best local restaurants in Bali.  This restaurant is very famous and there are almost all over Bali.  Warung Mina peguyanagn is located in Peguyangan Kangin Village, North Denpasar, Bali.  This restaurant is very easy to reach because of its very strategic location, not far from Lumintang City Park.  This restaurant is open from 9 am to 10 pm.  At this restaurant there is no entrance fee, but you can buy delicious food and drinks here.  Foods sold are processed from fresh water fish, seafood and other foods.  Gurame fish is one of the most famous icons here, the food sold is relatively cheap.  Here you can also carry out other activities such as holding events, competitions, parties, birthday parties and others because the facilities offered are so complete such as meeting rooms, outdoor stages, a large garden and others.  Besides that, for those of you who bring children here, you don't need to worry because there is a playground for children here.  Here you also have dinner accompanied by music from singers.  Let's visit here",Great spot with nice authentic Indonesian food. Just love it. The place is so unique and lovey made. My favorite Mina Warung!,"I went there on saturday night with my family, and it was so crowded..  I've been waiting long time for my food, but what a pity..  I couldn't found plecing kangkung (sold out) and sup kepala ikan (didn't in the menu again) :(( not too expensive prices,  a lot of menu packages that you can shared..
So far,  this is comfortable place ever."

Super tasty and fresh sea food, we ordered 2 packages, extra clams, and grilled prawns. Subak sauce is the best! Will definitely come again and bring the whole family üëç‚ú®Ô∏è","my favourite seafood place in Bali. plenty of parking and plenty of seating space. the place is calming (the ambience reminds me more of a Sundanese restaurant though), the service is friendly and most importantly the seasoning of seafood is perfection. i went here on a friday for dinner, went back on saturday for lunch. that's how good it is.","Great food, very tasty with a fair price. This restaurant specialized in serving local seafood delicacies. Very familiar among tourist and also often used for family gathering by local citizen. Ussually crowded at lunch time and dinner time. But at weekend mostly crowded from lunch to dinner. Parking space available for about 30 cars. Friendly staff and very helpful. There is also private room available for birthday party or office meeting.","Ordered ""kerang totok"", and "" Paket F"".
The food looks very delicious and appetizing but the taste just so so. Very underseasoned, need more sauce. Squid satay was the worst, very plain. Fish need to be grilled a bit longer because the skin still raw. Kerang totok was ok, because the sauce was generous.
Grilled prawn a lil bit overcooked, its missing the texture. Rice a bit too dry.
For me, a bit pricey if compared to the food. But the ice tea was amazing.
The parking lot is very huge.
The place also nice and cozy.","A family favorite place to eat with a good ambience, the food is delicious with various packages and easy to choose at the right price, besides that we can choose to eat more private at the Lesehan gasebo or at the dining table with chairs, the menu I like the most is grilled prawns.  The parking lot is also very wide, so you don't have to worry about coming by car or motorbike"

Segara bambu did not disappoint at all.  All the dishes we ordered were extremely flavourful and well balanced.  Highly recommend the Singapore crabs and salt and pepper chicken and salt and pepper fish.  The scallops we found slightly overcooked and the cha japchae was not really to our liking, however everything else tasted amazing including the fried fish, baked lobsters and sambal prawns.  Customer service was very efficient and food prices very affordable.  Definitely recommend Segara bambu if you are craving Chinese food in Bali.",Authentic Sundanese restaurant in the middle of Bali is so rare! Flavors were spot on and we loved eating in the 'saung' and feeding the fish with pellets providrd by the restaurant. Highlight was the salted egg shrimp and es durian. Will come back!,"The vibes of this place at night is nice,,, event there are many ppl i still feel comfy...
The taste is good, and a bit pricey,,,
For me its worth,,, a must try cuisine for family dinner.
Ps : i love the bbq pizza and the gurame terbang",Perfect place for family and friends. Cozy and natural place with great ambience and traditional atmosphere. Back to nature with a lots of place to take a pic. I think this is one of get a way place from crowd. Tasting the food deliciously great. Will be back soon.,"The restaurant is comfy. Good design with water sound and fish pool below the gazebo. The lighting is quite ok.
The food recommend is gurame terbang and the shell. The friend squid is not recommend because its too plain. No taste at all.

This place has the best steak dishes like I have never experienced before on Bali.

And besides their amazing food, the service and atmosphere is also of an excellent level. I will definitely have dinner here again and I might even enjoy their pool next time.","The vibe is fantastic, we enjoy it here. The food is delicious!  The chicken thigh steak takes first place. The staff is friendly and helpful. For swimming pool access, they provide a shower room with shampoo and soap in it. Everything was well worth the price. I hope they will soon provide hot water in the shower room!üëçüèª","Hago Beach is a brand new restaurant with a cool beach-style concept that creates a great vibe.

Hago Beach is located inside Subak Restaurant, which can be a bit tricky to find. Once you know this, it's easier to navigate to the restaurant.

The staff are friendly and welcoming, which adds to the overall positive experience.

One thing to note is that there is a minimum spend of about RP.350,000  if you want to sit on a bed or table near the pool.

The food is pretty good overall, with the triple mushroom pizza being particularly noteworthy.

The Caesar salad was a bit plain, lacking in flavour, but still okay.

The Chicken Parmigiana was alright as well. However, the seafood tempura was definitely a standout dish.

Despite being a bit far from everything, it's a great spot to chill out and enjoy the atmosphere.","We noticed this place trough google maps and it's worth it! Very nice restaurant with pool. The food is delicious, the music is perfect and the staff is nice. Agung, one of the staff members took nice pictures from us. Perfect place for a chill day! Also with Kids."
