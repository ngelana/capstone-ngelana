The staff were beyond pleasant and helpful. The landscape was breathtaking and very picturesque. I got to pet and feed most of the animals which they all enjoyed thoroughly. I also had a chance to enjoy a meal at their restaurant and it was just as amazing. I recommend Bali Farm House!,"The place was incredible, and the nature was so vibrant and refreshing. Amazing place to visit, meticulous gardens with places to relax and admire nature. Also you can see, play, feeding their cute animals (Alpaca, Donkey, Pony, etc).
The Barn restaurant was amazing, food very tasty and friendly staffs. Fresh for your enjoyment.","Lovely scenery, fresh air, some cute animals...... you can feed them by buying some food for them and take some pictures inside..... the restaurant is great...... You can trade your coupon there to get discount for your meals and beverages. I think this will be one of crowded destination in 1-2 years ahead. Some spot are still in progress, good environment, good concept, but takes time to make it fully equipped. Well doneüôèüèª‚ò∫Ô∏è","When our guide suggested going to Bali Farm House I was a little hesitant as were on a budget and typically these places cost a lot. But I'm glad to be proven wrong in this case.
We got the family ticket for 2 adults and 2 children which included 200k worth food and beverage voucher. (50k per person). Price definitely worth it!
Our young children were delighted to be this close to farm animals which we have only ever read about before. Ponies, donkeys and alpacas. Then we even met some Australian Emus (a truely special experience for my children who are half Australian by blood but born in Bali). Ostriches, silky chickens and geese were other fun fowl on the farm.
They're building a playground which looks like it will be amazing fun when it's open.
My daughter wanted to ride a pony but unfortunately we got in too late and the pony had already been put away to rest for the afternoon. So if you want a pony ride make sure you ask for that first before feeding time.
The highlight of our visit was our up close and personal with the goats and bunnies. We got a bucket of food each for my children to hand feed the animals (50k for these 2 animals). Truly a most delightful and unforgettable experience in Bali Farm House. The joy and giggles are worth every moment.","Our visit to Bali Farm was absolutely fantastic! From the moment we stepped onto the grounds, we were surrounded by stunning landscapes that took our breath away. It's truly a nature lover's paradise!

One of the highlights of our visit was the opportunity to interact with the animals. Feeding the alpacas, rabbits, horses, and ponies was an unforgettable experience for both kids and teenagers alike. The animals were friendly and well-cared for, which made the experience even more enjoyable.

The staff (especially Padma) were incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about their work. They were always on hand to answer any questions we had and went above and beyond to ensure that we had a memorable visit.

Overall, we had an amazing time at and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun day out in nature. Whether you're a family with kids or a group of friends, there's something for everyone to enjoy here. We can't wait to visit again soon!"

Surprisingly nice local food that satisfy the tastebuds and stomach.

It had been rainy all day and most of the cafes and small restaurants were closed! This place was still opened. The servers were quick to ask if I wanted chicken, pork or both (mix).

I ordered both for take away (bungkus).","The place where I stay , which is bedugul definitely has limited food option. By 4 PM most of the restaurant already close. Too far to go to singaraja (1 hours up the hills) , too far going to ubud especially with traffic.
Even when I came to tepi Buyan which is around 4.45PM , they are about to close.

Not my first option to eat bigul or nasi campur bali, but tepi buyan is the only one open.
Glad though we decided to give a try.
They had the nasi mix pork and chicken, or just pork or just chicken.
Portion are big enough, price very cheap (IDR 25k). Include soup with 1 cut of pork meat.
Love the baby genyol, soggy juicy texture kinda bland, but okay.
Chicken also taste good.
Not so much for the satay though.
Overall, If I ever stay around here again, tepi buyan would be my choice","Great place
