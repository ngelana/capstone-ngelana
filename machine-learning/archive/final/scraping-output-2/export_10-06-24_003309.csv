ChIJyznwU4cJ0i0R40oe-dXVhYs,Pondok Diana,-8.4896946,115.6038932,"Jl. Pantai Perasi, Perasi, Pertima, Kec. Manggis, Kabupaten Karangasem, Bali 80811, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=10053676858158762723,OPERATIONAL,+62 821-4438-6780,,lodging,4.6,58,,"This place is an amazing rural stay, if you wanna get some peace and quietness.
15mn walk from Virgin Beach.
Diana was an excellent host, he took me on an amazing tour and we had a lot of fun!
I highly recommend.","Location is good, 26 min walking to the virgin beach. The young adult girl is nice and responsive and her mother is sweet as the staff around. The rooms need a little improvement for the beds as there are bed bugs and the bathrooms need better structure. The only serious masked issue is the man who runs the place can be disrespectful and invasive, does not know about boundaries and can disrespect solo women, and the place seems to host more men. Not so friendly for female solo travelers as it can be intimidating.

Update after reply: it's interesting to observe how people react so badly when consciousness is not clear... They rather attack, diminish others and create stories... Really hope someday this good consciousness lands in you and you can honor the people around you and respect all. Such a beautiful family and nice people working there deserve a better leader.","Very Simple and Quiet Place but also a good location. Just few Minutes from a Tempel and the Beach away. Very good Breakfeast. The Family is very open and friendly, if you have any questions about what to Visit or the Culture in general, you can ask them anything. Would also recommand to visit the Water Temple in the next bigger village.","We had a room with a big veranda on the second floor. We were going to stay for 3 days and ended up staying a week. The room itself was big, about 30 sqm probably and felt really spacious with a king size bed. It took about 10 minutes to walk to the beach and the road there is mostly shaded by trees, it's a perfect walk. There are also some small shops close by. It's just perfect if you want a quiet place to stay but still close to the beach.
Best of all is the family running the place. Always helpful and caring. Diana, the owner,  always asked us if there was something we needed and gave us rides to money exchange/shop/restaurant. The daughter fixed us breakfast and was also very helpful and caring. It feels a little like visiting distant relatives but you only get the good parts ðŸ˜€","Located in a remote and calm place,
The owners are really kind and helpful, keen for a chat and interested in your whereabouts. Happy to give good suggestions and directions.
Would come back ðŸ’œ"
