My wife and I, seafood enthusiasts, visited for the first time and encountered several issues. Despite our excitement, many items we attempted to order were unavailable. The waiter suggested a package deal that included squid and tuna, which we confirmed were available. However, as dishes were brought out one by one, we realized that key components were missingâ€”specifically, the tuna and squid we had confirmed earlier. After some confusion and a prolonged wait, we were informed that these items were not actually available, yet they had been served without any prior communication. This lack of transparency and disregard for our initial order was extremely disappointing. Additionally, the decision to substitute the missing dishes without consulting us first was unacceptable. It's akin to ordering steak and receiving a sausage without any explanation or consent. While the prices were reasonable and the staff courteous, the experience of not receiving what we had ordered left a sour taste. I would caution others considering dining here to clarify availability thoroughly before placing their orders.",,,,
