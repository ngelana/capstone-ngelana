We went everyday, sometimes only for the desserts, they are so good!! Smoothie bowls are delicious! Try their Kombucha, so cheap and good! Cafe is delicious too. Free water! Can get pretty busy there. We loved the strawberry and apple tarts","We have been staying in Amed for the last few days and have been to Rimba everyday- today for both lunch and dinner! The menu is amazing- there‚Äôs a great range of smoothie bowls, wraps, burgers, paninis, waffles, poke bowls, salads and desserts, and they have a cabinet full of epic sweet treats. Everything we tried was great, and the staff were all super friendly and helpful. The only thing that we noticed was the beers weren‚Äôt super cold, but otherwise amazing. Highly recommend!","Lovely spot with so much attention to the detail! Very beautiful decoration everywhere and super friendly staff!
Their Mister pink smoothie bowl is absolutely the best! So delicious! Also the falafel salad and burgers are great.
Only negative point is that the place gets quite noisy from time to time.","The food is good and the place is beautiful, but if you sit outside the amount of flies around your food is crazy. I ordered the banana pancake and it was good but i had to eat it in 3 minutes because more and more flies were on my plate. So i can‚Äôt say i enjoyed it too much. Also the fan is only directed to a few of the tables and it‚Äôs extremely hot. The black vanilla iced tea is amazing. I ordered another one but they brought me a different taste..","Trendy cafe.

Not everything is delicious, so choose carefully.

Breakfast wrap is terrible, using fake plastic 'cheese' (menu says cheddar, but don't be fooled) and watery iceberg lettuce.

However, the Asian chicken salad is always amazing, safe choice to not be disappointed.

Desserts are pretty good."

Haven't hot water enough.
Even have a drink in minibar.
But main problem is location close to some bar with live music.
It was 11.07 pm, and music was too loud still.
If you will want to go sleep early at 10.00 pm for example, I have bad news for you.","Arrived safe was locked couldn't be fixed till next morning.
Next morning went for breakfast got back someone been though our bags stole 270au from 3 separate  envelopes they took a bit out of each thinking we wouldn't notice.told another couple they went straight up checked there money 150 stolen same time after complaining they denied it till other people had their money stolen this verified our story.
Got our money back  the lady told us we can't write any reviews but people must know .
Staff were rude and in unsympathetic no apologies
Have travelled a lot this was our first case of this happening.We counted our money everyday and have about it as well felt violated and wasted a whole day.. Disappointed as we got a suitcase full of clothing we brought over for the locals.
This won't deter us from returning but will never stay here again..disgusting but will support the local homestays.Think it's a well organized scam and were just lucky my wife organised our money so well or we wouldn't have picked up on it till we left.
BEWARE","Rooftop bar has nice beautiful sunset views. However, the music is a bit too loud. We ordered some vegetarian nachos and they had a weird ketchup&mayo sauce that ruined them all, was not good.

Only downside is the bed, it's not comfortable.
Bed squeaks when u move and the bathroom door makes noise when u close it.
What's more Wednesdays and Saturdays there is live music next door.","The room is adequate, rather small but okay. Aircon works really well. Rooftop area is nice.
Downside : no place to hang your wet clothes and the parking area needs to be managed better by the staff."

First time we had grilled fish where we tried both available catch of the day. The second time we had pizza.
Both time the food was great and really worth the slightly higher price. Additionally we got free water and a complimentary starter of bruschetta. The warung is really to be recommended.","Truly one of the best warungs in Amed. The food is incredible. The service and staff are fantastic.
I would recommend the enak special nasi campur. Absolutely the best Balinese food I have had. Also they do an incredible pizza! I was shocked at how good they do pizza. You could almost be in Italy it's that good.","We booked the Bungalow for four nights, we were really pleased with the location and loved our stay here.

The staff were super accommodating when our aircon stopped working and moved us to another room where we had no problems, it was perfect! For the price you get a nice bed, your own bathroom and some tea and coffee facilities.

It‚Äôs very basic but you get what you pay for. The first bathroom we had had a window up high with netting so kind of open air, then our second bathroom was fully open air just over the shower, it still has a roof but it‚Äôs open. I liked it! I just wanted to mention it here so you won‚Äôt be surprised.

Saved the best for last: WE LOVED Warung Enak - the food is BEAUTIFUL! we ate here every day, the chicken avocado salad is incredible. The home made brown bread is excellent, I had scrambled eggs on toast every morning and it was the best I‚Äôve had. Highly recommend this place for food. The staff are all so lovely and we would go back.","Had the best flavored Nasi Campur but unfortunately, most of the food was cold.  They were very busy and tried their best but they have a limited kitchen and have a difficult time with keeping up.   Because of that, I would only give it 3 stars.    Perhaps if you go on a less busy day, their food would be better.","What a disappointment. I eat here regularly since 2017, but now something has changed. Speaking of prices, they are insane, more expensive than restaurants and hotels in Canggu or Seminyak. Ice tea 35.000, Nasi campur 98.000, and so on. Speaking of it, the worst Nasi campur I‚Äôve eat in 13 years I live in indonesia. Everything was bad, even the basic Tempe manis tasteless and hard. They serve Babi Kecap with bumbu rendang and not using pork belly, what a huge mistake and when we talked with the floor Manager (?) he has no idea what Babi kecap is. Last mention for the table: it has sharp nails in the bottom who scratched the legs of 2 of us. For sure this was the last time we step into this warung."

Delicious ceviche tostadas, excellent quesadillas, and fish tacos that will have you coming back for more.

Happy hour daily from 5-7 and taco Thursdays","Couldn‚Äôt get a better picture of the food because we smashed it all as soon as it arrived. The BEST cheese quesadilla I have ever had. Good quality cheese and tortilla, soft warm and large. They also have this dragonfruit chilli hot sauce that is heaty and flavoursome. Could eat here every day and not get bored",Fantastic Mexican food! Went to Taco Thursday and ate my weight in food. The Baja fish Taco was straight out of Baja Mexico and the chicken and mushroom tacos were great! They all come with a variation of flavors and toppings. Try their homemade hot sauces for an extra kick! Will be going back again.,"This might just be my favourite eatery on earth. We‚Äôve been twice and will have our last lunch there today.

The room in the ground floor in front of the pool was new, very well isolated (so it kept cool inside) and very, very clean and neat. The only thing, some towels had old spots, which was not that pleasant.

Staff is super nice and helpful, and the pool is great! The only down side is that they are building new rooms behind the pool so it can be noisy in the afternoon ( and some construction workers were looking too much to women in the pool, which felt a bit uncomfortable‚Ä¶).

The included breakfast was very good, and there is also an affordable gelato store with many flavors run by the hotel.","Our first time in the Amed area, like almost all the other travelers that stayed around this area, we came to dive. The hotel was so accommodating we checked in quite late at around 10pm. There was also breakfast provided everyday, while not super extensive there was just enough variety. Every morning we had coffee, fresh fruit juice, a choice of our main breakfast and a fruit bowl if we wanted. We could get it delivered to our villa or eat out at front. It was nice that we got our own villa too. The hotel was so kind and hospitable I actually left my charger and only realized when I already checked in to my Kuta hotel. I contacted the admins at Oasis through Whatsapp and they were so kind as to organize someone to deliver my charger the next morning (keep in mind transport on the scooter was approximately 4 hours so the man left at 5am in the morning).

We stayed 3 nights at La Bila resort and were lucky to meet the owner Katut. Katut is very hospitable and friendly and helped us with loads of information and fast reply‚Äôs. We had a great time, everyone was extremely friendly. Room was clean and the AC worked great. Perfect for us as we were primarily diving. Katut also hqs a taxi company and helped us with our transportation from Ubud to Amed for a very favorable price when it suited us. We dove with their dive shop and here we met the dive shop owner Pascal.
We dove 4 times in 2 days, first day with Pascal and second day with a local DM Kadek.
We are dive Instructors ourselves so we wanted to dive very specific dives. These needs were met and we had great dives to the USS Liberty and other great dive sites, including a secret location ü§´
For a great price Pascal also brought a camera and took great photos of us and the marine life!
We got thorough briefings and the safety standards were very good, dives guides knew the sites like the back of their hand.
All is shore diving but we hardly carried anything ourselves and our guides were very observant and had great eyes. The dive shop also has nitrox and I recommend doing all dives on nitrox. Highly recommend both dive shop and accommodation!
(Summary of a little of the thing we saw - nudiebranches, scorpion fish, sea horses, healthy reef, stunning wrecks, loads of fish and a ton of other great things)","We were staying for Nyepi at La Bila. I gotta say, this has to be the best service a budget resort can offer. The owner made sure the staff covered our needs during Nyepi; fresh water, hot shower, breakfast, lunch, and dinner (lunch and dinner were additional service). The staff went out his way to provide nice meal and homey ambiance.

They're not going to overcharge you for renting diving or snorkeling equipments. Matter of fact, the renting price is quite cheap (snorkeling goggles @30.000Rupiah each). We were let to stay over the checkout time because it was raining.

10/10 recommend üòÑüëç.","It's not beach view. Rooms were not maintained properly. Cot is broken. No hand shower in toilet. Paints were peeled from the wall. Worst rooms I have stayed in Bali.

The owner of the resort (Bungalows, Restaurant...) Ketut really is a good soul, as are his family and employees. The manager of the diving activities, Pascal, is a reliable, supportive and funny guy. Everybody was always friendly, helpful and caring. My instructor Diane was organized, patient and attentive so that I always had the feeling that the pace of learning, exploring, repeating and just having fun was perfectly matched to my needs/wants. Diane always made an effort after diving to help you log your dives and to take time talking about the things you saw under water. La Bila Dive Resort was perfect to learn diving and to experience the phenomenal diving spots in the Amed region - USAT Liberty Wreck, bioluminescent Plankton in a night dive, so many different organisms...

You get to customize your menu by choosing 3 of 5 options. We learned new ingredients and the traditional methods of making dishes from scratch. The food was absolutely delicious!","Do not miss this place if in Amed!
A lovely lady owner made me feel most welcomed. Very reasonable price for lobster and it's fresh from a lobster farm next door. She took me to the farm to pick and even catch my own lobster! You'll have options between sauces and sides.
Delicious and really nice experience!","Really great experience learning Balinese cooking with Kadek. Great selection of food to choose to cook, fresh ingredients and a fun time. If you have time add this to your Amed to do list.","Very nice food for a good price right near our homestay. Delicious, but empty and quiet during dinner time which made the atmosphere a bit boring.","Amazing experience !! You can order lobster before noon, and they will ask the lobster farm (that's 50m away) to go get them for the evening. You can even go yourself with the divers to see them catching your lobster. Can't be any fresher !! The evening, they will grill your lobster on the BBQ and make some indonesian sauce to go with them !! The owner is so sweet !! We really recommend this place ! Incredible lobster cooking !"

We stayed two nights in the beach front duplex bungalow No 4. Its a separate building (as is the No 3) and about 5m from the beach, 10m from the sea. Staff are very helpful and dare I say it, efficient. Probably one of the best places along the beach, even though the roosters and dogs are never far, but I am extremely noise sensitive. Staff even reminded the fishermen next door to keep it quite at night, as they celebrated their catch.","Absolutely amazing - it really is a beachfront property with a kind and fabulous team.
Rooms are spacious, tidy and very clean. Good WiFi.
Rooms are either beachfront or within their beautiful and well-maintained garden.
We had a wonderful stay and wished we could have stayed longer. Totally recommend and we will be back!","The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The location was great as it is closed to all restaurants/bars/mini marts.
The staff was super friendly and the manager helped us with everything we needed (transfer, boat trips, motorbike rental). The BBQ dinner was AMAZING!
I would definitely recommend this place.

Things they can improve though:
The room is quite dark at night but this is quite common in indonesia.
Some repairs need to be done, for example the handles on the main doors were broken.",BBQ guest house is like staying at a 5 star resort but with the privacy of only 4 separate houses. We were treated like we really mattered and they were always there to help. Located on a very quiet stretch of beach,"One of the best BNB¬¥s I stayed at in Bali, perfect house for 4 people. And THE BEST SERVICE we got on our trip so far!
The staff makes you breakfast, serves drinks, helps you plan trips like snorkling and hiking (Mt. Batur) cooks you an amazing dinner wish fresh local fish from the fishermen nearby. Truly amazing, Thank you Kadek and the rest of you Guys!!"

The room was clean and nicely decorated but very small with nowhere to put clothes (only two hooks in the bedroom and three in the bathroom). The staff were very nice and the pool was well maintained. Unfortunately, like others mentioned, there is a patch of land beside the hotel where animals are kept, and the chickens make a lot of noise throughout the early hours of the morning. We also saw a cockroach on our patio when we came back one evening but I'm not sure that they can be avoided in Bali... Finally, although we booked online, the property would only accept cash payment.","We had a good stay of almost 7 weeks in the appartement. Great view on the vulcano and walking distance to the sea. Litteraly only crossing the sea üôèüèº I definitely reccomened this stay. The WiFi is not perfect, but you can work on your own hotspot.","Simple and nice rooms, with TV and fridge. Nice and quiet just back off the main road.
A bit difficult to communicate with staff here, but got to leave our bags early before checkin.
Hot shower was great. However bath tub emptied as quickly as it filled. Breakfast was banana pancakes and orange juice, simple but good.","A small cottage near the beach, with a lovely pool to chill in the afternoon. 10 minutes from the beach, with a great cafe next to it. The host is super kind and helpful. The banana pancakes for breakfast were great! Thanks for everything :)","The service at Mango 5 is out of this world! The owner made a 5+ hour trip to collect us from Ubud at a very reasonable price, he was also incredibly kind to come and help with an issue we had at 11:30pm at night. All the staff are very friendly too! The location is perfect being 1 minute walk from the main beach, close to lots of warungs and shops. Only 20 minutes walk from Jemeluk Beach. I would absolutely stay here again if for nothing else than the room. The very comfortable beds and Netflix on the TV!"

The vegetables and meat were very fresh and prepared perfectly. The service was great and extremely friendly. We will definitely dine hear again during our stay.,We stopped by in the morning for coffee which was awesome. Then we had dinner here too. Grill tuna with balinese sambal was so flavorful. I asked for the spiciest version which is just nice while my husband had pepes which was also yummy. The smoothies was awesome as well,"Not only one of my favorite places to work. The coffee and food is not mind blowing and just okay. Pricing is for that rather a hint expensive.

If you want to enjoy the view you can sit at the top. If that is too hot for you, you can sit at the ground floor.

Very friendly staff. And free water (if you ask for it).

I would wish the food & coffee would be more tasty. Also, a some renovation and fans would be great. Plus, I think their coffee machine is not set up well or the coffee they use is low in quality.

Wifi fast
Power socket outlets 5-7
Quite and a lot of space","Staff are friendly, bent over backwards to help us out during our stay. Lovely rooftop, with great sunset view of the mountain. Good latte and nice ambience.

Edit: returned for a second time and ordered an Oreo smoothie which I finished in about 4 seconds flat because it was so delicious."

Try the Pepesikan. This meal is amazing !","Absolutely amazing food. Restaurant owned by a family and making beautiful food.  We eat here everyday when we stayed in Amed. Have to wait , but everything made freshly.  Highly recommended","I came here for coffee two days and ate dinner here one day.    Their coffee is very good and I really like the family that runs this place.

I had their ikan pepes for dinner and while it was different from the ones that I had in Nusa Lembognan, it was flavorful.   I found their prices to be in line, if not a little bit cheaper than other places within Amed.

I'm glad to support this lovely famiy and hope that they continue to be successful.",Yummy food. Good service. VEGAN MILK AVAILABLE! they are slow with bringing food but it‚Äôs freshly made which is amazing so totally worth it for me. Loved their coffee! Great prices. Super sweet. Saw their 3 kids with 4th on the way so felt amazing supporting this family local business,"The 5 star rating surely match the review of this place. We have came for dinner in two days to this place. Foods are exceptional, very tasty and use the fresh ingredients. The restaurant itself is pretty small, but its located right on the side of the main road and the place also clean. Please make this restaurant of your to go when you're in Amed!"
