Plus, the prices are unbelievably low. Imagine, a plate of rice with two small chicken wings and two small chicken thighs, along with iced tea, only costs 16,000 Rupiah. It's such a great deal, right?

But the thing is, this place is located in a bustling market area, which can be quite chaotic and a bit dirty around it. However, Aya keeps its spot clean. Still, I wouldn't recommend eating there during the daytime because it can get really hot.","Got this for just 16k, im crying! U guys must visited this!!

Sadly, the restaurant is located in a ""disclosed"" / small areas meaning it will be difficult to find the restaurant in public eye sight. It will be better if the restaurant is located near a school or somewhere more open due to the food here being cheap and actually tastes delicious, typical school kids food. Sucks to miss the experience.

Food here is great, it tastes suprisingly good and many options, food here is also cheap. Customer service is semi-fast. The chicken noodle also tastes great especially the dumplings. The tea actually tastes sweet.

Place is also really clean and feels simple, brings good vibe to the area. Design of the area feels modern and simple.

Overall, the food and area here is simple and great. I recommend visiting hear as it can give you more energy to move on with your vacation / journey, the ice cream here also tastes good and refreshing (Based upon another customer review, I my self haven't tasted it yet)"

It's more to middle-up when it comes to prices, start from 55K to 90K for the main courses, 35k for the starters. The drinks start from 35K for a nice coffee (or tea if you prefer decaf) and presented with thoughtful layout. What I had in here is a 75K dish, listed as Cumi Sune Cekuh with rice, sort of lightly grilled squid seasoned with galangal. Tasted so subtle, not too heavy, perfectly cooked squid.

I highly recommend it for you who want to get a nice and enjoyable upscale kind of lunch in the middle of Denpasar, I couldn't think of other else who fit.","Our team frequently visits Bimasakti for internal meetings or meetings with clients.
