- Lack of maintenance as some equipments have broken, lift button, bathroom exhaust fan, shower tap, aircon remote censor, window blind, etc.","The hotel is clean and tidy. The toilet is a little bit dirty especially the brown spot inside the toilet. No heater, no coffee, no tea in the room yet 2 bottles of water. Clean towels. And the breakfast is quiet limited.

The bed was nice, AC was perfect. Clean and comfortable to sleep.

I took around almost 10 mins for checkin and 5mins for check out. The seat for waiting is far from front desk. I'm not really convinient to sit down and go back and forth.

But overall the staffs were pretty friendly."

Check-in, shuttle arrangements, and dining options at the hotel were great.  It is very clean, and we could hear some work being done when we were at the restaurant, but our room was silent.","Good deal
Its a new hotel, so everything here looks brand new.
- Spacious parking lot, valet available
- The staff..., they're all very helpful and kind
- The room..., i say its enough for 2 people.

- Haven't try the food cause we bought room

The only minus here is the location. It is located in the center of Denpasar business district. So you won't find any tourist attraction or comfort food. The only convenient store is circle K which located about 50 meters for the hotel.
If you're in Bali for business travel, i highly recommend this hotel.

Over all, i recommend this hotel for stay. And i will definetly come back to stay at this hotel again in the future","A brand new hotel, good location in the city centre and Easy to varities of food. Except that the room wall is not soundproof that you can hear the noise in the adjacent room. My bathroom also have some design issue on the level of flooring as the higher drainage level causing flood, swimming pool like, haha! Otherwise the Staff service is very good, a minimalist and modern hotel.","My recent stay at this hotel was disappointing and far from the standards one could expect from this establishment. A room which, despite its promise of comfort, was tiny and far from clean. Stains on the sheets and hairs indicating a blatant lack of cleanliness in the room while using the shower, the door seal fell on me, an incident that was not only unpleasant but also indicative of the lack of maintenance of the facilities. In addition, the cleanliness of the bathroom left much to be desired. Added to this, the sound insulation of the rooms was almost non-existent, making my stay even more uncomfortable due to the constant noise. I reported all these issues to reception, hoping that action would be taken to improve my situation. Unfortunately, my request went unanswered, and no effort was made to remedy these inconveniences. This lack of responsiveness and customer service is unacceptable for a hotel that claims to be four stars. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this hotel, because it clearly does not meet the legitimate expectations of its customers.","Super hotel, I recommend it! Very nice hotel with beautiful rooms. Very clean! Big plus for the staff, who are very friendly and attentive. The hotel restaurant is very good. Very well located in the city! For a stay in Denpasar I highly recommend this place!"

The hotel is standard for a three star hotel, the service is great and the food is good. I loved the big room and the small pantry which is quite suitable for families with kids. Some tiny part of the bathroom might need a bit of repair, but overall it is quite clean and acceptable for me. The location is quite strategic, although it is not on the main road, or at the main tourist area, but there are plenty of convenience stores and restaurants within walking distance. I enjoyed my stay there and got the bonus view, since on my way back to the hotel I met these group of kids carrying Ogoh Ogoh and they were heading to Simpang Enam.

I have such a weak spot for Soto Lamongan especially the one who serve it with koya and lime on the side, chef's kiss.

The broth is flavourful and on the savory side, just the way I like it . The portion is just right and they have many condiments to choose from the menu. The price is competitive, but not expensive. Overall they have ticked all the right boxes. Definitely must try.",Lovely this Place. 1st time visiting . Delicious Soto Ayam and not forgetting the grilled chicken dish,Cleanest soto place I've ever been! They sell ayam bakar/goreng too besides soto and the bakar one is a bit spicy.

Driving through Denpasar, being not familiar with the area, I’m always tempted to go for a safe option for lunch which usually a Babi gluing warung. But this time, I had some spare time before my next meeting so I spent a lil time to search through the area and found this grilled seafood warung.

The place was so dead, only one person was there dining isle and I’m pretty sure it was the owner 😅 so I gambled and ordered a meal (PAKET L) which include a grilled whole fish, 6 clams, a few prawns, rice, water spinach and drink! And those things only cost 60k I’m pretty sure. So I added grilled tofu (not kerupuk lol) and then added extra iced tea during my meal. All and all only costed me 75k!! AMAZING! And the food was super yummy too!

Definitely recommend this joint!","The taste of the grilling sauce was quite nice, but there are a couple of things where I've found other reviews to be a tad misleading. Firstly, it's not that cheap; given the size of the fish you get is small in comparison to other places, it's just alright. The produce weren't as fresh and the squid was as hard as an eraser. The place had no exhaust nor an open grilling space so all the smoke gets into the dining area and you'll come out smelling like a grill.","Love the price and the taste, too bad limited parking space"

Noodle taste was okay and the dumplings had more skins than content. They could definitely use more minced meat and the price wasn't exactly cheap here.","Taste is just okay.
