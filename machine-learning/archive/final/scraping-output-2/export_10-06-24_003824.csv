Theres a variety of food and drinks available along the beach. Snorkelling equipment is available also.","The water was ROUGH the weekday afternoon we went. We basically had the place to ourselves bcz everyone was leaving. It still clear out but looked like rain was coming. We were just there to take a quick dip.

We wanted to rest our things on the beach chairs that were out but the people working told us we couldn’t unless we paid. So we just found a washed up tree limb on the beach and put our bags and towels there.

There was a parking lot where we entered the beach. At this entrance there were two or three indoor toilets and two outdoor showers which all smelled like urine.","Really beautiful, clean beach with small waves that are fun to play and swim in. Has an entrance fee. The beach is not too crowded. It is full of restaurants with all types of food. You can pay for a lounge chair or you can just leave your things on the beach for free. Some of the restaurants also provide massages on the beach. Perfect beach for a nice beach day.
Cons: there are some parts inside the water that have rocks and corals so it is possible to get scratched","This beach is bigger then Bias beach, nice one, a lot of boats, I don’t know how to call them:) great for snorkeling:) waves are big but not crazy though. There are restaurants there, and one of the ladies said, they have even a lobster, for pretty affordable as I think price. In the beginning of the place there is showers and toilet with bidet. You also can wash your feet in a special place after beach walk. So, basically this beach is good. We paid 45rup for 3 people for entrance.",Beautiful beach! Not very crowded. The water is so blue and the cliff is so beautiful. But make sure you book your taxi or rent a scooter. Finding a taxi here is so hard.

The view is so pretty; you can see the sea and a small island from the tent opening.

I’d suggest to book the camp first through whatsapp you can search for their instagram. The village manages the camp rental, offering a few options. The medium camp with a spring bed is only 250k, the Dome camp is more pricey around 440k. They provide wifi, electricity, firewood, public bathrooms, and showers. They also have a small warung in case you're hungry or want to buy coffee.

One thing you have to try is watching the sunrise from 5:30 AM- 6:30 AM, the sun is red and very tranquil. See my time-lapse video below. Such a beautiful place & loving the experience.","Very beautiful place and very close to the sea, peaceful place.","Family tent is quite good and less comfort. Bath room quite far from the end vip tent, the faucet water is salty.  Warung's very small and not well organized but they give good n cheap price. When we camp there, its very noise at the night because some people had sing a song loudly. Overall bukit asah have a beautiful and amazing view","We were here when its dry.. so surroundings didn't look really green.. still nice though, great view. You could also go down the Virgin Beach from the same road line.
Entrance fee per July 2020: 5k per person.",Nice place to spend your weekend with nature

The facilities are also complete, clean toilets, sockets are provided, and bonfires. If the night is hot and the wind is very strong. for me the entrance ticket to bring a campervan is very expensive, but it's worth it for the view and experiences you get.","Taman Harmoni Bali or Bukit Asah is a tourist destination that must be visited because it offers a variety of beauty.  Access to Bukit Asah is also easy.  Bukit Asah is a great place to camp and facilities for camping have been provided, if you want to camp, you need to pay 30 thousand per person.  When camping we will be given cables, electric plugs, firewood, chairs and tent lights.  There are also many good places to take photos here.  From Bukit Asah, we will see views of the sea, beaches, hills and whale island.  Here, we will also see many people fishing near the coral reefs.  We can buy various foods and drinks here because there are many stalls and places to eat.  Besides that, Bukit Asah is very close to the white sand beach.  The staff is also friendly.","A very nice place and amazing view,
You can camp, fishing, snorkeling, tracking, and leave all the stress here,
You can build ur own tend, and there’s available so much space to spend ur night,
Enjoy Bukit Asah,
The toilet so clean, the guard helpfull, soo come there and relax.","Great camping spot with friends.
Stay in the dome tent, enough for 4 people, including electricity and fan.
However many mosquitos, so take bug spray with you.
Worth waking up early to watch the sunrise, beutiful views.","You can cal this place ""camp ground"".
They have a lot of tent. So you don't need to bring tent.
A night rate for tent rent are :
IDR 360,000 for exclusive tent ( 4 - 6 pax / tent)
IDR 150,000 for small tent ( 2 - 4 pax / tent)
If you bring your own tent you only pay IDR 30,000/pax .

This place have amazing view. In the morning you can see sun rises. In the night you can see milky way on the sky.
This place face by the sea. So very beautifull.

But if you looking for quite place, i'm not sure this place suitable for you.
A lot of people and they tends to be noisy"

But the waitress brought along a candle which helped a bit.","The food was nice enough. We ordered 2x 600grs fish grilled. They sell by every 400grs standards fixed price , so it was like we bought 3×400grs fish. Nice grilled fish.
Chicken was a bit salty for me.
The king prawns jumbo was informed to us has 4 on the dish. Fresh juices.
Nice green area for resting.
Clean toilet.
Massage ladies walking around asking if you want massage done. Price was 120k for 1 hour. Not too bad.
It was pretty decent and honest place. Price was good compared to other beach front place areas.  (Overall, most restaurants here on Virgin Beach are pretty decent with price.)","Food is amazing! The place is clean with wifi. The boss is a helpful and friendly person. I highly recommend this warung in Virgin Beach.

The food was very good. From Smashed Avo with Egg on Toast to Fajitas to Chicken Burgers all very tasty.
Chef please keep an eye on Burger Buns which were ok but not ultra fresh. Perhaps toast if supply difficult. Also it was a shame no Bananas for desert but these 2 issues were miniscule to the wonderful day and lunch that we enjoyed so much.
Drinks were cold and refreshing as well.
In closing with an unbelievable view thrown in for free the day was simply the best and the bill was to say the least more than reasonable.
