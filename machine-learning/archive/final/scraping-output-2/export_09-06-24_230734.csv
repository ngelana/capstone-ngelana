Baturiti, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82191, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17489076760791149937,OPERATIONAL,+62 813-3705-6767,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.6,278,,"Omg this place is one of the best places we’ve ever stayed at. It has SO many amazing things including attentive, friendly staff, a TWIN WATERFALL, yup directly on the property you can wander down and enjoy the beauty of the waterfalls. The cabins are clean and inviting, the bed was super comfy, the shower was delicious and each villa has its own TV. The breakfast provided was amazing sitting overlooking the well kept property, yummy omelet and pineapple pancakes, my mouth is still watering. We ate dinner at the night market across the street which was a fun experience, cheap and tasty. We would definitely recommend a visit, so close to town yet set out on a beautiful property. Well worth checking out. And it was well priced, such good value!","The location is easy to find. It is located on the main road, but the villa itself might be inside the jungle, it depends on the room that you choose. Walking from reception to the villa can be a little bit far because the area of the property is wide. But there is a car or motorbike access. We booked the family room, The Villa is cleaned, soft bed, and is equipped with a refrigerator, and even a stove if you want to cook. It is worth trying. There is access to go down to the twin waterfall but the road is a little bit slippery, which is good for exercise. the breakfast is basic. There are many food stalls in the market in front of the villa, so you can try local food. also a cafe, and mini-mart in walking distance. The pool is big but the temperature of the water is very cold even in the afternoon. They have hot water with good pressure in the shower.","Clean room and toilet, soft bed, no ac since cold outside, shower only, hot/cold water.
Nice view, also it has beautiful twin waterfall. Steep and wet cement road can cause your car slipped after visit the waterfall","Super cozy cabin styled room, well maintained and quite clean. Hot water (shower only) provided for each cabin, electric kettle ready in the room, hair dryer can be requested from the receptionist
Service is amazing (we requested a food from the cafe 30 mins after last order time but they still willing to help)

No air conditioner - only ceiling fan; which is perfectly fine because it's a cold area

The view from the room is amazing, with a camping/gathering area nearby
The only downsides is the lower cabin is hard to reach by car (you need to go through a winding cliff side road that only fits one car)","I actually have lots of complain but only one thing that I can’t tolerate. The blanket that we got seems has not been change or wash from the previous guest, somehow there’s lipstick stain, and mold on it and also this part (as in the picture) smells like someone’s armpit 🤮"

Nice atmosphere, reasonable prices. There is a parking lot. There are breakfasts. Very tasty coffee! Very clean and comfortable place. You can sit outside and inside. We were very happy to discover this cafe. We will definitely stop by if we are in these parts again.","Both food & drinks were good. One of the best in this part of Bali. Recommend for a stopover here after visiting Ulun Danu or Twin Lakes. Fried banana with toppings, as well as Tauhu Goreng were really good, I liked the oxtail soup, Maggie goreng as well.","Cosy atmosphere with great food. Must recommended place around here. Staff are very helpful and welcoming.

We have ordered Pelalah bowl which is spicy and yum. Pisang Goreng is out of this world, must try!","The service is excellent. The owners and employees go above and beyond to make guests feel comfortable. The food and beverage is also quite good. I spent many hours here avoiding the heavy rain. Eating, drinking, working on my computer. Great place when you're in this part of the island."

Broadly options are wontons and noodle soup either with babi (pork) or ayam (chicken) The wontons are either steamed or fried, I would prefer fried since the steamed option comes dunked in a soup. Also try a local root beer called Badak. All in all I highly recommend this place for a great meal.",Mie djoe djoe saved our afternoon hunger on the way to Bedugul.
