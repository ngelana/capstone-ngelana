Homecooked, extravagant and abundant. Well done!","My husband and I stayed here for three nights and had the most incredibly relaxing and peaceful stay. The rooms are enormous with gorgeous wooden furniture and the views are beautiful, just picturesque jungle as far as the eye can see.

The staff are phenomenal; a Balinese husband and wife who speak very little English but will do absolutely everything to accommodate you, and their lovely daughter whose English is stronger if you get stuck!

I cannot overstate how DELICIOUS the meals were, we couldn’t believe anyone would choose to stay here and not pay for dinner at Villa Wastra. Delicious, home-cooked 3 course meals  which were truly a feast. They catered to my dietary needs as vegetarian and being pregnant, and were so, so kind to us.
(If I could, I would eat those dinners every night for the rest of my life, I’m not even kidding.)

We needed a travel adaptor and they tracked one down for us and when it wasn’t the right one for our Australian plugs their lovely daughter lent us the connector from her phone’s wall-charger so we were able to charge our devices while at the Villa.

The wifi is stronger upstairs than in the room we stayed in but you don’t come to a place like this to spend the whole time on your device anyway so that wasn’t a concern, we just read lots of books and enjoyed the tranquility.

It is isolated and secluded, so don’t expect to be in the heart of the action, but it is absolutely worth it for a peaceful jungle escape. There is no aircon in the rooms but the temperature is much more comfortable due to the building being so large and stone, it is cool inside and they provide fans.

The pool is also very beautiful, I really enjoyed swimming!

So grateful to Villa Wastra. Five stars, highly recommend treating yourself and staying here.","The Villa is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are huge. The breakfast included in the price is delicious. Mariah (the owner) is highly educated woman, a great person to talk with. If you can a massage without having to go to Ubud, you can arrange someone to come to the villa for $150,000 Indonesian Rupiah per hour (approx. US$11). The distance to Ubud is around 40min drive and 20 min to Kintamani. There is no restaurant in the property, however you can pre-order dinner at the property for US$15, trust me you wont regret. The couple who stayed at the property with Mariah is very kind and respectful. If you are looking for a place to relax, I highly recommend Villa Wastra.",Beautiful Villa perched on a valley top surrounded by jungle. Nicely maintained by staff that go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. Nice grounds and pool. Comfortable beds. A little remote and quite for some but this is an attraction for us.,A really nice place for people who are looking for a calm place to relax. The owner have a really nice personality too!!

I suggest you to reach the bridge by motorbike, because no access road for car and you should trekking to reach the bridge. The view was nice, but it just a bridge, no tourist attraction near there.","The bridge is no longer accessible by motorcycle, if you’re very curious to visit ask the locals where it is actually located because it’s confusing. The terrain is not suitable for scooter (unless you’re riding a trail motorcycle) so better park yours at nearby shop and just walk",Not bad to see and instagramable,"I love it, the place was very nice. The view was ok and it's instagramable to your post. But I think now the access to there was difficult because the government was fix the way to go there :)",Secluded tension wood bridge... Needed road construction....
