Bypass Ngurah Rai, Kesiman, Denpasar Selatan, Kota Denpasar, Bali 80237, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=7749393019539907264,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3810-2983,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.3,6023,,"Hello friends üòÅüòÅüòÅ good location opposite sanur üïâÔ∏è,A small corner of nature, at the turn to Sanur, there are butterflies...tickets are $10, if you have kitas 50% off. Not bad stone sculptures...there are no people...There is a cafe on site but it doesn‚Äôt work... the place is not popular, which is a pity",Amazingly well set out and maintained. Lots to see as you wander through well kept grounds.  Butterfly enclosure was lovely. Free coffee tasting included.  Well worth a visit.,"We were bit sceptical if to go there or not. But its very very very nice place also good to do with kids.
It does not have any energy that comes from old temples or old fardens, but its very nice area with many things to find and enjoy. We took the tea / coffee and honey tasting and it was nice to do.
Kids - small kids, can enjoy also tiny ""splash"" water park & you can relax a little.
Very nice thing to do for 2-3h
Price its ok.","We visited (family of 4, children aged 5 and 2.5) in September 2023.

We really enjoyed our visit, the gardens are beautiful, there is plenty for the kids to see and explore and our 5y.o loved the splash park at the back. There is plenty of shade. Definitely recommended.","When I first came here in October 2019, I was in or of the gardens and statues and couldn‚Äôt wait to bring my friends here. Sadly now September 2023 it is a lot different. The entry price has significantly increased and presentation standard has dropped significantly. I understand that with the closure during COVID the gardens wouldn‚Äôt have been attended to like they were previously and they need to bounce back but to be charged more for entry with a lower presentation doesn‚Äôt sit well compared to other gardens we saw during our holiday. Furthermore there was a wedding reception in progress the day we attended, which we weren‚Äôt informed about. Whilst we weren‚Äôt told that we couldn‚Äôt enter those sections of the grounds, we chose not to, as the reception was still in progress and in respect to the bride and groom. Some of the guests were walking around the gardens and wanted to take photos with us, which we participated with and had some fun with them. If we had of been made aware there was a wedding reception in progress, we would have come back a different day so we could have seen all the grounds.
With that said, it is a nice place and hopefully over time the gardens will get back to their former glory.
Previously I rated the grounds 5 out of 5, unfortunately this time it is 3 out of 5. Good luck team and hopefully the gardens return to the former glory."

The place was beautiful and spacious. The Sari Segara fish soup was very refreshing.,"I don‚Äôt know the price‚Ä¶ cause we got this meal through the travel agency. You can taste local meals here, not bad. You know, taste is subjective. Try it by yourself üòö",Best crispy duck ever. Strongly recommended. Rest are also good,"We found this place completely by chance driving to Sanur. It's such a lovely place to have lunch, and the kids loved running about the lawn and playing on the swings. The staff were very charming and friendly. Food portions were very generous as well. We had a really lovely afternoon here."

You just simply gotta visit the place at least once. We ordered so much that day because the food is just that good. 11/10 Hell, I'd give it six stars if that's possible.","Will upgrade to 4* after they improve their fried pork and crackling pork skin, which is kinda hard.
Sambal matah in the picture is upon request, an add on which is not on the menu.
Their lawar has fried shallot more than any lawar i have tried in Bali. Satay is what my husband said ""B ajah"" (B=biasa, meaning so so).
I like their mixed spices they put on top of babi guling, the same spices they use to mix in cassava leaves and papaya leaves.
This place has no aircon, but its cool breeze.",Here With Family for Breakfast.. Good Food... Affordable Price.. Great Ambiance..  Excelent Services.. Family Friendly.. Kids Friendly.. Love to be here again soon ü•∞,"Best suckling pig i ever tried so far. Underated place, come and try.

Csaba",Juice with alot of water. Waiter don't care even when you call them loud they don't. They just playing smartphone. They charge 15 percentage without prior mentioning. Worst restaurant in our 2 month stay in Indonesia,Very yummy!! Lots of seafood to choose from and dishes a little different. Great prices at Segara Mina and very clean. Highly recommend!!
