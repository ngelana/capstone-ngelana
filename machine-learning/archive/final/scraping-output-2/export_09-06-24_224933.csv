The Restaurant Manager is seen around guests and staff and is seen helping provide explanations to guests.  quite satisfying and professional servic","Booked this villa for my family, no regrets. Parents loved the place, the ambience and of course, the restaurant. Food here was top notch, and very generously included both breakfast and dinner everyday during our stay here.

I would suggest that a link bridge be built between the holiday villas and restaurant area for added convenience. It would be nice if the pathway to the villas have more shelter as well.

Unfortunately, there were multiple houseflies around the area, which reduced the comfort of the stay. We didn't open the windows for long as we were afraid the insects would come in. It would be great if insect nets are installed at the toilet windows for better ventilation.

The souvenirs in the gift shop were also expired, which was a disappointment. Otherwise, it would've been a perfect stay.

Nevertheless, we enjoyed ourselves and would not hesitate to come back again if we visit the area.","All stars for Bedugul Asri!

Another beautiful gem to visit in Bedugul. The landscape is super! Resto and the food & drink top!

After taking our lunch at the resto, we took a look to the yard. Lot of plants are there, it's good for kids education.",Taking lunch with friends and it's amazing.

Nice camping cabins with 3 electric sockets in each, smart thinking for multi phone chargers!
DOG FRIENDLY! You can bring your furry friends 😊
It is cool here at night and we found the bedding cover a bit thin, you may want to bring an extra blanket.","This camp has a nice view of Bedugul Lake with hills around it and also very comfortable. You can have a BBQ at night at a reasonable price. VIP rooms has a toilet and hot water inside it, while other rooms use public toilet outside. It better to bring a warm clothes when you come visit, because the wind is very cold at night.","Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this to anyone. It was absolutely NOT a relaxing or peaceful place to stay.

There was a large group of people playing very loud music from 3pm -> 10:40pm, and then again around 1am, and then starting the next day at 6:15am.

I cannot even describe to you how extremely loud and disrespectful it was. If there are rules, then those rules should require signature at check-in, and if a guest does not follow the rules, they should be kicked out.

I can see that there are several reviews saying the same thing, so it seems that the staff simply do not care.

Not only does it ruin our experience, but it is even disrespectful to the people who live here locally.

You MUST control your guests and be more attentive to their needs or you will surely receive more bad reviews.

The room was not very nice, it is not worth the price. It is built from PVC and the hot water did not work. At night we ordered dinner and received some yummy BBQ… It was delicious actually. But the staff never came to clean up our dishes or the BBQ, not even the next day. So in the morning when the loud neighbors woke us up, we went outside and saw all of our dishes and the BBQ were looking yucky and filled with rain.

It is simply not good… I cannot lie in a review. Even though the owner is very kind.

Tonight we are staying at another location further down the road… We can STILL HEAR the loud music coming from glamour glamping.

If you drive further down the road. There are other stays which offer better service, nicer rooms, and all around better experiences for the same price.","The surrounding is nice, just by the lake. In front of the tents there is a pond as well. Just the facilities is not adequate sometimes. Hot water sometimes not working, and tent condition could be better. The staff is very nice though.

First afternoon (with napping toddler) was horrible... so much noise from adjoining room and music blaring all afternoon. Seems to be no sound barrier between rooms.,View was gorgeous but that’s all that’s great about this location. The food was mediocre at best. Everything was very bland and dry except for the skewers. Mango sticky rice was bland and the texture of the rice was wrong. Service was extremely slow even though there was only 2 tables (40 min to get our food). They brought dessert out first before our meals which made no sense as well.

Kabinku is located just infront of Pondanu. Easy access to the lake, It's free if you walk through glamour glamping or pay 25K if you enter through Pondanu cabin.
We tried the standard cabin with breakfast and it was good. Linens were new. TV, kettle, 2 spare pillows, hairdryer.   They even provide indoor 'crocs' sandals that are very helpful since the floors are very cold.
Bathroom is clean, glass ceiling would be great if they were polished. Hot water was stabil.
They have an option of breakfast in the resto, also BBQ package for 150K 2pax. There's also a mini playground and rent bicyle that may be used within the property area.
