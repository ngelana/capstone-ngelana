Beautifully landscaped, surrounded by rice fields with the sounds of water running through the property. Views of Agung from everywhere and sea views from the second story. The staff was so nice and accommodating, they really care about their guests. It is new and very clean. Easy walk to a Warang. Breakfast included with your stay. Beautiful morning walk through rice fields. The pool was great and perfect spot to lounge and enjoy the atmosphere and take in the views. I  highly recommend it and will return.","Very nice modern and clean accommodation with a great breakfast. We also made use of the pool on multiple occasions. Would only recommend staying here if you have a scooter as there isn't much close by. Unfortunately we had to use taxis to get around and the staff were trying to pressure us into using a driver friend of theirs, which made our stay slightly uncomfortable.","Stayed three nights and then extended.  New property with ocean and rice field view.   Very comfortable bed, (slept like a baby) fresh, clean rooms and large bathroom.  Sea breeze wafting through the front door.  I'll be back for sure.  Water Palace and Amlapura only 5 minutes away.
Very quiet and night and staff provided everything you want.  Highly recommended for fussy travellers like me.",The room is beautiful and clean. The furniture is new. There is a nice garden and a big swimming pool. Very friendly staff.,"Amazing sunrise....nice view, comfy bed"
