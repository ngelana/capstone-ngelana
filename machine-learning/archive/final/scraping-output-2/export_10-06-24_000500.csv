The bed is comfy, and the room is so clean.
Me and my friend really enjoyed it. Definitely recommend!!","Nice place to stay. The service is exellence. By sitting near the pool, you can see the night sky full of stars.","The heaven in Bali
This place is hidden gem, almost europian know this places. I really enjoy stay here, the staff really kind and helpfull, the view from our room is increadible, we can sightseeing from the pool to the infinity rice fields.
We also can sightseeing and take a picture in the middle of rice fields with Mount Agung View!!
This hotel also have tour program, balinese cultural and cooking class it was amazing!
I will over and over again to come to hereü§é","The hotel is settled in a beautiful countryside with the Gunung Anung just behind and ricefields all around. The garden is very pretty and the swimming pool too. The stone bungalows are a bit old but very spacious and beautiful. The rooms are clean and small insects are normal in the countryside. The place is quite and the breakfast very good. The service is really good, professional and helpful. The restaurant is good but very overpriced, probably the most expensive we've been here in Bali. The food was simple and well cooked. There is no other option for restaurant for dinner a part to take a taxi to Tirtaganga.",Stayed two nights beautiful hotel rooms were fantastic great pool 60 bucks included breakfast surrounded by rice fields with mt agung in the background you need to pre order lunch dinner and they deliver to your room
