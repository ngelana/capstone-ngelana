Penny and the other staff are fantastic and will go above what you expect.
The meals are prepared very well. There is a security guard after the staff leave.
We were very impressed and will be back in the future.
The villa makes for a very relaxing stay

The only problems we found were

1. The master bedroom shower head doesn't have much pressure which is likely because the shower head leaks a fair bit.
2. It appears to be just slightly overpriced compared to surrounding villas. That being said, even if the prices didn't change I would 100% be back next time I come to Bali","I can say this property is hidden gems in bali. Start from service and views, especially for the staff called ibu Peni, sheâ€™s the best hospitality staff I have ever seen. recommended.","wow, villa bloom is a fantastic place to stay when you go to Bali. we were here in July with our children and we enjoyed it. everything was right: the beautiful house, the beautiful garden with swimming pool and the care of Penny and her staff. we were pampered every day with the most delicious breakfasts, fresh juices and lunches and dinners. in addition, the children loved penny, who took the time to play with them every day. I recommend VillaBloom to everyone. once you get there you don't want to go home anymore.","I've stayed at Villa Bloom more than once with my family. It is definitely my favourite get away location in Bali. The villa is pure serenity, quiet, stunning views, large immaculate gardens with lots of space for kids to run around, a great BBQ area especially good for toasting marshmallows while having a wine and a fun very large pool area over looking the village below.

Penny and the team take care of everything with nothing too much trouble.

We even shared some food with the local people farming the rice paddies near by.

Add in a very visually breath taking scenic drive to get to and from the villa which makes the whole trip a very memorable experience.","My wife and I spent 9 days here recently with our 15 month old son. The pictures do not do this place justice, it is an incredible place with amazing amenities. When we were originally looking for somewhere to go to, we were looking all over the world - we chose this place due to the reviews.

A resort is a resort... what makes this place incredible is the level of customer service and care that was put into our stay by Penny the head chef/villa manager... she is incredible, so friendly and extremely talented in the kitchen. she was also amazing with our son and he really liked her company.

I highly recommend this for a family or romantic holiday resort. The villa had lots of recommendations for activities of which Penny happily arranged/booked for us.

The only negative point I would say, is that it isn't like a full inclusive deal as you would find in a large hotel complex, but still very reasonable with meeting our expectations - it is a very slight negative and didn't have an impact on the over all stay.

Communications with the villa owner was also really good and quick, we had an amazing time.

Thank you!"
