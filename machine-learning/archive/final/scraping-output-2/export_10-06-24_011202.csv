Spacious bathrooms and rooms, very neat and fairly decent sized pool. The staff is very friendly here. Price is very reasonable even for people on tight budget.

The property is clean and they maintain it every morning. Impressed!!

I like the location more as it is far from everything else. Feels secluded and peaceful.",Stayed here for a night. Location is good. Staff are friendly. Don't know their kitchen is operational. They help you to get your food if you need it from outside. Room is spacious and they have a good swimming pool,"We had a wonderful time at Grand Ball Beach!

The staff was extremely friendly and always willing to help whenever we needed anything.

The hotel is very new and modern and the garden is arranged beautifully. They have a big pool area to relax at and give you free towels and water.

The accomodation is directly in front of the beach, thus you have a pool view as well as an ocean view which is wonderful to wake up to every morning.
The rooms are clean and big with huge windows. The bathroom contains everything you need and is very spacious as well.

Altogether we hope to come back very soon!","staff is so lovely and the place is absolutely gorgeous, i would definitely come again with the opportunity!! amazing!!","Beautiful place. Relaxing.
The owner and staff are top-notch.
I'm still here as I've extended my stay.
Pool and ocean view are spectacular.
Sunrise is perfect."

The owner itâ€™s really charming and attentive, youâ€™ll have everything you need here surrounded by nature and with sea views. Itâ€™s a really quiet place and they also make delicious food in their restaurant. Every morning youâ€™ll receive a new breakfast!","Beautiful views at top of a hill. Has a warung across road (not busy) for Breakky, lunch, dinner & more. Loved the chicken curry!! Service was great. Wayan (1st son) was very attentive & willingly to help out where possible. Offers tours to east & west side of Nusa Penida, as well. Scooter hire available.
Short walk down the hill to many other warungs & resorts available to eat & swim!!
Stayed 7 nights, enjoyed the peace & quiet, beautiful views, local farm life. Cottage was clean, large & bathroom was large too. Air-con (push 'powerful' button for more umpth) plenty cold, clean with plenty of towels. Clothes hangers++
TV wasnt working & hadnt for awhile, hopefully fixed by the time you go there!ðŸ˜€
Still hard to see skinny dogs & flea-bitten, but
""Jangles"" the friendly pup was adorable!! Slept outside my door sometimes!!","I had the most wonderful stay at Mesari Cottages! The owner's kindness truly made the experience exceptional. From the moment we arrived, they went above and beyond to ensure we felt welcome and comfortable. The cottages were clean, cozy, and providing a perfect retreat after exploring the island. The owner's local recommendations for places to visit and eat were spot-on, making my trip even more memorable. Mesari Cottages is a hidden gem, and I can't wait to return. Thank you for your warm hospitality!","To Sum it up:
I can definitely recommend this place for people which want to have a quite time.

Long version:
I had an amazing stay at Mesari Cottage on Nusa Penida! The owner and staff were incredibly friendly and supportive, making my experience truly memorable. The cozy cottage was a perfect retreat.
the food could be better but was definitely acceptable. I highly recommend Mesari Cottage to anyone looking for a warm and welcoming place to stay in this beautiful island. Thank you for the wonderful hospitality!","We are lucky to find this at the last minute of booking. As others have reviewed this is a great place to stay. Towels, tissues, room everything is in place and very clean. The only con is it is a little distant from port. But it is not a issue just mentioning so you don't have any surprises. But it is also a pro because it is elevated and you get a really good beach view and beautiful sunset. Perfect for stay. Owner is one of the best people I've ever met. He's so humble and has a great smile. Do try to stay here. It's a great stay with great food."
