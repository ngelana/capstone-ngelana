The people are so welcoming, as are the sweet dogs and Slinky the cat. You can relax or explore the amazing surroundings. Highly recommend the bike tour and waterfall visits. Food is delicious and home cooked. The tap water is fine to drink and so pure. We are missing it already. I would definitely return.","Bali Lush was the break I craved the most on my trip to Bali. Beautiful nature, lovely people and wonderful food. I'd rather not review this place because then I might can keep this place a secret.
My honest opinion is all the stars there are. Give yourselves the experience of going to Bali Lush.","My family and I recently had the pleasure of staying at Bali Lush Accommodation, and it exceeded all my expectations! From the moment I arrived, the owners and their staff took such wonderful care of my family, making us feel truly spoiled.

The homemade food was absolutely amazing, offering a taste of authentic Balinese cuisine that left me wanting more. The rooms were impeccably clean and beautifully decorated in true Bali style, providing a comfortable and relaxing retreat after a day of exploration.

Surrounded by lush rice fields and stunning natural beauty, Bali Lush Accommodation is a haven for those seeking tranquility and rejuvenation. It's definitely a must-stop for anyone visiting Bali.

I highly recommend taking advantage of their guided motorbike tours, led by knowledgeable local guides who showcase the spectacular parts of Bali. From learning about local fruits and trees to soaking in the breathtaking scenery, these tours offer an unforgettable experience that leaves you feeling relaxed and energised.","Outside showering was new to me but really enjoyable and relaxing. The food is good and freshly prepared, trips to enjoy the surroundings can be booked.  Staff and owners are really kind people who wants to make your visit as pleasant as possible","7 STARS. This is heaven! I think batter than that because it’s in the real Balinees lifestyle. The owners and the staff are working together as a team to feel you at home. The place, atmosphere and view are the best. The food is honest and amazing that you don’t need other restaurants (good because there aren’t :-) ) very good for cooking class and walking"

We had trouble finding a ride back to our place but the lokals were so friendly and helped us, we had a long talk with juny, he has a shop nearby and is the friendliest person I have met in Bali. Its a nice place to escape the busy cities of bali and just enjoy nature. The swing is broken however and doesnt work. The locals said its broken since covid. If you are coming because of the swing, don't!!","It was broken, so we could not complete this experience. It was a let down. Please can it be repaired.",Stunning place with no tourist at all.,What was awesome only 25 rubi and the great view over the rice terrace was so unique. This is a must have to visit this place,Often visited by international and local guests
