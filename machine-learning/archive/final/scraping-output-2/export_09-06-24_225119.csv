Only 5 stars for this fast and furious growth,Easy 30 minute hike from the village. Goes up and down a bit but good roads. View is really nice,It is a so picturesque rice field with a beautiful hike with lots of villas and homestay nearby.,"Beautiful place,  great weather. Had a great experience with our local guide booked from the tourist information place (pretty much a garage on a house) in Munduk.",Best rice terraces in Bali. Better than Ubud IMO. Nice walk to see this nice area. You should try it after 17pm. So lovely. Then you can stop in a warung with views and you have the perfect end of the day.

Our spacious bright room was beautifully furnished and super clean, with a nice view from the Balcony. The Host and all of the Staff are super friendly, welcoming and kind. The Restaurant offers very delicious Indonesian and Balinese Dishes with a stunning view over the Hills.

The location is not too remote, so the waterfalls and other sights in the area are within easy walking distance. At the same time, you can escape the hustle and bustle of the main road and enjoy the peace and quiet here, especially in the evening.

It was definitely the best accommodation on our journey so far.","What an incredible place & family!! We loooved this place. The view on their top covering dining floor is amazing- you can see like 180 view :) We were up there for a rain and thunderstorm eating dinner. Epic! We did eat at the hotel like 3-4 times because every thing- like every single thing- that this wife and husband combo cooked was amazing!! And I‚Äôm so so grateful that they took the time to understand my allergies and made such good food for me- vegan and gluten free (with no soy sauce or tauco ‚Äútaucho‚Äù)! Oh my gosh, I could eat this tomato veg friend rice she makes everyday, for multiple meals a day. It all tasted so natural and fresh. The veg soup- simple as it sounds had such a beautiful broth. The coconut curry was so light but beautiful. The Gado Gado they made with extra Tempe and tofu and the cabbage rolls with vegan and gluten free Gado Gado was epic.

Honestly, we love this place. It‚Äôs beautiful- down by the rice paddies hike/walk. We did a big loop from the hotel down that way that was more three hours. But do maybe have another person with you or stick if it turns to night just for the local dogs. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd really touch you but it can be a little much.

They even brought me lak lak from the market and made sure it was made with rice flour! Now I‚Äôm obsessed with lak lak! And gave us mangosteens from his sister‚Äôs place before we left. Their nephew who is a farmer and sooo so nice drive us on toward Mimpi resort to see friends up in the northeast.

The second day we went and hit the three main water falls and did the all trials hike the direction it said to go so we went downhill on the main road once we got there from the hotel and then hiked up. And even added in the final golden waterfall. Def recommend the lak lak (say only rice flour for gluten free) naturally green with pandan leaf and with palm sugar and homemade naturally dark chocolate vegan and gf chocolate sauce. God, I love lak lak now and with the chocolate sauce at the eco cafe by the goldern waterfall _ above the manduk (or coral - that‚Äôs the same waterfall with two names)!!
These waterfalls are great. Good full on hiking day. Took us 5.5 hours from hotel, back to the hotel- stopping at eco cafe toward the end for a much needed coffee and lak lak. We called and ordered more food from our hotel for when we arrived back :) it was just that good. Fresh. Homemade. Simple. But you could taste the flavor.

I honestly think it‚Äôs because they are so sweet and kind. We could instantly tell that when we arrived. And their kids are soooo cute!

We ate breakfast lunch and inner at the hotel and we loved it all! My boyfriend had the *rijstafel* (like rice table) several times and eh loved the Gado Gado and veg soup and veg curry and be nasi goreng too!

So yes, a lot of focus on the food. But the rooms have patios with epic views. Ac. And outdoor bathroom but it‚Äôs all screened in- so that‚Äôs excellent mosquitos wise. Bed was firm but nice. One of the better ones I slept it. King size which is nice if you‚Äôre taller. Weather up there is just nice. If you need to cool off. And hit up some hiking. The forest up there is amazing! The views. Waterfalls. There are other waterfalls further away you can swim in and hike to. You could ask their nephew Made (‚ÄúMadi Herman‚Äù) to drive you- he‚Äôs the coolest :)

Lovely family, beautiful rooms- big enough for yoga and any and all things you‚Äôd want space for- and great food. Off the main road a little ways- incredible views! Exceptional service. The best!!","Amazing hotel! The sheets and rooms are the cleaniest I‚Äôve ever seen probably. The landscapes you see from the window is breathtaking - great location! Also, the stuff is so hospitable and welcoming - they were very nice and kind to us, and helped along and straight away with everything we asked for ‚ù§Ô∏è They also gave us a welcome drink which was very heart-warming of them. Definitely my best recommendations! We‚Äôll come back again ü•∞","Extremely clean. The bedding is fragrant and all the mattresses are new, making for a simply luxurious sleep. Convenient location. The host and staff are incredibly pleasant. There's a delicious caf√© on site. And the view from the window is stunning.","We stayed for 3 nights at the end of December and it was a lovely experience. Everything is very clean, the shower water was hot (and the bathroom view is gorgeous) with a nice balcony overlooking the forest. The family who runs the villa is so helpful and kind. The restaurant is phenomenal, the pork barbeque skewers were to die for. The seating area has a great view. The room doesn't have AC because it's quite a bit cooler in the mountains, you certainly don't need it. The rooms do have small ventilation ports that are screens open to the outside and allow noise in which, means you can hear the chickens pretty clearly in the morning. We've found this to be the case most places we've stayed in Bali so it was not a big deal, but if you're a light sleeper it's something to consider."

We came here on our first day in Munduk and had delicius nagi goreng, we enjoyed the food so much that we came back the day after and did a cooking day and had trditional offering and prey with this amazing family that lives here. The food is very healthy and all ingredients comes from the home garden! These are the most charming people I met in Bali. do not miss!",The owner Ilu was very nice. She showed us around the garden. It had so many types of plants growing. She gave us an avocado and let us try one of the snakeskin fruits that we've never had before. We ordered the banana fritter and it was so good! We ate it hot even though it was burning our mouths. I would recommend buying the cacao with palm sugar. Ilu gave us a sample and we had to get 2 packets as I wanted to finish one during the trip and we needed one to take home.,"Loveliest little place! I was shown around the spice garden and tasted some of the home grown cacao and palm sugar. It is also owned by the kindest family :) They also serve food and drinks, you can even cook with them. Highly recommend stopping by!",I was so lucky to find this place as the owner Ilu (unsure of spelling) was in the driveway attending to her drying coffee beans.  She said hello and then I realised it was a Warung and her home.  I had a lovely ginger coffee made with her own personally roasted beans.  Ilu and her young Daughter were so friendly and showed me the various plants she has and how to get the coffee beans out of the dried fruit.  She has spices etc for sale from her own garden.  This place is a must visit if you are doing the rice field walk.  Beautiful people and the coffee was superb.  I feel bad that I only paid 20k idr but did not have any small money to give a tip.  I wish I had have left 100k as the experience was worth that and more.  Suksma.,Very nice place to make a break on the way to the rice fields. The lime juice is great and they offer fruits from their own plantage. If you have time the owner show you their own big and nice fruit and cacao plantages

The views are amazing, really how one imagines Bali to be. The room is wonderfully appointed, with so much care for detail and, very importantly, a place to work. It's super clean, the mattress is incredibly comfortable and the rain shower such a treat every day.
10 out of 10, would recommend any day. The hosts are such a lovely and open couple. Wish I could have stayed longer.",,,
