Even though there's a popular, cheaper kebab place nearby, we kept coming back because we enjoy the taste. However, today was a bit disappointing. We ordered mixed meat and salad with four sauces (garlic, tomato, BBQ, and mustard). In previous visits, they always asked if we wanted the sauces mixed or separate, but this time they didn't (and damn I forgot to mention also). Our order came with all the sauces mixed on the meat generously. When we mentioned it, they said it was because we didn't ask for them to be separated, which was partially true. I was just thinking if there were these options, they should be trained to ALWAYS ask the guests how they want the sauces served.

The meat tasted unenjoyable with all the sauces, and to make matters worse, the fries were excessively salty. We had to clean them one by one because they were covered in salt. I didn‚Äôt understand why they had the urge to add that much when they actually had salt on the table. If we wanted more, we could just add ourselves. Should have been just sprinkle of it. It was frustrating that they didn't ask or help when they saw the issue.

We finished the meal, paid, but there were no apologies, no smiles, no thank you. It was a memorable experience, but not in a good way.","The best place to eat on Jalan Goa Gong. Their kebabs are pretty good but I prefer their kebab plates. Also, seating is quite limited, most of their orders are for takeout.","This kebab place is a solid choice. The food is tasty, and the service is good. It's a dependable spot to satisfy your cravings for some delicious kebabs. I've enjoyed my visits here and would consider returning.","We were just after something quick, cheap and easy that was near our room... We ended up VERY pleasantly surprised!!

This is probably the worst accomodation experience I have ever had.

Before we even arrived‚Ä¶
We booked through airbnb, the host said we could not stay due to maintenance that would take 1 month, then when confronted by airbnb about refunding us took back what they said so we could not cancel.

Check in‚Ä¶
They completely lied and scammed us. The place was filthy, the pool green with algae. Absolutely disgusting. Whist we were madly trying to rebook accomodation both a cleaner and a pool person turned up agreeing with the place being disgusting.

The manager then called us asking us (2 adults and a baby) to leave the property immediately when we were trying to organise alternate accommodation as it was getting later and later into the evening.
