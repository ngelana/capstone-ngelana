Really loved the positive energy and the radiant smiles I got when interacting with the resort staff.

Only slight complain are the beaches, a lot of seaweed wash up to the shores. Don‚Äôt blame the hotel for this as it must be a pain to clean all of them up every single day.

Anyway, the hotel facilities were great! The spa was awesome!

Highly recommend the daily morning yoga at 6:30am. The botanical garden tour (within the Conrad premises) on Thursday 3pm. Through various plants and trees - a lot of them have symbolic meaning to the locals - you will learn a lot about Balinese culture.

Enjoy!","The Conrad Bali is TRULY a phenomenal resort. Despite being a 20-year old property, the room was extremely modern and spacious after the renovation. However, there were some issues with the door latch as it needed extra force to fully close. There was also a stuffed monkey in the room which we gladly kept as a souvenir.

Service was immaculate as everystaf always kept a smile on their face. Food venues also provided exceptional dishes and played great songs.

Overall, I would definitely visit again in the near future.","People are really friendly and helpful in this resort.
We travelled with two toddlers and they absolutely loved it.
Breakfast buffet is the best part. There is an impressive variety of food, pastries and basically what we like to have.
Pool is massive and literally steps away from a nice beach and right next to water sports which is more suitable for adults.
Rooms are a bit outdated but still clean and nicely renovated.
Streets around the resorts are not stroller friendly. We could only get to 200m away from the resort before we had enough of lifting the stroller over holes and barriers, but if you stay in the resort it is absolutely fine.
Food and spa was a bit expensive in the resort but very tasty.
Overall we loved our experience at this resort and will definitely recommend it.","The Conrad is a stunning hotel. The pools and gardens are beautiful and there was plenty of room to swim despite being a large resort. The staff were super friendly and went out of their way to help. The food was great and the buffet breakfast was delicious. The day spa was lovely and I highly recommend the Mum &  me package. Our suite was spacious and well appointed. The loss of one star was for the beds, they were extremely hard to the point of uncomfortable. Despite all the amazing things about the hotel, I was glad we only had three nights in the end as our sleep was disrupted. Overall, I'd recommend a stay at the Conrad.","Excellent! On the coast of nusa dua, a lovely property which is about 30 min away from the DPS airport. Our pool facing room had the lagoon pool right next to the private balcony. The room was spacious and very clean. The bathroom was big with a good tub and was super clean.

The breakfast spread was excellent and had the right mix of international, local and even Indian cuisine. The local, order from table dishes, were excellent. The restaurant staffs were very helpful.

We had dinner from all their 3 restaurants. In the Indonesian and the Japanese restaurant, the food and service was excellent. But their seafood restaurant was pretty average for both food and service.

The complementary photo session was good. But buying the photos ( apart from the one complementary one) is pretty expensive.

There are activities and water sports in their beach which is conducted by 3rd parties. All those activities were done professionally.

Overall, a great experience for the family, especially for the kids!"

Im the vendor who did the service for their chair. they promised to pay in 1 week. and already more than 2 weeks. they never reply us and only read our message. hello, we are small vendor and you are big hotel. is this your way to  treat us? we work for you and you not pay us at all!!","Had a quite pleasant stay here. The room was clean, pool was clean, ac working well. Breakfast not many variety but not a big problem for me. One tiny suggestion tho, please consider to have separate trash bin for room and bathroom.
Overall, it was a good stay. I'll be back for impromptu visit to Bali.","Not sure what it is about all the five star reviews because this hotel definitely doesn‚Äôt deserve the current 4.6 total stars. There is only one good thing about this hotel, and that is the front desk service. The other aspects are very disappointing, especially the hard products.

This hotel needs a lot of renovation because you can feel it wasn‚Äôt really maintained well during covid. Rusts everywhere in the room and bathroom, sad looking towels, uneven wall painting on the doors and moldy windows and mirrors. An unpleasant smell will greet you when you first entered your room and is likely going to linger throughout your stay.

They were also removing and cleaning a big rusty bar from the awning of the entrance when I was there which in itself is a good thing that they are trying to improve things. But, you can‚Äôt help but wonder why they didn‚Äôt maintain it very well because you can clearly see the hotel is not that old.

Breakfast was also disappointing with minimal real meal served, mostly pre-processed food. Egg station always has long lines.

Thankfully the staff that I encountered during my stay were all helpful and great. Housekeeping staff could do with a bit more smile but nothing too disappointing about the staff.

Overall a less than ideal stay and the current 4.6 stars seem questionable‚Ä¶","A really good bang for buck seaside hotel/resort!
Reception and Service personnel were so helpful 100% of the time, with fast room service and always with such a wonderful demeanour! ‚ù§Ô∏è Ground level pool was always beautiful and clean, as was the roof pool. Food was great, and they always made me a beautiful coffee ‚òïÔ∏è in the morning.
There was really only one bit of a problem, in that there is a severe lack of shade up on the top pool/bar area, which could have a quick fix (cheap until funds become more available) by putting up some shade sails (shade cloth), to ease the sun and heat! Do that, and you'll have a top spot with fantastic views!
A special shout out to Dwiki Purnawan (amongst others), for consistency in his great service, irrespective of what he was doing.
We'll be back (especially if we can have Rm 173? Or was it 143?, near the pool, next to the towel man!) really soon.
Close (like right in front) to some great Ocean amenities, like paragliding, jet skis, you name it!
Thanks, Tijili Benoa üôè for making our Christmas and New Year celebrations  a year to remember!"

Definite 3 star at best.  Think if you can get it cheap it would be OK, especially compared to the expensive flash hotels around thus area  The beach was lovely outside the hotel, but right next to it it's grim. Looked like mud. The bar where I plonked myself next to the beach was very reasonably priced! 35IDR beer, 70 wine. Inclusive of tax etc. Considering the position that's great!  Great views! The staff don't seem happy, just average. Low energy.","We had a really nice time at this resort. The traditional design was simply beautiful and provided a bit more intentional vibe as compared to the larger chain resorts. They have plenty of amenities on the schedule including water sports options at the nearby vendor. Meals were appropriate for this level of hotel with a balanced range of local and Western fare. It is mostly visited by older, Western expats and families so it is a bit quieter pace than some other locations.","We booked sea view room for 2 nights. It‚Äôs was a pleasant stay and we want to appreciate for their service, great and vast varieties in breakfast. Only drawback I felt that even location is next to beach but all other main attractions are quite far from here which took us a lot of time just to reach there.","This hotel so looks elegant when you see from the front or even sits in the lobby, but unfortunately the rooms / bed / bedsheets need upgrade badly. When we checked in, AC wasn‚Äôt working and the room had a smell. Good part is that Pool is nice/big and beach is right in-front but overall this hotel didn‚Äôt meets our expectations."

Also, the food is halal. Overall, I loved the food!

They have outdoor and indoor seating and do party orders as well. It's a well lit place and easily accessible and right on the main street  road of Nusa Dua.","Came here twice during our stay.

Authentic Indian curry.  Most of the diners were Indian.  Good sign that this place is legit.

The curry roti and Naan hit the spot.  Would definitely recommend it!

Only downside is that it is a little on the pricey side.","A wonderful experience, albeit I picked a quieter time, early dinner nonetheless the food was lovely. I chose 2 mains, so a protein and veg dish, garlic naan tasty and flavoursome. Oh, I also treated myself to a Neeta's cocktail. Thank you Ebony and JJ for your hospitality and warm friendly smiles, much appreciated.","The food was good, we had pakoras, butter chicken, and eggplant curry with rice and naan, and two drinks for a total of 400k IDR which was fair.

The staff are kind, friendly and very helpful.  We went to the dining hall for breakfast and had the same waitress from the morning prior.  We placed our orders and when it came to the choice of juice/fresh fruit and tea/coffee (and type of coffee) she recited what we had the morning before and if we wanted the same again.  How many waiters/waitresses can do that upon a 2nd visit?  The only drawback is the side road leading to the hotel and my reason for 4 stars vs 5 in that category.  As a new visitor to Bali, this narrow roadway was a little unnerving.  That said, we‚Äôve walked it several times at all hours of the day and night.  Our concerns of safety have completely vanished.  Random locals sitting at their doors as we walk by are all very quick to offer a smile and a greeting of hello.  The rooms are massive and the private pool/patio and cabana are heavenly!

Rooms are perfect for a little get away and the swimming pool is so nice, we stayed in the deluxe rooms.

The location is great too, a bit of a walk to the beach but definitely not an issue. It‚Äôs a great option to enjoy Nusa dua outside of the huge resorts.

The folks running it are super nice and helpful; the rooms are large and clean; the breakfast is wonderful; and the overall ambience is relaxing. And the price can‚Äôt be beat!","The villa was well presented and the staff were very friendly however that's where the good experience ends
The villa pool and main pools were like a warm bath.
The location was well away from anything down a dodgy laneway with roaming dogs. The area nearby was boring with nothing on offer. Restaurants nearby were expensive.
The included breakfast was limited and tasteless. American breakfast was your choice of bland scrambled eggs or snotty fried eggs with 2 small sausages, 1 cherry tomato cut into quarters, 1 button mushroom cut into quarters and stale toast.
Staff offered to bring our bags to the room at check in but I ended up collecting them myself about half hour later as they were still at reception.","Wanted to highlight the fact that our luggage was stolen from the hotel storage room, there were cameras, but whoever did it avoided them. Management convinced that this incident was reported to the police, but when were asked to provide the report, went silent on WhatsApp, no cooperation. Make your own conclusions.

Would definitely stay here again if I return to Nusa Dua.",I reserved a stay here super last minute and I‚Äôm so happy I did! The hosts are friendly and accommodating! I missed a connection and arrived much later in the night but they were there to greet me with a smile and were responsive and quick when I needed help. The room is clean and very spacious. The pool area is beautiful with the tended garden. Extremely comfortable area to stay at. Loved it for my first time in Bali ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Davit Guest House is a rare gem that accepts Visa payment and met all our expectations for warm friendly bali hospitality, privacy, security, peace and basic requirements; Clean and spacious room with a comfortable king size bed and large TV screen and strong air-conditioning. Clean large bathroom with sink-side power outlet, toilet bidet and rain shower with heater. Our cosy verandah overlooked the pool where we enjoyed a frequent dip or just chilled indulging in local fruits bought along the street just outside of the Guesthouse. Andi who works the desk and rooms is very helpful and accommodating, providing us with extra bath and beach towels when requested. We also rented his cool new scoopy scooter for 75k per day (cash) We strongly recommend this hospitality if you want to take ownership  and turn this modern and naturistic space into a home away from home.",Will for sure stay here again! Super comfortable bed and room! The staff was friendly but not too overbearing which we appreciated! Hot shower and great clean bathroom! Fantastic! Thank you!,"‚Ä¢Probably the best sleep I‚Äôve had the last 6 weeks in Bali, the beds are huge and in great condition, I cannot recommend Davits Guesthouse enough! We stayed 4 nights.

‚Ä¢Great hospitality from the team, when Davit noticed we were in the pool, he turned on the pool filters for us

‚Ä¢The linens are white white

‚Ä¢The rooms are large and spotless

‚Ä¢Clean pool, well maintained

‚Ä¢They have shared kitchen facilities and fridges

‚Ä¢The gardens is well manicured and peaceful

‚Ä¢Fantastic in-house laundry service as well

‚Ä¢A short walk to the main street, the restaurant on the corner is decent

‚Ä¢I highly recommend Davit Guesthouse"

Yes, foods great. In fact, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and yes, desert.

Dine in a cool room or experience the street bussle pass you by. Very comfortable either way.

It's a little more entertaining than just a restaurant. Live music most days. Easy listening. Looking at the patrons mouthing the words. Even a reasonable pool table.

Service and staff are more like a five-star hotel (except quicker). Genuinely friendly and competent.

So fancy a good feed with a menu you can understand. Don't want to wait a lifetime for your meal. Sick of  eating food that doesn't meet the description.

Just go to Meads.

Thank you to the staff and owners for the great experience.

Went back today for another hit with a group of friends. Every bit as good as the first time.

Music was good, too. Better food better people go to Meads.","We have stayed here for a second week now, and today we stopped to eat dinner here...and we can't say anything negative about anything. Owner and service take the place to serve us...with smiling and welcoming. The food was excellent and fulfilling. Fish and chips...for the first time of my life and I wonder if I ever can get better in anywhere. The freshness of that fish ü§§. In Finland you will get that from freezer or pay really a lot of money to get piece of fresh fish. We are really happy to experience this ‚ù§Ô∏è","Definitely recommended to anyone visiting Nusa Dua.. food, hotel pick up, live music, pool table and welcoming staff make this restaurant a perfect choice for any occasion. It was the best customer service we have had in Bali, the staff was amazing, very attentive to anything we needed, the service was fast and the food is absolutely fantastic.
The live music was an amazing addition to our evening. We came celebrating our honeymoon and everyone made sure we felt extra special. Thank you üôèüèº we will be back",Staff were very welcoming and attentive it was like a home from home. Owner introduced himself and said he was on hand if there were any issues which there were none. Food was freshly cooked and plentiful as well as very tasty and well priced.

The towels were never changed, and only one was taken away. Breakfast is free, but the choice is only two dishes and tasteless. I didn‚Äôt like the area either; there are few normal cafes and spas nearby. Better choose another place. I don't recommend it","The mood was spoiled; they didn‚Äôt even want to sort out our problem properly, and didn‚Äôt even offer to look at the cameras from the stairs. And they accused us, justifying it by saying that the Russian people themselves are losing everything and blaming them. On the eve of departure, we packed our things and put the money in a locked bag, but when we checked everything before leaving, it turned out that $100 was missing. Be careful and carry money with you",Very nice stay with family and children. Friendly owner with other staff who prepared a great breakfast. Everything was clean and preparatory. I can definitely recommend. It was a very nice stay where you don't miss anything and the friendly Balinese people are great. Terimakasih!

Had two dinners here and both were so yummy. Tried the garlic rice, sweet and sour squid, calamari, tofu and beans, peppermint tea and the lime/honey drink. All were so great! The sweet and sour was sooo yummy, wish I could eat there all the time.
The service is great too, the staff are really cute and well mannered. The restaurant itself is clean and has nice vibes.
Definitely recommend.","Updated review- now my 5th time here in 3 months and just hits the spot every time

Fresh food and delicious.
Ordered the garlic rice with mandarin chicken which tastes like orange chicken and the koloke chicken which is like a sweet and sour chicken and a order of the crunchy prawns with sweet and sour sauce.
Everything was so hot and fresh and tasted amazing. I‚Äôll be back again for more. I didn‚Äôt get a chance to take photos but I‚Äôll upload it next time I go. It‚Äôs worth a visit! Very good food and service.",Really great local Asian restaurant. Ordered via grab. Could taste the food was cooked fresh before being delivered. It was quick and arrived packaged very well. Everything was still hot and nothing leaked through the boxes. Will definitely order from here again! I had the mandarin chicken which is exactly like an orange chicken. I also got the Koloke chicken which is like a sweet and sour. Highly recommend this place.

The cleanliness of the hostel truly stood out, making for a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. What really made the experience special was the warm welcome I received from the staff.

The owner and staff (all family) are very friendly and helpful in many ways. The room is tidy, has a small kitchen (no cooking area) and the bathroom is totally okay. The pool is small but perfect to cool down or relax.
Nusa Dua itself was not quite my place to be. Too many hotel resorts claiming the beaches‚Ä¶ for a stop over totally fine however! But that‚Äôs just my personal point of view.",Always come here if i want a peaceful vacation. Just across the street then you‚Äôll find a white sand beach. Sunrise is beautiful.

It is set back from the road and super quiet.
The rooms are lovely and the beds are super comfortable. The family and the staff are an absolute delight and the breakfast we were served in the morning was very yummy!
Would happily go back there.","Top GuestHouse in Benoa !
Really friendly staff, nice big room, best omelette breakfast ever !
Nice location to drive around Tanjung Benoa & Nusa Dua !!","Overall we were absolutely delighted with our stay at Puri Clinton Bali!

What they did great:
The homestay's non-pretentious, welcoming concept, managed by Pak Wayan and his family, left us thoroughly impressed.
Great location in Benoa area, opposite 5 star hotels. Less than 5 min walk to the beach front.
A number of nearby eateries (mix of local and international options), convenience stores and many massage spas all along the road means you don't really have to venture far for anything other than exploring the rest of Bali ‚ò∫Ô∏è.
It has the convenience of bike rental upon request too.
Cleanliness wise, overall great upkeep!
Rooms are clean, bed is comfortable.
Aircon functions well. Convenience of a mini fridge and a small safe.
For a simple place, consistent hot water in the shower was awesome.
Complimentary morning coffee upon request was a really nice touch for a simple homestay too.
Nice small pool for a refreshing dip on a hot day, and wonderfully maintained garden which provides a very relaxing feel; with a number of spots to just chill too if you're feeling lazy.

Minor issues (each dealt with/alternative solution):
When we arrived on the first day, they had some drainage issues. Slight 'flood' of the shower area. Fix: was seen to immediately, which was great.
The toilet in our first room was suboptimal ; needing 2 flushes for a clean flush. Fix: We had a change of rooms later in our stay and the toilet (single flush), as well as water pressure was better here possible because it was on the first floor.
No kettle. Fix: you can probably request for hot water from their kitchen if you need.

As mentioned, overall thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Definitely would recommend it to those looking for a simple fuss free place in the area. We had even been recommending it to family and if we return to the area, will not hesitate to stay here again.
Our gratitude extends to everyone at Puri Clinton for making our stay memorable!","heaven! small homestay style hotel, with freshwater pool, house shrine and palm trees, set at end of small alley so its super tranquil and green, with perfectly kind hosts at less than 25‚Ç¨/night! rooms were aircon'd & spacious, well kept, and cleaned daily (though no do-not-disturb-sign available to stop that, which i'd ve preferred for environmental reasons). free wifi."

The juices we ordered were also quite nice.
The prices are reasonable and quite worth the quality and quantity of food being served.
