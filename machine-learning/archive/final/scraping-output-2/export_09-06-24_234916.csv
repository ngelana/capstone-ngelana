I love tabanan always so as dina homstay.. so nice lovely owners and cozy environment.. very peaceful.. always coming again and again!!,"Best homestay experience you can get. I would give more than 5 stars if it would be possible. The rooms look much nicer in real life than on the photos. The bathrooms are amazing - they are open, so if it rains you can enjoy a real tropical shower. The price is very reasonable for what you get. The region is peacful and calm as is the beautiful garden. What really made the difference for us were Adi and his wife, who are the best Balinese hosts. We felt so welcome and at home. We even stayed longer than we planned because it was so chilled. Thank you for this wonderful experience. We will be back for sure.","The best homestay everüëèüëèbeautiful place to stay and so comfortable ü§© if we stay there, it feels like our home sweet home, the owner is very friendly. will back again soon!","This is one of the most lovely places in Bali. When I want to be alone with myself in a introspective mood, I go to this place. In immersed in a local community, on the way to the Batukaru Mountain. Is so quiet and the owners are always super cool, helpful, attentive.
The garden have a lot of trees: cacao, coffee, snake fruit, dragon fruit, jackfruit, durian.
Is a great place for contemplation and inspiration. Is close to Jatiluwih rice terraces, the most beautiful (I think), and also you can easy can walk to make the Batukaru trekking (not recommended for trekking beginners).
Btw the coffee flowers give an amazing smell!
I‚Äôm the area rain is quite common, bring your jacket and warm clothes, in the night is quite cold. The place is not a luxury place, but is easily a place that you can call home ‚ô•Ô∏è.","True gem! Quite! Home run! With very small family menu! But so tasty! Little gem with super cozy bed, garden and real open Bali bathroom! Owner is lovely humble guy who will do anything for you! Highly recommend"

The house is located in the middle of nature, 0,7km from the road and neighbors, you will be totally immersed. I had my bike, so it was easy to come and go. During the day, you can drive around to see the most beautiful part of Bali, rice fields everywhere! Do not hesitate to ask for help from the host.

My stay was incredible, thanks to Agus. He took care of everything in a lovely way and anticipated our needs. Tea, coffee, fruits from the garden, amazing local breakfast, dinner delivery, everything. Agus was staying in a house close to us, we couldn't see him from our house which let us privacy but he's not far and can be available with a text.

The room itself is really comfy and clean. The bed is soft and equipped with a big mosquito net (there were not many insects anyway). I loved the beautiful outside bathroom, with soap and shampoo at the disposal. The best attribute is the large terrace. It's even more beautiful than the photos when you hear nature and enjoy the relaxing vibe of the place.

Thank you again.","Wow üòç
A little piece of paradise.

I spent 2 nights there a couple of days ago.
It‚Äôs next to a typical Balinese village and close to the beautiful Jatiluwih rice terraces.

So many things I enjoyed : butterflies, palm trees, rice terraces, symphony of frogs and crickets at night, even saw many fireflies.

Freshly picked coconut being prepared as a drink in front of me. Tasting different fruits (even fern) growing wild on the premises and freshly picked for my breakfast.

Comfortable bed.
I loved the outdoor bathroom looking at palm trees when I showered.

The list can go on ‚Ä¶.

But, above all, it was the generosity, kindness and care of Adi and Agus.

As I didn‚Äôt have any transport, they cooked all the meals for me at a small extra cost and drove me to places I wanted to visit.

They provide soap and towels.
They provide water.
There‚Äôs tea and coffee and a flask of hot water.
There‚Äôs no fridge.
There‚Äôs no tv.
There‚Äôs no WiFi, but my data worked well.
I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anywhere to eat in the village.
It‚Äôs best to have your own transport as places to visit are in driving distance. But Adi and Agus will help if need be.

If you love nature and like being away from people I highly recommend duegoal farmhouse.
It was magical and restorative for me.

Thank you Adi and Agus üôèüèªüòä",,,
