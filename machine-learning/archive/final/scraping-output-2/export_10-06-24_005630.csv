A local pork restaurant and our driver was kind enough to take us there to try one of their usual dishes they eat regularly.

It was literally everything that is edible of the pork, but be warned it is spicy. So if you can't handle the heat then avoid, otherwise the experience is worth it.

No sodas or anything fancy, pineapples and local homemade iced teas.

Staff doesn't speak alot of English or really understand so best to visit with a local.","Cheap prices, delicious, cool place with a view of rice fields","It's Okay.
Food Price so-so
My opinion, the taste a bit spicy. I can't enjoy the food if spicy right. The quality is Okay, bring more taste then spicy.
Atmosphere, It's Good. Like the atmosphere.","Nice ambience, the place is located next to rice fields. The food prices are also affordable ranging from Rp 10.000-20.000. I recommend to order ""nasi special"" since it gets a lot of crunchies.","An authentic local restaurant with a very reasonable price. If you'd like yo experience a local balinese food, visit here. Very big space with beautiful ricefield view."

Good cooked.

The place is quiet (if not are full) with rice fields around (if you want to hurry up! In Bali in a few years the rice fields are changed by beach clubs or similar).

The crew is friendly and the prices affordable.

Recommended in this area.","Absolute hidden gem. Stunning open views across rice fields, and loads of space for guests. You can rent a private hut/gazebo at the far end, or you can dine at one of the long oak tables with plenty of space. There's a kids play area too, and the whole warung is surrounded by ponds with goldfish and white koi. The breeze here is wonderful - and all this before you've even looked at the menu!
Simbar Menjangan offers a mix of local Indonesian/ Balinese cuisine and western favourites, and everything we tried was cooked to perfection and presented beautifully (see photos).
This is the perfect place for a birthday, a family gathering or large event, and you can book it for weddings and other special occasions. However when we visited on a quiet Sunday lunchtime we had the entire place to ourselves and it was a really peaceful, beautiful experience.
We will be back üòä","Nice garden restaurant out skirt denpasar city, good for small and medium group gathering, with ricefield  and susnset view",Comfortable place for lunch and dinner. With rice fields in front of you.  Very rural feel with breeze during lunch on the wooden table and chair.,"Some of the best local food I‚Äôve had, and a magical location. Come for sunset. Wear i sect repellent."

Would definitely come to here againnn,"Not quite sure about the food because we only ordered Caffe Latte, Americano, and fried banana which were very good. Will try the other foods some other time. Love the place but don't forget to bring anti mosquito lotion, especially if you plan to visit around dusk time.",I didn't have chance to try the food and drinks as the only waitress was busy with 1 table only. nevertheless the place itself is nice by the rice field.,"Not busy, good food/portion/price.
