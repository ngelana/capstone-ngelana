The surroundings and the garden of the property are both very beautiful. And during the night I had a good rest undisturbed by nothing else that the sounds of nature.

However, I came here to find quietness to relax and focus on my projects, and with the loud noises of the construction they’re doing now in the property it’s not easy to do so.

Nevertheless the rest is good, you can breathe fresher air and feel more authentic local Balinese culture here just going for a walk around and seeing their daily life.

There is also a beautiful unexploited beach nearby within walkable distance, and still there are rice fields without that much infrastructure.","Exceptional accommodation! Can't recommend it enough! :)

This room had by far the best furniture of all accommodation I ever had in this price range. It was super clean. Really well working AC, very comfortable bed.
The area around is nice and quiet and there are so many beautiful beaches close by to discover (but you will need a motorbike for that).

On top of that, the hosts are soo friendly and courteous and the checkin/checkout was flexible.
Thank you so much for this wonderful stay! :)",Very recommended place if you're looking for a quiet place where you can see a rice field in front of the house. The owner and his wife are super friendly. The room is also clean and tidy. The bathroom is super clean. Everything is super good. I can't find any negative about this place.,"The owner family is very nice and welcoming. Room is as in the pictures , a bit smaller but the windows are gorgeous, there are no table to work with laptop and there are construction on the second floor so you probably will need to search for some coworking space if you need table and quiet","It was pleasant stay, calm & serene surroundings.  Pleasantly surprised found a bird nest in garden infront our room. Laundry services were good. Food delivery for our breakfast from Kedai JJ was delicious & good. Mr Dewa & wife was very helpful arranging our transportation to city.  We will come and stay again."
