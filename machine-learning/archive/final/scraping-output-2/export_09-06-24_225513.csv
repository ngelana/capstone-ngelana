Banjar, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81152, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=6278704962857587645,OPERATIONAL,,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.8,60,,"This is actually a difficult review to write. As almost everyone else writes, the rooms, view, pool, food, service and everything else is breathtaking. One of our group stayed in a floating villa, while the rest stayed in the rooms in the valley. Just look at the various photos to see. Although we planned to use the Spa, it was closed while we were there.

The only downside is the location. It is far, far, from other activities on a very narrow, steep, winding road. This is the only reason to give it less than 5 stars.

Bottom line: If you are looking to simply chill, stay in a stunning villa, eat excellent food (and drink excellent coffee), and swim in a beautiful infinity pool, this is definitely the place for you.

If you are looking for additional activities in the Munduk area, I recommend something closer.","A peaceful and remote location. My wife and I stayed in the floating villas and it was a very cool experience. The food and hospitality is very good. The general manager Fajar is very friendly and went above and beyond to celebrate my birthday. The entire staff and band sang it and they brought out some great desserts. The location is remote and hilly, so keep that in mind when visiting. But it's far less crowded and still luxurious as the hotels we stayed in Ubud and Nusa Dua. If you want a calm, serene, and relaxing jungle vibe with comfort and good food this is your place.","BEYOND WONDERFUL experience!

Some reviews say this is far from everything and I disagree. It is 20-25 minutes from Ulun Danu Beratan and from stunning waterfalls, twin lakes, etc. and the view/location 1000% makes up for jt.

You are in paradise, literally staying in a luxury adult treehouse above the clouds. I have stayed at 5-star resorts prior (Ritz Carlton‚Äôs, Hiltons, Melia, etc.) and nothing compares quite to this unique experience. If you‚Äôre thinking of Elevate Bali or similar - do yourself a favor and book this place instead. You won‚Äôt find many other places like it. It is an intimate place because of its low occupancy (limited number of rooms available) yet high-class service. The hospitality is top notch (they remember your names and are genuinely happy to work here) and rooms are so unique staying in a luxurious treehouse bungalow. Fajar the manager personally introduced himself and all the staff is incredibly friendly. Saturday live music nights and hibachi is truly special. We are so grateful to have stayed here and for the amazing reviews that lead us here. They are all true!

We cannot recommend this hotel enough! It is not a resort - it is a once in a lifetime experience!","This place is an architectural feat of humanity! The entire place is intermingled with the forest around it. The floating villas are basically adult treehouses. It‚Äôs truly magical and one-of-a-kind.

After a week and a half in over-stimulating Uluwatu and Ubud, I wanted a place to just retreat and assimilate my Bali experience before I went home. I left my villa only one day to tour the Munduk falls that are a short drive away. I spent the rest of the time basically on the balcony of the villa in awe of the surroundings, just chilling in forest vibes. I saw the Milky Way on a clear night and the rainstorms were an extra treat.

The service was incredible. The staff, especially the manager, were super kind, patient, and helpful. Everyone went above and beyond.

Two points of note - First, this place is truly secluded and on a very steep hill so you can‚Äôt leave the resort and walk anywhere.  It‚Äôs what you get for going to a place so submerged in its surroundings. Second, the WiFi was too weak for video calls or if you want to work. I had some work to do which required a bit of patience to get through with the internet speed. If you‚Äôre looking for a place with strong WiFi, this isn‚Äôt it unfortunately. I had no problem streaming though.","We ended up in this hotel by chance, as there were no rooms available in the chosen one.  And this hotel exceeded all our expectations üëç Magnificent villas with jacuzzi, very friendly staff, luxury beds and a magnificent atmosphere of nature, like from Hayao Miyazaki‚Äôs cartoons and breathtaking views of Western Bali.  We will definitely come back again üôè"

Our guide was üíØüëçüèº, informative and never rushed. Simple stuff but good fun all the way.","Amazing experience with their adventure package.  We got the one with canoeing, forest walk, visiting coffee plantation with 2.5 hrs of ATV fun.  Turns out the last activity are the best of all and a total surprise lol.

First we stay in Kuta so it‚Äôs actually 2.5 hr ride to where the adventure begin.  Our driver Riki was early and waited us in our resort parking lot until we meet him at the time we scheduled.  There‚Äôs a lot of traffic but he is great in making sure we are comfortable and also answered some of our questions about Bali.  On the way he offered to stop in a couple places for photo.

Our tour guide, Rida, greet us with a big smile and waiver on his hand.  We received a very nice lemongrass tea as our welcoming package.  Rida is very patient and check in with us every single process to make sure we understand where we are going, what will we be doing and if we are comfortable with every activity.  We started by riding Komodo ATV down to the lake, and canoe for about 30 minute with a very friendly local lady.  After that we did a short forest walk.

My husband and I shared an ATV (the rate is different if you want to ride solo) and we took turn to drive.  It was so much fun and we never drive such a low rider ATV before, it almost feels like we are in the racing track lol.

On our way to the lunch spot we stopped in a coffee field for 5 minute looking at the plants before heading to an open space farm house for lunch.  Food is freshly prepared and refreshments are available for purchase.  They even served us dessert with local coffee they grow.

Finally, Rida offered to take us to a muddy track for a couple loop of messy fun.  We had no idea how much we LOVED this surprise.  Hubby did three loops in a roll and we had mud all over us when we finished.  It‚Äôs honestly the best activity for both of us.  Rida took plenty of videos and photos for us so we can just focus on the play.

Upon returning to the resort, they got towels and shower room ready for us to clean up.  They even offer us to fill out a feedback form before we took off.

All in all, very professional service and hosts are very helpful and friendly.

My recommendation is eat before your mud track ride AND maybe you wanna change to a bathing suit with no shoes unless you don‚Äôt mind cleaning out the muds afterwards, took us a good 15 min to clean our shoes and clothes lol.","Folks,

Great adventure. Really amazing people and very accomodating.  Great routes and well maintained buggy. My dad and mom loved this and has been one of their best experiences of their lifetime.

Well done munduk team. Great hospitality and service. Keep it up.","Brilliant experience and Jonny, our guide, could not have been more charming, engaging, interesting and fun. The ATV track was a blast, driving through the countryside and villages with the scent of the cloves drying by the roadside was magical and the waterfall was stunning. If you only have one day near Munduk, or are thinking of coming to Munduk, do this tour - you‚Äôll love it!","Amazing Experience !

We did the waterfall buggy trip and it was a blast for our family.
We talked a bit with the owner-Pak Johny who is very friendly and nice. Our guide named Johny (different one), was very caring and really took good care of us.

The trip was about 3 hours, there was a circuit after our 30-40 mins drive, then lunch then the trip to waterfall.

Overall, it was an unforgettable and truly fun trip !"

Breathtaking view and the food that we tried was all good. The price is slightly high but there are tons of restaurants in Bali that charge the same price and the view is nowhere near as beautiful as this one.,Very beautiful stop for food and coffee in Munduk. Staff are really nice. Food is good and the coffee and views are great! Try the duck or tenderloin steak!,"Great view, very kind staff and nice food!","I personally thought they charge way to much for standard tasting food. We ordered the Mushroom Soup which was okay, and the sauce on the pizza tasted like tomato ketchup instead of tomato sauce / marinara sauce. Both were nothing special. But the Salmon Salad was refreshing. Staff said their fave dish was Oxtail Soup but charged 225k ++ which I thought was absurd, it wasn't even a 5-star restaurant or dining experience.

The place is very secluded, about a 2 hour drive from Denpasar. We went there on a Sunday around 3pm. There was only 1 other table occupied. The restaurant is open air and was quite spacious. There was a small infinity pool but only in-house guests are allowed to use it. The view of the local greenery was nice. It was foggy so we weren't able to enjoy the sunset.

There was a minimum spending of 450k IDR per table, which was disappointing as we originally wanted to just have coffee after our lunch in Bedugul.",Just question¬ø do.you offer pork? Because I don't eat in restaurants which offer pork?
