-Quiet and secluded
-Surrounded by lush green nature
-Used the pool often
-Breakfast was fresh- included Indonesian foods, eggs, bit of fruit
-The staff were lovely
Cons:
-The shower- the water would either be boiling hot or cold and would alternate every 30 seconds so it was quite difficult taking a comfortable shower. The staff called a mechanic and tried their best to fix the situation and make us comfortable.
-I contacted the host on Airb*b about the water and he never responded.

Overall I liked my stay for the price- you get what you pay for.","I loved it! My favourite stay in Bali!absolutely a gem. Service was great, food was tasty and the location is paradise. It's quite hard to find it but we loved it so much that we changed our plans and returned! Sound of birds and geckos, plants and the best pool ever!",Very chill and quiet place! The staff are lovely and very helpful and you literally don‚Äôt need to leave the place as they provide many services. I had a lovely massage right next to my room. The only downside I would say is that the food variety and dishes are not great but other than that I had a lovely stay!,The stay is nestled in the forest with lots of greenery around. The location is a little difficult to find because of the narrow roads. The room was clean. The place is filled with lots of insects and reptiles. The spa is good here. At night the pool area does not have any light. The breakfast menu is the same repeated everyday and they do not have any other option than bread and eggs which is quite disappointing.,"The location of the resort is really nice, it feels like being in the middle of the jungle. The rooms are also nicely furnished and have impeccable views. The pool, however, was not clean and looked green and dirty instead of blue and clean. The pool was one of the reasons we booked the resort and unfortunately we were not able to use it. The host also claimed that they might clean the pool, but they didn‚Äôt hold that promise. The rooms were fairly clean but the curtains were really dirty and the bed sheets were partly ripped, which is a pity as the rooms
themselves are really nice. The food in the restaurant is not worth the price. The breakfast was okay. We left with the feeling that we did not get what we paid for."

However, any attraction is far away and you'd have to have a bike to get  there. We were hosted by a friendly family and they also have a small spa (room) for a massage and a beauty salon right next to it, not very relaxing but a good and strong massage. Also, if you're afraid of dogs, you should give this village a miss as they are everywhere, literally. Every house has a dog and it's left in front of the house as a guard, they even follow you around.","My travel partner and I stayed in the gorgeous Balinese room for a great price from agoda. The room was a steal at $12 USD and perfect for a honeymoon, for about ten days in October, 2016. Decorated in gorgeous, hand crafted Balinese style furniture and luxurious marble floor, the room provided sweet luxury away from noisy Ubud. We also had an attached bathroom and okay wifi, making it quite comfortable. Breakfast was included and dinner is available for purchase. The owners will also hook you up with a scooter for a good price. Just don't expect to get a hair cut; the owner-esthetician is always booked with locals.

The family that runs Indah is quite friendly, speaking some English, and both children will chat with you in fluent English. The children will also help out around the homestay, bringing food and tea on occasion. Don't be surprised. You'll also enjoy the romping shitzus that play freely around the courtyard, which is quite pleasant, complete with fruit trees and a typical family temple. You'll find burning incense and fresh Hindu offerings daily among statues that complete the experience, as they are what makes Bali, well, magical, exotic Bali.

This location is conveniently located about a ten minute scooter drive from the Ubud palace and equally from the Tegalalang rice paddies (during low traffic, of course). (It's easiest to get around by scooter, if you can, because going anywhere by taxi in Ubud is a nightmare.) And yes, wear your helmet! The police on Bali will glady extort a few hundred thousand IDRs at any opportunity.",The room we had booked on Agoda was not available when we showed up and no alternative was proposed.,"Amazing value.

Very friendly and welcoming family.

If you have transport, it's a great location that let's you visit nearby places without going through Ubud's traffic.","I made an early review before checking out,  but now I have edit it in order to say that this is not only a awesome place, but It is managed by incredible people. During my stance there I got very ill and the owners cared me like my own parents would have done. Moreover they took me to the clinic at 4 a.m. at night. Nothing to say but good things.

Terima kasih sepenuh hati üôèüïâÔ∏è"
