Ive had mie goreng special, dimsum and fresh blueberry juice. Top of the top.
What else do u want?","Been sick ! I donâ€™t recommend this restaurant for foreigners at all. You just have to see by yourself on the video. The noodles are worse than what you buy in supermarket, the soup as well, look like frozen and then put to micro wave. We ordered teriyaki chicken but had something else, at least the most tasty. I mean even the prawn crisp werenâ€™t crispy, thatâ€™s say a lot for a Â«Â warungÂ Â»â€¦ So I donâ€™t know if it was too early on the evening (18pm) and everything was the leftover from the day before, or microwaved before the kitchen open or whatever but honestly even the drinks tasted like toilet product. Of course Iâ€™ve been sick after that. Maybe it was unfortunate or a bad day but Iâ€™m not gonna risk my health another time and I donâ€™t recommend this at all. The French fries, Â«Â kebabÂ Â», sushi, burger and other stuff with no sens could have warn me before ordering.","After leaving Amed this morning, I was starting to get hungry. What  a gem of a place to find! Absolutely delicious meal - and cupaccino! Friendly and welcoming. Great service. I feel totally refreshed to continue my travels.
Oh and the view.... awesome!
[Thank you Kedai Qita]","It's so random to find a place like this in the middle of nowhere. ðŸ¤¯

Great variety of really tasty food, cappuccino was excellent, and smoothies just delicious.

Fair price, kind staff, superb location!","Staff was really friendly, prices are cheap. They tried the best to accomodate our needs. We ordered vegetable salad but get fruit salad with cheese (??) instead. Overall good experience. Not the best food I ate, but for the price it is ok."
