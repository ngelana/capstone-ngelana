You can easily spend the day without getting bored.
Super organized and structured, they have a nice system of no cash no card payment, you just fill up a bracelet with a balance and use it inside the park to pay for F&B.
Tickets to be booked online as they have a discount for online bookings.","I’m 45, and Had a blast. Possible the best water park in Asia. No wait times, rode some slides multiple times in a row as fast as I could climb the stairs.  Waterflow was perfect on most of slides and lazy river.  Very beautiful and well kept grounds, you feel like you’re in a tropical paradise.   Reasonable priced too and staff very friendly.","Worth it the time and ticket! It was the best day we had in Bali. I recommend going as early as possible for virtually no lines for the more popular slides.

No cash or card payments in the waterpark, you have to use wristbands, but you can load it up with money easily & are refunded with cash when you leave.

The slides are fantastic & so much fun. They have a pretty wide variety.

Service & staff are so positive and lovely, they really go the extra mile to make you smile, even though some of their jobs are pretty tedious.

Food at the park was really good & decently priced for tourists. My only complaint is that they don’t allow outside food in & only allow you to bring one bottle of water per person & I didn’t see any water fountains. Annoying if you want to bring in healthy/cheap food options.

You’re allowed to leave the waterpark and reenter if you need.

The cabanas are totally worth it for group bookings for the water, towels, safe box & shady place to chill.","Awesome family water park. Get in quick to book/ reserve your nice shady bungalow, complete with safe, these bungalows are comfortable for small families right up to the bigger ones. The park itself was great, mapped well for easy navigation, clean and well maintained. There was a small wait in line to enter the park, wrist bands were handed out with money credit applied. This is returned on exit. Lines weren't too bad inside, however it was fairly busy with large groups of families. There was plenty of food to select from, from sushi, burgers, chips, pizza, smoothies, noodles and more all presented well and served and delivered to our bungalow or able to be brought on the spot. Showers and toilets were extremely clean and well maintained also.
Staff were friendly as I found in most of bali and happy to help with enquiries and just a chat in general. Photos avail from professional camera man also and developed for purchase There too. A fantastic day to spend here on slides , swimming in the lazy river or just watching the kids in the kids pool and splash area highly recommend.","From the moment we arrived it was a disaster.
We arrived right at 9am so the line was abit long but people were going through SLOWLY due to customer service.
when it was our turn the lady said we paid for the wrong tickets she then took over 25 minutes to fix the issue and charging us the remaining amount.
Their whole system is pathetic with their wrist bands and putting money on them - they need to do a better job and what’s convenient for tourists > she tells me it’s just money for the food and drinks so we put money on both our bands.
I then asked her about the huts to hire for the day and she pointed me where to go. I went to hire a hut and getting told to put more money on my band as we had to pay using our wrist band smh. They need to explain things properly and from the start.
Later on - I went to go on a slide ride with my husband and got a hello and go up. The staff working down there could of told me about my shorts being jeans that they weren’t allowed on any slides - it was annoying walking all the way up and getting told I can’t go on the slide with my shorts.
The service here from majority of the staff puts this place down.

The cafe and spa staff were nice and friendly but majority of the rides staff ARE NOT.

Over all - would recommend going anywhere else but here.

The spa place - that’s annoying aswell how you go to get services they’re standing there free yet you have to book in a time for hair , nails or massage."

A lot of facilities for in house guests to explore. Room very comfortable but light a bit dim and the wardrobe is inside the bathroom together with the place to put luggage but just next to WC. So, we decided to put our luggage on the floor near bedside.

Very nice sunset at beach front and pavement when people can do their morning or evening run. You can walk to nearby beach side which provide a lot other beach activities also.

Hotel have function room to cater for meeting groups also.

Short walk to local eateries, bar and massage centre.","Amazing property with great location and access to beach side. Theirs is a very huge property with all amenities like swimming, pool basket ball, pool volley ball, Hammock etc. they have 2 restaurants within the hotel premises. We loved everything about the property felt a sense of peace while staying here. Only disadvantage would be their breakfast options, there is not much for vegetarians even if there are options they are not good.
Other than that I would recommend to book the property to have nice quiet personal time",Beautiful. Staff very attentive and friendly. Love to feel the happiness of the staff not just because they are paid to be nice to guests. Relaxing by the pool was easy and didn’t have to struggle to find a place. Thank you to the staff from reception all the way to the gardeners everyone deserves a big thank you for the excellent job,"Our family had an amazing time on vacation. We enjoyed the superb service and the wide selection of Indian and Indonesian breakfast selections at The Sands Restaurant, which has a stunning view of the beach. The Lagoon Rooms were clean and nicely furnished. Because of the resort's excellent position in the heart of Kuta, exploring was fun and simple.","Really lovely hotel. The rooms are delightful and modern and the hotel itself has a lovely ambiance. The spa is incredible, and I wish I had more treatments there. That being said, I can not give this hotel 5 stars because honestly the service at the Sands restaurant is really bad, especially for the price you are paying. I had to wait over 15 minutes every time I went (other than breakfast) to be greeted or have my order taken. And the order itself takes much longer than you'd expect to arrive.
Don't let that steer you away from this hotel, though! The views of the ocean are great and you will have a wonderful stay here!"

I got a fabulous back, neck and shoulder massage for 30 minutes for only £3.50!!!!","It was an awesome experience staying at Swiss-Bel especially their customer service. Special mention to the manager Victor Effendi who went beyond to resolve my room issue that I had with its lock, not only he got my issue resolved but also he did follow it up each morning with me. Amazing customer service over all, Thank you all staff and Victor who is managing the team pretty well.","After staying at this hotel, now i know why they have high rated review. Here is why. Before we checked out they asked me to rate the hotel before leaving. While u were rushing out, u rated 5 stars and left no comments.

My room (room with pool view) was far from the lobby. Has balcony and 1 outdoor chair and table. Floor was a bit oily. We used room slipper all the time. The room was provided with coffee, tea, sugar, creamer, kettle, fridge, and toiletries.
The location is near laundry, convenience store and airport. Limited parking.",This is a very nice hotel. We searched for few hotels around Bali that we saw from guest review in tiktok this is a good hotel. Everything is good in this hotel. They also have affordable laundry. Nice and kind employees. Will definitely book again.,"one of the best hotel by price to performance category.
spacious room , good n clean bathroom, nice staff from Security to Cleaner were in good attitude n greeting.

Ask for room with pool view is the best option.

The beautiful and relaxing pool in the middle of the building and quite iconic scenery when entering the lobby was the best thing in this hotel.

Breakfast, lunch and dinner events are just good I cannot ask more, everything is just right and acceptable with quite  various menus from indonesian-western menu.

The location was not the best part, yes indeed this hotel is close to the airport, but not quite near from beach or shopping area, need online taxi or rent a car ."

The hotel premises and the rooms are beautiful. They also organize an activity each morning for the guests and it was nice to learn about traditions and culture of Bali through activities. Totally worth the price, I recommend!","Pros: We enjoyed our stay here - the rooms are very well designed and create a relaxed and comfortable environment. The bed was comfortable with four pillows. The bathroom featured a rain shower head from the ceiling. The room was outfitted with a mini fridge, coffee/tea service, and safe. The balcony featured a comfortable Bali bed, cafe table, and overlooked the pool. We shared beautiful and serene moments watching the full moon rise through the palm fronds.
Cons: we could hear noisy people fairly easily in the hallway late at night and sometimes from the room next door. So, sound insulation wasn’t the greatest, but not a complete deal breaker. We were first given a room that faced a wall and alleyway, we showed them our booking upgrade payment for a pool-facing room and the staff changed us to the room we paid for. Location is not ocean front and down a narrow alley. The breakfast was ok, but not stellar.","Excellent resort for a leisure stay to relax and unwind yourself. The staff is very cooperative. They have an excellent in house spa who provide a great service.
Breakfast is a limited choice but a variety menu with sumptuous taste as well as quality, along with decent Vegetarian options also available. Their soap/ conditioner is of some really good brand. Overall a wonderful stay to wrap up our Bali visit- Added advantage is that it's very close to Airport , Mall and prime areas of Kuta.. Thank you team for your warm hospitality.","Excellent staff, perfect room, hotel was more beautiful than we could have imagined, a hidden gem! It was a little odd that staff were recording the audio of our check in process, but overall it went very smooth.

Hotel location is excellent, within 15 minutes of just about everything

Thank you for a great stay, we wish we had more time in kuta !","Not only is the location of this hotel fantastic, but the rooms are also clean and spacious.

I recently had an experience at a hotel in Bali, and I wanted to share my thoughts. Unfortunately, I encountered some issues with the night manager. When I approached him about a misplaced keycard, he was unhelpful and not very respectful. It was disappointing, especially considering he was the night manager. I hope the hotel management takes note of this behavior and addresses it. Despite this, the overall stay was decent, but I wanted to share this experience with fellow travelers.

No privacy. Otherwise, breakfast is good. Swimming pool is good. Perfect place to explore the nearby area.","You get what you paid for. Room is cheap and size is quite OK. Location is good, near many restaurants and waterbom. There js balcony in every room to hang wet swimsuits.

But this hotel totally does not deserve to be called a 4 stars hotel.

The hotel is run down and gloomy. It is dirty, look at the disgusting water kettle! This is unacceptable. The hairdryer stopped working after 1 minute and cannot be turned on anymore. The bed is hard. The room is noisy, because there is a live music venue next door and room are facing the road. You need to get rooms facing the pool","Very ordinary hotel. Wouldn't visit again.
Moved to three different rooms during our 5 night stay. The air-conditioning didn't work in one room, the safe didn't work in another. The shower didn't work properly. The sinks were clogged and overflowing. The cleanliness of the rooms was very ordinary. Very dated hotel. Stayed at a nearby hotel before visiting this one, and for the money we paid at Eden Hotel.

Would have been nice if the pool was open a bit later than 8pm. All in all, a very nice hotel but next trip we will be staying in legian.",My wife and I honeymooned at this resort. The staff and amenities were incredible. The location was delightfully situated along the beautiful coast. The resort is close to many attractions and they are all within walking distance.

Security check does really good job on checking cars and bags and people walk in so we felt very safe and relaxing in the resort . Foods and drinks in the resort are very reasonable price ,so much cheaper as compared to Hard rock . This is a very nice cozy family resort ,couldn't recommend enough ! Love their brekky and dinner too . Staffs there are all very friendly and smiley ! Will definitely back again !","Very nice place to stay. Staffs were amazing. Our kids enjoined the pools and they couldn't have enough 😜
Food was also good. We loved the buffet breakfast. They had buffet dinner as well which was reasonably priced. However two buffet meals daily were too much for us and we decided to have dinners outside. Lots of good restaurants around the hotel as well to choose from.
We stayed 7 nights but I would say 5 nights would have been enough for us. Not so many things to do around the hotel unless you want to travel around Bali in the hot and humid weather.","This is a great resort if you are traveling with a family and are looking for convenience and a fun time. Great location, easy checkin, great pools, cocktails are great, food is good also. Buffet breakfast is very handy. The family room was a little small but functional for everything we needed. Hotel, despite being very big and busy, is lovely, quiet, and relaxing. The art shop within the compound is amazing, quality is fantastic and prices are very affordable. They'll also package your paintings up safely if you are traveling by plane. We will certainly be back!!","We spent a tot of 5 nights in this amazing resort and we could not be more satisfied.

The room was spacious and fully equipped with a good selection of toiletries robes and linen, opened up to the fish pond and was super convenient and comfortable

The food and drinks served are great and so so reasonably priced it was so nice ordering cocktails without being afraid of being broken soon after

The pool area is simply amazing and has anything a kid can hope for, the kids club is so nice and clean and fully stocked with toys of all kind

The staff is the pillar and backbone of this place. Anyone was amazingly nice and welcoming and the service is top notch. Just the amazing staff would grant a visit back. The hotel is lucky to have such amazing employees from the reception, waiting staff, gardeners and room attendants, you name it

Overall if we could leave 6 stars we would. We will definitely be back on our next trip","Absolutely loved staying here. We had interconnecting rooms and they were dated but very clean and comfortable. The cleaners did a great job each day keeping the room cleaned to a high standard. We stayed with our children 3 and 1 years old and were obviously worried about them getting sick but they were well the entire stay thanks to this great hotel.

Fabulous location because it is so near to airport. Eateries and shops available within walking distance. Breakfast was slightly disappointing.,"We recently stayed at the Grand Ixora Resort.
The staff were so accommodating and helpful. We were grateful for their tips as it was our first time coming to Bali. They were all so friendly and kind. We loved our experience with the staff.

The location was perfect for a first timer.

Unfortunately the room was very small, smaller than we expected. And not as clean as we are used to. I would say because it was our first experience in Bali that we might let this one go. The pool was lovely too.

Actually what I really loved about staying at the Grand Ixora, was walking to our room and each time seeing private residences on the side street next door, just so beautiful!","The towels in the room were more grey than white, the bedding was stained and yellowing and the AC noise kept me awake for a good few hours. Such a shame as I chose to stay here again after enjoying my first stay so much however this time was a different experience. The rooms themselves are spacious and modern with modern amenities","Zero star hotel, worst 2 nights in Bali.
I would not recommend this hotel for anyone.

1- staff were not polite, very slow service, refused to provide cutlery in the room.
2- the bed sheets, towels and the room in general was not clean there were spots everywhere, nothing in this room was clean.
3- we booked for two adults room with twin bed and the only available room when we arrived was the room near the pool with no balcony. although we did book days ahead to avoid this.
the room was uncomfortable due to people’s noise coming from the pool and the music that was played until 10 pm.
5- the lighting is very poor and dim we could not see properly we had to open flash lights to look for our stuff in the bags.
6- the boiler smells like spices and it was very dirty we couldn’t use it.
7- the room space was too small.
8- we did not like the breakfast dishes most of them were Indonesian dishes, the glass cups were not cleaned properly we can see the stains and smell them.
9- the slippers in our room were used previously.
10- the Air conditioner is not working properly which is a big problem in Bali hot weather.
11- no one was answering the phone in the reception.
12- toilets did not have the normal bidet it was the eco bidet which was very poor quality and insufficient to do its purpose.
13- refrigerator was not maintained, we could not use the freezer because it was blocked with ice.

Everything seems old, dirty or bad quality in this hotel.
After what we saw this cannot be 4 stars hotel, also, this is NOT what resorts shall be like.","Lovely stay here, rooms were spacious and included a mini fridge. Only downside is the Air conditioning is quite loud.

The hotel is within walking distance for pretty much everything and only a 5 min drive from the airport.

+ Room was quiet, which is good.
+ location was strategic. Near airport, near mall, near many groceries, med shop, etc
+ clean, include the towel
+ the windows were openable. Its a good feature for those who like heath air circulation.
+ has a rooftop. Good for sunset, it said. But i didt go there yet.
+- Amenities were standard, just toothpaste dan toothbrush. Still acceptable for men, dunno for women.
+- Not yet a smart tv but for me (personal opinion), it didnt matter. The tv also has many channels with good quality.
- No vitrase. Your option was only no natural ligth with the blackout curtain, or exposed from outside.
- my room was number 120, its shower drainage taller than the floor. I had to sweep the water to the sink.
- service was a bit poor. I requested drinking water, but until i checked out, the water didnt delivered. Maybe the staff went overwhelmed because i stay here when peak season.","I was great staff, great service from all the staff. I would recommend to them to upgrade breakfast and pool area. We were out in pool area no umbrella to relax under. When we asked the said they don't have. Even though showed in photo. The location great. Air conditioning was really good as well. And big shout out to Fredrick our guy that served us at pool bar. He was such good laugh. 👍 I did find pool bar didn't have all cocktails displayed on menu. But all round good.

love the massage in the resort and strongly recommended, lots of eateries along the street. hopefully there are nice Chinese food serve in future.","Bali Garden Beach Resort is a true gem. Its perfect beachfront location offers miles of scenic walks along the shore. All shopping centers, boutiques, and restaurants are just a step away from the resort.

The resort is renowned for its vast, beautiful garden. You'll feel like you're in a botanical wonderland filled with exotic plants, trees, and small ponds. As one of Bali's longest-standing resorts, it covers an enormous area. Among its three pools, the most impressive one is by the sea.

The food is fantastic, with excellent restaurants within the resort. The breakfast options include a buffet and à la carte.

Having stayed in 6-7 resorts in Bali so far, none of them compares to Bali Garden Beach Resort in terms of well-educated, trained, and courteous staff. Everything runs like a well-oiled machine.

The staff is exceptionally friendly and promptly responds to all requests. Candy, a staff member, approached us during breakfast and had a pleasant conversation, ensuring our satisfaction and comfort at the resort. The waitresses by the pool bar are delightful, always smiling and attentive.

This is the best accommodation in terms of value and experience. I will definitely return!","The resort was beautiful! Lovely staff and amazing food, with great pools and restaurants.

Aaron",Rooms were nice and the beds are sooo comfortable. Service is always with a smile. Room set up style is nice. All you can eat breakfast was delicious - big variety. You could choose your own egg cooked style. The pool is very clean and relaxing. There is a lift to access all floors. They have a printing service for last minute travel paperwork.,"Save yourself the trouble and frustrations book somewhere else. I found at least two cockroaches in the room, hair in the newly made bed. The room didn’t look clean dust everywhere. The breakfast buffet was terrible, we ended up eating else where. When we tried to order room service, over half the menu wasn’t available, took over a hour and was disgusting. None of the staff knew english either."

It's a beautiful restaurant and thought it was a fair price for the quality of food we received. Will return here again!","This place is nice however the service seems to lack urgency.. we ordered food, the two table came after us got their food. One of our dish was delayed and after 45-1 hour   it was presented beautiful but it was cold. Not only that we lost appetite waiting for more then 45 min we got the item cold. I recommend  come on a time that they are too busy so they can accommodate all your needs.","One of the best Indian restaurants you can ever find in Bali.

The food is just right there on top. The chicken and lamb meat are juicy and tender, the spices are rich but balanced, not to mention the tasty Biryani rice and Golgappa.

The service is also impeccable. The waitresses were very kind and attentive, even though it was a bit crowded. We were attended by Diah, who helped us with the menu, took some photos and even helped us get the cake for my niece. We couldn't be happier than this!","First time having lunch at this Indian restaurant because I saw the reviews. Quite expensive! Indian Restaurant in Singapore & Malaysia are still cheaper! The staff were friendly but we were disappointed with the Briyani rice which was dry and tasteless, the chicken Tikka was good but the taste wasn't strong enough. We can give this review because we have lived in Malaysia and Singapore for decades, so we know which food is authentic.","A fabulous experience. Every dish was one beating the other. Their presentation was stupendous too. Everything was so flavourful… 💕10/10 recommended!! The drinks, the desserts, the snacks… wow! 👏🏻👏🏻 the staff was super polite too. thank you for a great experience."

I was too annoyed as couldn't sleep because of noise from adjacent rooms, the walls are so paper thin, you can hear someone sneezing, running taps, there conversation. Someone walking in corridor. It was bad experience. Although staff is helpful and environment is good","I recently stayed at Bintang Kuta Hotel and overall, it was a mixed experience. The room and location were commendable, offering a comfortable stay with a convenient location. The hotel staff was also quite accommodating, adding a positive touch to the stay.

However, the breakfast was a letdown. It was consistently subpar, with a limited variety and the same menu almost every day. Vegetarians, in particular, might find the options disappointing. I wouldn't recommend opting for breakfast if you follow a vegetarian diet.

On the brighter side, the swimming pool was a highlight of the stay, providing a refreshing escape. The AC worked well, ensuring a comfortable temperature in the room. Unfortunately, the TV seemed to serve little purpose, offering limited entertainment options.","4 hotels this trip and this would be the pick of the crop. Excellent staff. Breakfast menu had a good range, rooms modern clean and excellent air-conditioning. Pool was clear and clean. Prices for 2024 very good.",Quaint hotel with clean rooms and decent facilities. Although could add a few more amenities in the rooms and bathrooms to provide a little more luxury. Very accommodating with guest requests.,"Two elevators.  5 floors with rooms.  The rooms on the 5th floor are noisy as there are air conditioner motors.  There are smoking rooms on the same floor and when the neighbors smoke, the smoke will enter your room too.  You should make some plan for smokers and plan for NON smokers. The lower rooms and near the pool are noisy because you can hear the water cascading.  If you have to have a conference in the room, choose to stay away from the pool area, i.e. the central block. The staff is quite friendly and helpful.

It's undoubtedly one of the best hotels for the price!

Strategically located, just a few minutes' walk to Kuta Beach, Kuta Art Market, restaurants, and malls. Despite being in a bustling area, the noise doesn't penetrate your room. There's an Alfamart next door, eliminating the need to go far for additional necessities.

The entrance is cool and air-conditioned, leading to the restaurant/breakfast area and a pleasant seating space next to the receptionist and by the pool. The pool always appeared clean during my stay, and the parking space is ample without being overly crowded.

Upon arrival, you receive a welcome drink and snack while waiting to check in. All the staff are consistently welcoming, friendly, and exceptionally helpful.

The room I stayed in was spacious with plenty of storage, a “breakfast bar” style seating area, and an abundance of chairs. Importantly, both the room and bathroom were impeccably clean. The room offers numerous electrical outlets, a thoughtful touch! Additionally, receiving caramel chocolate every afternoon is a delightful gesture. The bed is large and comfortable, and there's ample desk space in case you need to work. The WiFi is notably fast.

While a hairdryer isn't included, it's easy to request, and they promptly provide and send it to your room. Although I didn't try their food, judging from the menu, it looks delicious and reasonably priced.

Despite my room lacking a mini-fridge, it wasn't a significant issue. I highly recommend this hotel and will certainly stay there again in the future!","AC is not cold enough, already set to 16 degree but still feels like >26 🥲
Too lazy to complain, hence we enjoy the ‘cold’

Also no hair dryer and fridge available here, but you’ll get welcome drink, and afternoon snack during your stay.

Location is perfect, breakfast is so-so (it’s ala carte, hence you have to pick drink and main menu)",I've stayed in this hotel before and was very impressed. This time I rebooked it and am disappointed. The room had  abig puddle of water in the middle which not only i cleanedyswlf so i dont have ro wait foe housekeeping etc buy also has hair arpund tje toilet. Breakfast costs twice what it would cost for what I've git in England yet it was absolutely awful. Inedible. Except in Englad I would sent it back and not have to pay without any argument. Anyway discount or special offer means you will get exactly the SAME as you would for full price which is what makes it a special offer this was not a discount this was just that. A £20 room and an overpriced awful breakfast,"convenient location, near everything.  Breakfast is delicious.  Staff are nice.  Room is spacious and clean.  Good value for money.","Strategicly located on kuta street, many restaurant and minimarket around the hotels.

Very close to the beach ( go through the kuta art market ) and waterboom bali

The room is clean & quite spacious, AC cold, clean shower for the price they offered it really is value for money. They even give you chocolate as part of their turn-down service

And also they offered family room ( 1 double bed & 1 bunk bed )"

Good price & lovely service. It isn’t a luxury spa but fantastic therapists. Highly recommended.  You will need to book at least 1-2 days in advance as this place is popular.","Used the day spa pretty much daily in my recent stay in Kuta, every single staff member was lovely, kind, happy and so professional. Without a doubt the best massages I’ve ever had! And the consistency was crazy! Each different masseuse had the exact same technique and system.
My husband and I had the couple 3hr his n hers treatment and it was lovely.
Cant wait to return to Bali just to be able to visit again.","We booked few nights here because good review. The staff and room here are pretty good but later on we found  a big problem.
something falling from ceiling on the floor looks like bug’s egg, due to we have toddler crawling around so we requested to change to different room.
Then we had the same thing in the new room so went over to ask reception about it, she knew there is termite problem in most of room.
She suggest we pay extra to upgrade to superior room and maybe it won’t happened again.
We both think room and place are nice but termite issue really to put us off.
End of the day, we have to take everything out the suitcase to clean those termite out, just in case we bring it back to Australia.","Great hotel, in a really convenient area.  I stayed at Febri's for a long girls weekend and we loved our stay.

The rooms were really clean and the beds were firm but comfortable.  The pool was a good size and was lovely to relax by.

The restaurant food was reasonable, with the standouts on the menu being the chicken satay and banana fritters.

We had a couple of massages in the Spa that were fantastic,

All in all it was a great hotel."

Indah was around every day to make sure that your rooms were OK and if you had any problems she would get straight onto them in her new job roll at the hotel. Breakfast was nice with a good selection of different cuisines.. The staff are very friendly and helpful we made friends with Gusti who made sure we had clean towels by the pool on a daily basis..

We arrived late at night and were greeted by beautiful friendly staff who showed us to our rooms ( superior garden room with adjoining). We had a beautiful large king size bed the We found so comfy , icey cold air-conditioning and wall mounted TV. Next to the bed boasted a massive glass window looking into the bathroom complete with bath and over head shower. There's a small hanging cupboard,  basic storage and kitchen, fridge and facilities, small safe and bench space.  The adjoining room was much the same with 2 single beds. The grounds were extremely well kept and traditional gardens, with ponds and beautiful flowers. Although we were on the floor level with only our two rooms attached to our little bungalow there were some on a 1st story over looking both the pool and garden areas. The pool and swim up bar were well kept and not crowded , nice and deep with a smaller pool for the Lil ones. The buffet breakfast was always yummy with a selection of noodles, fruit, eggs cooked to request , fresh juices , toast, pasties and much more. The restaurant was well presented, friendly staff and overlooked discovery mall. Outside the hotels parking bay was the money exchange place we used, we found he was generally higher than the other money exchangers.
If I had to complain about anything we did have a work shed beside our room and found sometimes the workers were noisy in the morning when starting work which made a sleep in difficult but other than that we couldn't fault this place. We highly recommend trying this place out and we will definitely stay here again.","Gorgeous place, cute little garden and a nice pool. The rooms were clean but beware of some sharp corners, if you're having a toddler with you! Reasons the 1 Star less, as the interior could need some fixing. Breakfast and the offers the restaurant has are great and cheaper compared to other nearby options. Breakfast however could offer some more options.

We were overall happy with our stay and enjoyed our time!","Excellent service and location is great! This hotel had clean rooms, pool had a swim up bar to seat 3-4 people and was really good value for money 😎 Drinks and food excellent too 🙂","I've stayed here before and was also given this room located back behind the reception area, where it is really dark, dingy and damp and with no natural light. Last time I complained so much that I did not want to stay in one of these awful rooms that they eventually moved me to a different room but insisted I pay more. That is really tricky and disgusting. Anyway, they did it again and it seems to me that this hotel is trying to get of these disgusting rooms first, and anyone who happens to fall for their trick gets stuck with this room. If you complain they tell you that this is the only remaining room in this price range so either you accept it or pay more to ""not"" stay in these rooms.

OK within the bathroom and the bedroom there are damp walls and black mould, I mean lots of black mould. There is no light at all coming in from outside, and the room is in a very depressing location.

My suggestion is strongly to not book at this hotel but look for any one of the much nice hotels further up from Beachwalk where it will be 100x betters and less expensive.

I will never ever stay here again. The management needs to close these rooms permanently and not try to trick guests into staying in these 3 or 4 rooms, and then insisting they pay to change room, it's such a scam.

Black mould matters. It's a serious health threat!!!","plenty choice of breakfast. very polite, nice and friendly staff. the room was a bit small for us since we have kid, but it's clean, and has complete amenities. only one complain, there is no elevators so if your room is on 2nd floor prepare to climb stairs, but good exercise after breakfast. really wanted to swim at their pool but it was always packed. nice stay overall, for the exception the last day when a hoarde of emak2 in yellow shirt occupied the entire breakfast hall."

I like the stay . Location is good.. respectful staffs at lobby and parking.  But really unhappy and felt offensive with the pool manager. My wife took kids to the pool to swim and she was in her swim clothes but was an Islamic swimwear.. but the pool manager didn’t allow her to swim .. he said you need to have a mini suit.. I said we cannot wear due to religious reasons.. but he was adamant and said “then don’t swim.. I have many foreign guests.. they will be unhappy..” really sad with this response.. never expected and have ever experienced such a thing in my life.. I reported this to the lobby but they say will revert within 10 minutes.. waited in the room.. no calls came..

Dear team of Rani hotel, I request you to teach your pool manager to respect other cultures too.. we all pay the same amount.. if you cannot be polite with your guests and see them in different strata according to the country of origin that’s something offensive..
