Beautiful waterfall, a nice pool to swim in and a well set-up dog park and nature walk.

We also had a meal at the pool cafe, it was the best Ayam sambal we have had in Bali and the prices are cheaper than anywhere else we have seen too (55k for each meal).

Worth the 50k entry for international tourists.

Very quiet at the moment due to low season, so good time to visit. The staff are doing small upgrades to the park but it is very clean, tidy and well maintained

Staff are all lovely and friendly too.

Terima Kasih!","After reading the notes from the owner, we thought we would try green gadjah.
Disappointed is the best thing to say. The place is full of potential but we couldn't understand why we were the only ones there. We met our friends who had already arrived. We were told at the gate we had to pay 50k each entrance fee. This is a lot in bali terms. We said we are just meeting friends for lunch. They said it covers the pool and a free drink. Yet we only wanted to eat. The free drink is a tiny bottle of water.
When we got in, we saw our friends with no one else in the venue. I asked them where everyone, and they replied its the high entrance fee that put people off.""
The food was average, but only a third of it was available, such as nasi and pizza.
How to kill what could be a great spot for locals a d tourist. We live in bali so we see many places. This is by far the worst managed place I've seen. Take a look at the video and pictures. I think k you can make up your own minds.","Nice waterfall site easily accessible unlike other waterfalls. Pool, cafe/resto is also on site. Only $3 entrance fee to go all the way down to the waterfall.","Great Dog friendly attraction in Ubud the walk is well laid out with plenty of rest areas the river and waterfall are very unique with landing platforms for photographs from different angles ,the area has a play area for the dogs and the two resident dogs are very welcoming and friendly JoJo the golden retriever and jedi the gorgi, we enjoyed our lunch of fish and chips and nasi goreng special with some very nice passion fruit drinks ,all the staff were super friendly , there is a nice swimming pool that over looks the jungle canopy,and a kids play area ,we will definitely be back",place is very big. nice food. there is a dog park with three adorable dogs. recommended for nature and dog lovers.

And he is great guide for discovering the authentic Bali, traveling by car, motorbike, and  on foot through the rice paddies that start from the house.  What Dewa doesn't know about Bali isn't worth knowing. Fantastic adventure. Top value for money.",Great place to experience How Bali looked like decades ago.
