Our driver has potential pro-photography experience taking cinematic shots and all‚Ä¶ Got to interact with the local community during our drive which was really nice","Amazing experience to do with friends or family! We enjoyed the swings (there are different ones adapted to all ages) and then booked a tour with a vw car. The trip is really nice with jungle and ricefield views and then the driver took us to some authentic places to show us the real Bali (lake with a beautiful temple and an amazing waterfall).
The crew is super nice. A must-do in Bali!
One of our best memories!",Very bad place and the people work here are disrespectful and they took our money for showing us the chocolate and the honey farms but all they did is taking us around with the car! And then when we tried to explain the issue they were ignoring us!!!,"DO NOT GO THERE FOR SWINGS.
If I could give no star to this place I will give . So horrible swings . Most of them are not working. And the one working is full of insects it will directly transfer to your cloths and body. that‚Äôs why no much people doing swings.",Very very bad place it‚Äôs a scam they told you they will do something and then do something and else with no respect for your mind as a costumer!! It‚Äôs a big SCAM

Such beautiful surroundings and lots to do. You can balloon up 25mtrs you can go on the sky swing. Lots of birds nests for you to take that special pic. You can quad bike they also offer rafting. You can chill by the pool.  You won't be dissapointed.,"If you are looking to have an experience of taking hot air balloons, don't go here.  They no longer offer hot air balloons.  But they offer other activities like driving around in vw, swing etc.","Best place to enjoy restaurant food,  extreem swing, take a picture , bird nest, paddyfield and many more.........","Nice place,good service fooddelicious","We tried two of the swings and it was great. Especially the one at the left (single swing). The employees did a great job making me feel I am flying! Great experience if you have additional pocket money. Also tried the juices there, which were delicious."
