We got a nice view and breakfast. Unlimited coffee and tea and the staff were friendly. The minus of this homestay is that the bathroom are a bit far from the room, I needed to go out and walked a bit just to go to the bathroom. Its become annoying because I often go to the bathroom to pee. Also, there were flies everywhere and thats a bit annoying, people say it's because the onions season and rain at the same time.","Very nice place, and the owner organizes trips to the mountain. He drove with me on a motorbike to hot springs pools just to organize a cheaper entrance ticket. Great hospitality, highly recommended to everybody!","Nice place to stay, Clean with good views. best place to stop over before climbing Mt Batur.
Choose rooms appropriately online when booking else the manager will charge high prices for upgrades.
Very good service for breakfast.
Tours available for hike, transport available but expensive as not too many options.","Accommodation is fine but Wang is untrustworthy. He charged 350k, 400k and 650k for different people on the same tour. He also sold the tour as a very different experience to what it was - none of us enjoyed it. He also kept saying bad things behind peoples backs - he said bad things about other groups to us and bad things to other groups about us. Sadly therefore we didn‚Äôt have a good experience and would not recommend this place.",Everythings okay. The owner so welcomed and staff are friendly. Perfect mountains view.

They even offered us free coffee on the next morning. Stores and restaurants are reachable even by walking, cause we had problem with our motorbike and wanted to stock food for the Batur hiking.

Thanks for the good stay!!!",Friendly staff and nice environment. Owner was very friendly and helped us plan the remainder of our trip with recommendations. Ojan and Gerry were very friendly and helped us with transportation. Highly recommended this accommodation for a local experience.,"I felt like my life was threatened by the owner. So i choose to leave rather than to take the fight.

We where three people that had booked an extra night with him directly. When someone else booked online he threw us out.

He got back and was extremly hostil. Even though i had a monotone voice and tried to not escalade it.

He threathened with calling the indonesian president to get immigration to throw me out. And showed a picture of them together.

He put all the blame on us and did not care that we had to find a new option 17:00 in the night.

And he actualy had the nerve to say that we did a late checkout. Even though we agreed on an extra night.

This guy does not feel safe. And i should have listened to the reviews.",Putra and Putu are the GREATEST GUIDES on this entire island. Hostel is super nice and went to Mt Batur in the morning and was UNREAL. Best. Experience. Yet.

Bed was so dirty and wet and floors are also dirty too and too many flies.

My recent stay at this hotel was marked by a regrettable booking error and a disheartening experience with the hotel's management. I unintentionally reserved multiple nights instead of the intended one, but I had discussed this issue with both the staff and the owner before checking in. They initially assured me that an early check-out with a refund for the extra nights was feasible.

Initially, the owner seemed agreeable to the refund arrangement. However, upon my departure, he inexplicably haven‚Äôt received Agoda's refund confirmation emails. Despite numerous attempts to contact him, I was met with silence. This sudden change in behavior raised serious concerns about the owner's honesty and integrity.

In my determination to secure the refund, I returned to the hotel, where I had the opportunity to speak with the owner's nephew. He was polite and attempted to assist me by contacting his uncle, the owner. Shockingly, the owner admitted to receiving the refund email from Agoda but claimed ignorance on how to confirm the refund. This was a clear indication that the owner had no intention of processing my refund, despite the earlier agreement.

Furthermore, the hotel‚Äôs entrance left much to be desired, with a rough and unsafe road leading to it. The hotel‚Äôs remote mountain location made it nearly impossible to find dining options at night, and the nearby restaurants, including the hotel‚Äôs own, were exorbitantly overpriced.

In the end, I had to collaborate with Agoda to resolve the dispute with the hotel owner, and thankfully, I did eventually receive my refund. I write this review as a warning to potential guests. Please exercise caution when considering this hotel, given the service issues and the owner's apparent reluctance to fulfill agreed-upon refunds.","Im really dispointing for this place , i have booked for 1 month ago , i think will be nice and comfortable, but the real all is fake ,

This was our worst Experience in Bali. Not only that the owner tries to sell you a guide for mt batur and lies about the regulations (it is not necessary to go there with a guide), there were also rats in our room and rat droppings on our bed. When we wanted to leave, we were assured to get our money back, but we never got it. After many attempts to contact the owner over the booking platform, he just insulted us and told us we will never see the money again.

The place looks unmaintained, and while I was in the parking lot, I was just swarmed by a lot of flies, and when I say a lot it was a lot, like around 50 or sth. I tried to get my booking info to call the contact but the signal/phone reception was so bad there, I couldn't connect to the internet. So I finally gave up and leave, I just cannot wait by being swarmed by the flies.

The owner and staff were incredibly helpful, arranging a rental car for a dinner at a floating restaurant, organizing a corn grill, and arranging a jeep sunrise trip. Since the swimming pool being under construction, the owner took us to a nearby hot spring facility. The only minor issue was the narrow access to the villa.","We had a really nice stay at Lingga Bali. The owner did everything for us, he arranged a motorbike, a hike on the Batur, a taxi, and he solved a problem with the broken showerhead at our room. The breakfast and dinner were good.

When we were there, the location was super hot. It feels like we're at Denpasar. The night temperature was fine, I mean we're at Kintamani after all, but damn we're baked in our tent at daylight. Also too bad our 3 years old toddler can't enjoy running and walking around because we're at the edge of the cliff. This place is for real intended to adult with no children around. Still a lovely place though.","My best¬†camping experience¬†was @kayupadi_sunrise

Location:
üìçKintamani, Bali. It's about 2 hours by motorbike to Tabanan or Denpasar. It's an easily accessible camp site.

Service:
The owners of the camp are so friendly and helpful with everything we need. The toilets were all maintained.

Atmosphere:
The camping site is very close to the Mount and the Lake Batur which is amazing. Can be very very windy.

Synopsis:
Beautiful place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for the weekends. Quiet and relaxing just enjoy a peaceful walk. Great place for all ages.

A note:
Ensure you book before arriving at the campsite. Be mindful that booking are only made online and you can't just show up and get a camp.","Good place bad experience.

The good things  :
- Yes, you don‚Äôt need to bring any tent (they set it up for you too), firewood, mattress, cause you can rent it there at reasonable price. But, you do need to bring any sleeping bag if you can‚Äôt handle the cold.
- There is a clean toilet and running water even tho It‚Äôs a bit far if you have uncontrollable bladder.
- There is a nearby Warung (to buy some snacks, noodle, or coffee perhaps?)
- The owner (or someone who‚Äôs in charge?) is so polite. My friend broke their hammock and they are not charging us for the damage. The people
- The view is amazing! Even it is night or day. It is so good vibes for you to bond with your friend and the nature while cooking some food or staying by the bonfire and have a chit chat.

So what about the bad?
- The road to go there isn‚Äôt as good as it seems. My scooter tire got sucked up in the road. But they told me, the road will be fixed in a month or so. It is not recommended for people who are new to riding a motorcycle.
- There‚Äôs some campers who still play their music through the speaker in full blast. Which is making me stay awake till the sun is rising. Well done!

Other than that? Nothing. And I recommend you, to take your turn now to camp there, and I hope my badluck won‚Äôt come to you."

The view is amazing, and most importantly the staff are so friendly and accommodating. Since there are no grabs in Batur, they personally drove me to the main hot springs. They also arranged a guide for me to depart for the hike at the exact time I wanted (i.e. several hours after all the tourists go in the middle of the night). I highly recommend the grilled fish. It was SO FRESH. Clearly just out of the lake. It gets chilly at night, so the cozy camp fire and super hot shower water are key. No complaints.","Bang for buck!

Katut is the best, he is so kind and will make sure your stay is very chill. He makes u feel welcome.

If you need a swim you can make use of the pool at the warung below which is owned by his brother. Just mention you are staying at the panorama view cottage.

We had a lovely stay at this place and for the big climb you get out bed around 03:15 and then the climb start at 04:00 at the foot of the mountain with your own private guide arranged by Katut, his good friend with guide you up the mountain and it was absolutely worth it.

The food at their warung is nice too. Lovely breakfast and good rice and vegan options if you like.

Only downside it that there is a lot of noise. This whole village is based on tourism that will go up the mountain, the noises of the jeeps, dirtbikes, barking dogs. All day and night long. So don‚Äôt expect a silent stay.

We booked 2 nights, climbed the hill, rent a scooter via Ketut and explored the museum a bit further and do a hotspring. Thats around everything you can do. So keep that in mind.","We had a great stay at Bunbulan Panorama. The rooms are very nice and the views are excellent. A very nice place to explore Kintamani, especially mt. Batur and surroundings.

What made the stay even better is the great level of service that Ketut and his staff offer. He constantly went out of his way to accommodate our needs. The kindest person we've met in Bali on our visit.

Thanks Ketut and Bunbulan Panorama for making our stay memorable ‚ù§Ô∏è","The space is beautiful, I would definitely recommend that you stay here! There's a great little resto that had nice fresh food for a cheap price, they were able to accommodate my vegan choice, complimentary tea and coffees, also complimentary water refill (great for saving plastic). The view is 10/10! At night there is a bit of noise coming from the valley so if you are a light sleeper I would just recommend to bring some earplugs, (this is no fault of the host, just the way of the area). There's a few places on this hill, and I'm so glad I picked this one, it was definitely the best location. It was great value for money, I would definitely stay here again.

Ketut and his family are absolutely kind and welcomed us very warmly, with great attentiveness. The communication was very easy too.
The room and bathroom were very clean, there‚Äôs hot water, which is awesome considering the temperature that can drop easily being that high.
From the bed and terrace you get the perfect view to the Mount Batur,.
You can also get a trekking to see the sunrise from the top. There are some other activities to do like visiting a coffee plantation and the hot springs.

They will make sure you have an awesome time!!

We recommend fully to stay here! It it‚Äôs the best accommodation you can find around. Without any doubt.

Thank you very much for this.","Apartment:

The apartment we lived in was amazing. We had an amazing nice view and we were able to see the mount batur, the mount abang and the batur lake out of bed.

Wc:

The wc was small but very nice. You had everything you need, including warm water.

Cleanness:

The apartment was very clean and the staff was so sweet to clean every day, sometimes  even multiple times.

Environment:

The environment is very nice, especially the view that I‚Äôve already described. You‚Äôll have to keep in mind you‚Äôre basically living in nature, so there might be roommates like spiders, snails, mosquitos and lots of flies. But since they clean up so good, it didn‚Äôt bother us at all.

Since the apartment is on a hill, the way up is obviously kind of adventurous. But if you‚Äôve got a motorbike you‚Äôll get up and down pretty easily.

This place isn‚Äôt as touristic, which definitely has its benefits. But it also means you don‚Äôt have that many restaurants/ caf√©s around and we didn‚Äôt find an ATM accepting European visa (but most restaurants including Ketut‚Äôs accept payment via visa card), so keep that in mind and be prepared.

Conclusion:

In conclusion we really enjoyed our stay at Ketuts apartment. He and the staff were really nice. There was someone around 24/7, and they were always very helpful when we had any questions. The tour to the mount batur that Ketut organized for us was great, they were really nice, had food and water prepared for us and took some amazing pictures.

The electricity was turned off, we have no lights, no water and no one to be contacted!! 3. There was no one around sells food! We were starving eventhough they have a small cafe inside! You need car or bike to find something to eat! 4. The owner itself didnt pick up our phone call! Pathetic attitude!
5. It is relatively far away from mount batur, the problem was, if you drive a car, the road is not really wide enough. It is better find a guest house located on the opposite of this place. 6. I was taking bath with a bloody cold water! Imagine it! It is cold enough when you are living under the mountain. Taking bath at night with coldwater in this place is something else!!"

The vegetables were not fresh. Sad experience.","Meh, food was ok, grilled bananas were more mashed and soup was a little salty but all in all was ok. Service was fast and was quiet. Do not go for lunch, flies are too bad","Nice place to sit, and they had few vegan /veg options too.","The food was delicious and inexpensive, with a nice selection of food from an extensive menu, serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Service was swift and kind, being served from Ketut who was friendly and helpful.

Thanks a lot for having us we will remember our stay for a long time!","Alam Bali lake view is a scam! These amazing photos are stolen from Batur Cliff Panorama guest house further up the hill. We were very disappointed when we arrived, because the rooms and views were nothing like in the google photos. The description in agoda is also incorrect, Akam Bali lake view has small beds and does not contain a sofa.","Clean room. Nice view. Perfect service.
Love their hospitality and their ginger tea.
There is a tracking way to see sunrise or sunset, hence you need to prepare a nice shoes since it is a bit slippery.","We had a really good night in this hotel ! They treated us like king, made us a fire and went pick us some food. We had good chat with them and we organized a trip with them for batur and it was really  good. Nice people there and the room are very comfy ! I recommend it","Stay here with my friends, view from the villa was amazing. We can see 3 mountains at once (Mt. Batur, Mt. Abang, and Mt. Agung). Only 10 minutes trekking from the villa we can see the beauty of rice fields scenery. However, the most memorable experience from this place is the hospitality from the villa owner.

The people who own the place and work here are the most welcoming and heartwarming people. They made us so welcomed like we were family. As soon as we arrived we got chatting and was offered a welcome drink which of course we chose Bali coffee. Gery was excellent. For the moment we started to chat to him it was like we have known him for years. He helped us in so many ways. The owner brought us on a beautiful tour up Mt. Batur at 4am in his 4√ó4 to watch the sunrise, offering breakfast when we got there and then we headed to the black lava field. Truely an amazing experience. His wife was always busy working but she always had a smile of her face and would offer us something to drink with biscuits which we loved.
