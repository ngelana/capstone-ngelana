We ordered 2 dishes: fried duck and grilled one. Both taste amazing and tender. However, the sauces were a bit too spicy for us. The staff was very nice to us and helpful. The restaurant has many nice decorations with a peaceful atmosphere. I highly recommend this place for all the tourists. The restaurant receives the last order at 9pm.","Nestled amidst Bali's verdant landscapes, Bebek Tepi Sawah Ubud stands out as a culinary gem. During my recent visit, I was captivated by the restaurant's expansive grounds and the picturesque view of the surrounding rice fields. The ambiance seamlessly blends traditional Balinese architecture with modern comforts, creating a serene yet vibrant atmosphere that sets the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.

The highlight of my evening was undoubtedly the signature Fried Duck dish. Cooked to perfection, the duck was tender, succulent, and bursting with flavor. Paired with fragrant rice and an array of Balinese condiments, each bite offered a tantalizing journey through Indonesia's rich culinary heritage. With its diverse menu and impeccable service, Bebek Tepi Sawah Ubud exceeds expectations, making it a must-visit destination for anyone seeking an extraordinary dining adventure in Bali.","Thought we try this restaurant out since we had eaten this many years ago. The premises look larger now with accommodation available next door.

We chose to sit on the floor, careful if you are not used to sitting on the floor you might want to ask for a table with chairs instead.

We ordered sate lilit, Bebek Tepi Sawah (fried duck) and tempe tauhu(tofu). The duck still tastes the same as I had remembered it. Crispy and flavourful! Gotta eat with the chilli,it makes all the difference.

Check out the video and see if you are able to spot the duckiesü§£","Came specially for the crispy duck. It was crispy but more on the dry side. We had a same dish in another restaurant in Ubud the night before and the duck was crispy and juicy. So a bit of a let down.

The grilled duck with some sauce was much better. We thoroughly enjoyed this dish.

The fried fish was good but the topping was just super spicy. Had to remove all the topping, but ended up enjoying the fish.

Prices are on the high side.
Not sure if I‚Äôll return.

Satay was flavourful and delicious.","Bebek Tepi Sawah Restaurant in Ubud was an exceptional dining experience that exceeded our expectations! We went specifically for the duck dishes, but the restaurant's stunning rice farm setting was a delightful surprise.

The kids enjoyed their chicken dishes, while the duck we ordered was cooked to perfection. We were seated overlooking charming small bridges and lush plants, making the setting both tranquil and picturesque.

The service was attentive and professional. While waiting for our meals, we explored the beautiful surroundings and admired the different dining areas, each offering a unique view of the gardens and rice paddies.

We indulged in fresh mango juice, chicken skewers, and perfectly grilled and deep-fried duck‚Äîeach dish was delicious! We are so glad we listened to local recommendations and chose this restaurant.

Our driver patiently waited for us during our 2-hour meal, enjoying a well-deserved break with other drivers he knew. The restaurant is only a short 15-20 minute drive from our hotel, making it convenient to visit.

Bebek Tepi Sawah Restaurant offers great value for the quality of its duck and chicken dishes, and we highly recommend it for a memorable dining experience!

The parking is at the front and you walk up to the back where the restaurant is located. There is also a museum you can enjoy which we didn‚Äôt do, we think it may have been closed.

We had dessert elsewhere, but did read that dessert is worth it here. Either way, dinner with the surrounding view was perfect."

I brought my 1-year-old son with me. Our room was called Ubud Cottage. We couldn‚Äôt add a single bed because the room was already full of furniture, but that was fine since my baby sleeps with me in the bed. I loved the concept of the open bathroom, and we enjoyed relaxing in the bathtub at night. The room service was excellent, and all the staff were very friendly.

The downside is that the resort is in a somewhat forested area, and with the open-air bathroom, we had to keep the room door closed because there were a lot of mosquitoes. Initially, I was worried we wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep, so I bought mosquito spray at Alfamart. We slept fine at night. Another issue was ants falling from the roof. The roof seemed to be made of some kind of thatch or palm leaves, and ants would fall onto the bed from above. To prevent this, I draped the bed‚Äôs canopy over the top, and it worked well.

Despite the mosquitoes and ants, these were not major problems for me. I still rate this place a 5 because of the environment. ü´∂üèª","I am very happy that I chose this place to spend my first time in Bali. All of the staff were very nice and helpful. The entire resort is beautiful and well maintained. The main public pool is located at the end/bottom of the resort with views out into the jungle. It was very quiet and it felt peaceful. One would not think you were in the heart of Ubud. The private pool villa was also amazing. The ac was cold, the bed was big and comfy and there was plenty of hot water. We spent a significant amount of time playing in the pool and ordering room service! I could not have asked for a better room or service from the staff.","Stayed at Amarea Resort Ubud. Beautiful villa and super nice staff! A tranquil place far from the big city. Every morning, we wake up to roosters crowing. Can see cows n rice paddies outside our resort.

We chose the one bedroom pool villa. It was so pretty! The pool is big enough to have a swim too. The soap and shampoo provided smell so nice. Will stay again! :)","Stayed alone at one of the cottages and it was fantastic. I got a welcome drink for booking directly through their website. The breakfast options were also pretty good.

It‚Äôs a quiet resort with minimal noise/traffic. The design is very modern and aesthetically pleasing.

Rooms were spacious and clean. Bed was firm but comfortable.

Outdoor bathroom meant showers and baths out in nature which feels so good. BUT, also means you are exposed to all the elements and mosquitoes when you want to use the bathroom at night. Could be easily fixed with a fly screen above the door that guests can choose to put down or not.

Also, location is close to the action but not great. You mostly have to hire a scooter to get anywhere.","Truly 5 star service. Their staff assisted with everything we needed very professionally. They seem to have noted my wife's birthday from her passport during check-in and came to our room with a birthday cake to surprise us. This is really attention to the detail.
Room is also very modern and has all amenities you need.
Can highly this hotel to anyone going to Ubud."

There's very limited seating if you want to sit near the pickup truck. Yes they're selling from a pickup truck. There's a small terrace that you can sit on the floor nearby.

It is a local hangout spot/food van in a parking lot so don't expect any fancy dining, local dogs may join ur dinner. Having said that the servers were wearing gloves and professional.

The taste of the meat and crackling is really mild paired with white rice it's almost bland, till u hit the condiments which bring the whole dish to life a little bit. Main taste was cassava and beans, not too salty or porky taste.
Disclaimer: I am not sure what the dish is exactly meant to taste like.","Definitely should try if you in the area. It‚Äôs in the parking lot/market, they selling it from their car. You can dine in tho, sitting on some spots they provided. Price is cheap and drink is included. Taste is as good as the famous ones.","Babi Guling Paket Spesial + Minum costs 35k. This is the most expensive item on the menu. I chose Es Teh as my beverage (minum).

Must try!","A nice suckling pig (babi guling) seller on a food truck, located in alun-alun (town square) of Peliatan Ubud, open only in the evening, starting at 8pm.
Well-organized with a good system, there is a specific person/people in charge in each position of cashier, cook, waitress/waiter. Also, they use POS cashier system leading to the quick queue so customers don't have to wait for a long time, both for dine-in or takeaway.

The curry lacks the rich, aromatic spices and depth typically expected from a good chicken curry. The consistency of the sauce was also thinner than usual, and it didn't have the creamy texture that makes a curry comforting and flavorful. Overall, it was disappointing and not worth the price given the lack of robust flavor and depth.

I don't recommend you order this dish at all. The underwhelming taste and texture make it a poor choice, especially considering the additional charges. Save your money for a more satisfying option.","Ordered the ""seafood laksa"" after thinking the service was going to be 5 star

What I received was instant noodles noodles and a soup so thin you can feed it to a hospital patient.

No sense of any base for a laksa
The food is in fact at a premium, and not cheap in comparison with relative cafes even in the centre of Ubud itself.

Upon requesting for an exchange, the staff was audibly gossiping with the kitchen regarding the dissatisfaction, and was highly unprofessional.

Totally did not feel welcome or comfortable at this establishment at all afterwards.
Super disappointed as we were staying nearby and was hoping to patronise this establishment a lot more in the future.

I hope the experience for other visitors are different, but if not, let my experience be a word of caution.

Edit: I thought it couldn't get worse but it seems like in general the Chef was incapable of handling the menu and the dishes within.
The replacement dish of rendang was leaking a thin juice and did not even have any sauce associated with the traditional rendang.
I will attach a photo for reference.","Delicious and beautiful!

Delicious and not expensive. You can eat with a beautiful view of the rice fields. I recommend it!",If you like a quite ambience to spend here is the place. You can see the rice paddies in front of your face with enjoying your drink and meals! So nice.

The hosts were incredibly friendly, accommodating, and kind, creating a warm and homey atmosphere. Surrounded by rivers and greenery, the location was serene. I met wonderful fellow travelers, and the hosts showed exceptional support when one had to extend her stay due to an emergency. The rooms were spacious, offering great value for the price, and the breakfast options were both delicious and varied. Highly recommend this haven for a peaceful and welcoming stay.","Everything was lovely! We stayed for almost 1 month and it felt like home. Sukma and his mother Madi are very nice and were there if we needed anything. Room was spacious, cleaning service anytime we needed. Beds were comfy. The garden is absolutely beautiful and the sunsets spectacular. We also had the chance to participate to a balinese celebration and wear traditional clothes provided by them. An authentic experience for sure! Also, close to many warungs, 25min walk to the center and rice fields. Truly recommend.","The best guest house in Ubud. It‚Äôs so peaceful, you hear nothing but crickets, it‚Äôs beautiful. The view is incredible and the beds are so comfortable. Breakfast is so fresh and yummy, with the choice of pancakes, scrambled eggs etc. and gets brought to your door every morning. Staff are also so welcoming and helpful. 100% recommend","The accommodation was really nice for the price. Besides a private bathroom with shower, a double bed with mosquito net, air conditioning and Wi-Fi, there is breakfast included. You can choose between scrambled eggs, omelettes and pancakes and there is fresh fruit and coffee or tea. The owners are really nice and the accommodations are clean. For the price really unbeatable.  You can also have your laundry done for cheap and rent a scooter through the accommodation. Highly recommended for those who want to travel low budget.
And a nice view on top in you take the rooms upstairs.",Best accomodation in Ubud! The food is rich and the hosts are very welcoming. They are unconditionally show about their culture and How they live! Definitely I would rebook it!

Very impressed with how clean and luxurious it was. The service was really good. We even had a spa massage in our room that we reserved through the hotel. The only downside is that we had to park a little further away because the villa doesn‚Äôt have a parking lot on site which was unfortunate as it stated that they did during the booking. I definitely recommend it. Our stay here was great.,"My stay at Sawah Villas was taken care by Nano & staff, who were both attentive and accommodating to my schedule and needs.

The villa is slightly further in, roughly a 5-10 min walk out to the main street. However it is extremely peaceful and quiet with a view of rice paddy fields right from the room.

Despite the outdoor bathroom being close to the lobby of the compound, the villas provide a very private space with only 2 neighbouring villas.

As for the included breakfast, I strongly recommend the banana pancakes. They are simply delicious.

Overall, I highly recommend staying at Sawah Villas while in Ubud!","Amazing hospitality. Loved our stay. Great staff, breakfast amazing. Lovely room. Definitely Recommend","Loved our stay here! Just outside central Ubud, it was a quick grab (taxi) ride into downtown for anything we wanted to do or see. Ubud is quite a bustling spot so it was great to be away from the chaos. Beautiful views overlooking the rice fields with views of cranes flying throughout the early morning. The pool was perfect and there was a great amount of shade and sunshine throughout the day. The hosts are absolutely lovely and helped with anything we needed.","Wonderful place to enjoy the beauty of Ubud.

Excellent vibes, relaxation and interesting encounters.
Highly recommended",A lovely guesthouse to stay in. Quiet and very affordable for the backpacker. Dorm room also available. My only disappointment was that I booked a room with AC but I didn‚Äôt get a room with AC. Check before booking. The owner will rent you a scooter at a great price too.

My partner and i stayed on the second floor and had no issues with the usual bugs. There were minuscule ants roaming around that like to sneak into your open drinks and food but we kept everything sealed in plastic bags.

Rooms are spacious and clean. The shower is heaven.

Every single person working there is so wonderful like you‚Äôre walking into your family‚Äôs home.

Great stay. Thank you üôè","To be honest, our stay here wasn‚Äôt planned. We were planning to stay at the other accommodation located on the same street (it was a beautiful street and looks like a housing complex but filled with guesthouses instead of just residential homes), but they turned out to be full. Then we asked around and stumbled upon this amazing hidden gem!

For 250k/night, it gives you such a great value for money. The room looks new, very clean, spacious, well-lit, bed feels comfy with clean good quality linens and fluffy pillows. I didn‚Äôt find any dusty spots inside the room. AC working perfectly and they even use Daikin, which is what usually used in higher rates hotels.

Bathroom was clean and HUGE! üòÇ Hot water working very properly. Water pressure is good. Towels and floor mat looks clean and new. Smells good too! They also provide shower gel, shampoo and handsoap. The bathroom design might be simple, but I love how they choose to play a little with the ceiling, because it totally gives quite a lot of difference.

There is no TV in the room, but it‚Äôs not a problem at all for us, since we don‚Äôt watch TV on our daily basis.

They provided water dispenser on each floor where you can refill your bottles for free. There is a refrigerator too in the common area if you need it.

The property has a small pool with a small beautiful garden, tho‚Äô we didn‚Äôt try to swim there. But just by looking at the clear water, I can say that it‚Äôs properly maintained.

Last but not least, the host is SUPER FRIENDLY! It feels like you coming to your old friend‚Äôs place for a sleep over.üòÇ

It‚Äôs 10/10 for me, I was super happy to find and stayed in Saka House. I hope they will at least maintain their services to this standard or even keep getting better.

Delicious breakfast and they also have a laundry service, which is paid extra by the guest if used. Room service daily.

The only thing that was a bit annoying was that the sound isolation was not very good, meaning I would sometimes wake up at 6:30am when I wanted to wake up at 9:00am because there was loud and constant talking or constant arguing heard that would not stop for at least 20 minutes.

Overall the guest house is a really good place to stay, if you wake up at an early time in your holiday.","We had a wonderful stay at Cahaya Guest House! Everything was great!

So glad we made the 15-minute journey out of the centre of Ubud to support this community theatre dedicated to preserving traditional Balinese dance and music. We were privileged to have virtually a private showing - just our family, 2 other tourists and a few local kids sitting quietly at the back. Broken into 6 acts the performance gave us a great taste of different styles of dance and insight into Balinese storytelling encapsulating events from as far back as the 12th century. The dancers and musicians were extremely skilled and clearly committed to their practice. A really fun, engaging experience - we couldn‚Äôt believe 90 minutes had passed. It was easy to book seats via WhatsApp and pay at the door. Balerung Stage is tucked away behind the royal palace in Peliatan but the theatre sent us a map when we booked and our driver knew how to find it - definitely worth paying the extra 150k to get there and giving the commercial events in the centre of Ubud a miss!","Located in the heart of Ubud, this stage offers the audience serenity and privacy. It is an indoor stage and there aren't many audience so it feels like a personalized experience. Weather wouldn't be much of a trouble.

The dancers are amazing and the maestro/director himself, Anak Agung Gede Oka, would also join the line up.","The gamelan player mostly old man, same with the dancers.",Very different and enjoyable show.
