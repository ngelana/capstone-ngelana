I will definitely come back again and highly recommend this place if you‚Äôre coming to Sideman.

I can‚Äôt wait to come back again in the near future.,"A piece of paradise in Bali‚Äôs most authentic area called Sidemen. Everything about this resort makes me happy! The food, the staff, the rooms. Taking affordable luxury to the next level I would definitely recommend staying here and already have been back twice!","Firstly I must mention the incredible staff , they are polite, friendly chatty and really make you feel welcome.
Breathtaking accommodation outstanding views and accommodation just stunning aesthetics, every aspect is wonderful, friendly helpful welcoming staff, stunning rooms and areas. The restaurant and bar serving delicious food breakfast is wonderful and lastly the amazing therapists in the spa highly recommend this accommodation in the unspoilt area of sidemen.","Mostly enjoyed our stay. I was a bit turned off by the Man at the front desk who notably spoke English very well and enunciated his words super clearly but he was a very unhelpful and not  service oriented and had a bit of an attitude. Example: he asked for our passports which we told him were in our luggage but he did not offer to help bring in our luggage but expected us to deliver our passports which meant we had to carry our luggage in. He suggested using the mosquito netting in the room and When he showed us to our room I realized why. I noticed that the door between the bedroom and outdoor attached bathroom did not close snugly and had 2 large gaps thus an entrance for mosquitoes. Once he again was not very helpful. Ultimately a woman manager came and we solved the issue by putting mosquito netting around the bathroom door. Applause to her. She was lovely and helpful. She also gave my daughter lots of suggestions of things to do in the area. Other than a slight attitude from the male front desk person, our stay was enjoyable after the mosquito netting was put in place. I had a nice swim. Dinner and breakfast were very tasty. Setting was very nice. Room was a nice size. Overall a good experience"

The staff are very nice and very punctual üëç we stayed at the owl house and mosquitoes were not a problem for us (the villa has mosquito repellent and mosquito lamp). Overall a great experience!","""A paradise in Bali""

Our stay at Veluvana was simply unforgettable! The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating which made our stay really enjoyable. The location of the hotel is simply stunning - surrounded by tropical beauty and overlooking the rice fields.

We enjoyed every moment of our stay and can highly recommend the Veluvana- definitely one of the best Bamboo houses in Bali!","What an incredible experience! A one-of-a-kind bamboo house in the middle of beautiful Sidemen Village.

The scenery is so serene and gorgeous. We were speechless at the scenery and architecture. We enjoy the pool on top of Octopus House. We liked the stunning night view from our bed. In the morning, we ate breakfast while watching the sun rise. The food was delicious, particularly the banana pancakes and lemongrass tea.

We even booked a photo session to capture our beautiful moment here. Ari was amazing. If you guys are looking for a talented photographer in Bali, you can book him or see his work at @aripratama_putu.

The entire staff was fantastic; they were all really polite and helpful throughout our stay.

We'll definitely be back.","We had a wonderful time staying in Manta House for 4 days/3nights.  At the end of the trip, we had the pleasure to visit the Owl and Scorpio houses and there were equally beautiful. This is an eco-lodge, in my view, with 5 houses passionately designed in different theme. The property married nature, with bamboo-theme architectural design, and modern infrastructure (by that I mean great wifi connection). There will be bugs, mosquitoes, some lovely salamanders, adorable praying mantis, and lovely nature sounds. It will be hot, it‚Äôs a tropical country but windy at the same time. But that is exactly what I signed up for. My urban husband love it and agree that we can go back to experience staying in the other houses but I already have my eyes on Scorpio. If you are looking for fully aircon, luxurious sofa, then this is not your resort. We love lying in the bed with all the curtains open up and the transparent roof giving a dome view of outside. Love the hanging hammock over the pool with breezing lazy wind. The skyline was lit up by lightning sparkling periodically for more than an hour in our last night. It was beautiful watching them.

The staff are friendly, polite and very helpful. The menu is restricted but you can always Grab food or cook some wholesome instant noodles. I have tweak the menu a few times and the staff was very accommodating and responsive as well as punctual. Was everything perfect? Of course not-it‚Äôs a property facing the open element but it was nothing that we cannot accept and that the staff could not solve for us.

Overall, a very enjoyable and interesting stay. Great for a quiet retreat and  honeymoon.","We choose the Veluvana because we would like to have a special experience sleeping in a high level open air space. Each villa is like an art, the decoration is really unique. For sure it‚Äôs something more than special!! You have to be prepared that from all the outside nature noises maybe you can not sleep all night but it‚Äôs an open air room so it‚Äôs normal. Also there are many mosquito and small bugs that can pass the bed nest and wakes you up many many times. Also, we had massage in room but the women didn‚Äôt have massage bed‚Ä¶so she asked me to lay down at the bed‚Ä¶it was uncomfortable‚Ä¶also there were so many small bugs in my body so I couldn‚Äôt enjoy it.For me the most important thing is that there is no security in the night. After 21:00 no body is at the property and you feel totally unsafe even if Sidemen is a quiet area. All the villas are open and any body can just jump in front of your bed.(also don‚Äôt forget that the price of the accommodation for the bali rates is really high, so a security or 24h front desk must be available). Also from the photos the property looks like more private but it‚Äôs not as there are many other accommodations just behind so every body can hear you or look at you (every body can pass from the rice field in front of your villa).Another negative was the breakfast as it was below the average. Also, our swimming pool wasn‚Äôt so clean. Additionally I would say that the staff wasn‚Äôt so friendly as they were acting more like robots than like a warm welcome. Also, if you wanna use your drone you had to take the permition of the staff(they said that they will
Ask the rest of the guests and if they were ok with that we could flight it‚Ä¶but when the other guests flew there drones no body asked for our permission!)
Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt enjoy our stay to Veluvana at all. We had more expectations. We will not recommend it or stay again as after so many years travelling in Bali we had visited really more beautiful places with lower (or higher) prices but for sure more enjoyable!"

We had the 2-storey villa with own pool which was very comfortable. Amazing setting and a beautiful outlook.

Breakfast was ok, 5 set options, I enjoyed the ‚Äòhealthy breakfast‚Äô which was porridge plus fruit and granola/nuts.

While the resort is well designed and staff are very nice the speed of service, attention to detail, customer focus was just a bit below par. Food adequate but not as good (and more expensive) than the many warungs nearby.

Recommend 9:00am coffee next door for great coffee and excellent dinners.","We moved to this hotel recommended  by  Sandra, who we met  while we were taking a nice walk in the rice fields.
The resort is beautiful and the staff are very professional and kind.
We stayed at a villa with a private swimming pool and it was great.
The resort offers a great breakfast .
While we were there, there was a mask dance at dinner time, which was very interesting.
The wife worked great as well as A/c.
The views at the resort are amazing.
The resort is in a great location, close to many restaurants.
I would recommend to anyone to stay here during their visit to wonderful Sidemen.","Amazing, would recommend for relaxation and visiting local landmarks (waterfalls, temples, rice terraces). Best feature: the wonderful staff - always happy, friendly and taking care of all the guests. We especially enjoyed chatting with Yusi at breakfast.","Fantastic little resort.

Thank you for this beautiful stay.","The location of the hotel is good and the jungle setting is unique. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was really nice. However, the air conditioning in the room is more of a fan. If you stand directly in front of it you can feel the cool air but the room itself didn‚Äôt feel cool even after a long time.
Also booked a massage at 4pm which is right by the pool, half way through 25-30 teenage children turned up to use the pool and were very noisy. I was told afterwards they let the local school kids use the pool from time to time which is fine but they should pre-warn people because it isn‚Äôt exactly relaxing.
Overall ok place to stay for 1 night.","The family that own the homestay are absolutely lovely! So kind and welcoming.

Sadly though, I couldn‚Äôt understand the overwhelmingly positive reviews.

I understand that you‚Äôre in a jungle location, but the amount of bugs and mosquitoes in our room was too much! The trouble is, the doors and ceiling have so many gaps for the critters to get in. We also had a very large gecko in the room with us. Again, the family were so helpful, but it just doesn‚Äôt make for a very relaxing stay! There was a mosquito net, but this was very torn and dirty. The whole room was also just not very clean. There was a duvet, but this had no cover on it? So I‚Äôm not sure if the whole duvet is being being cleaned after each guest? We found 2 plug sockets in the room but the one near the bed wouldn‚Äôt work so we had to share the one that the fan was also plugged into (no air con!). We also ordered some food from them. It was very much undercooked and I didn‚Äôt eat it. It is nice to be in nature, but I do feel like maybe they‚Äôre letting it take over a bit! The pool water was very murky and again, the whole pool area was not very clean.

Be aware that there is no Grab/Gojek/Bluebird in the Sidemen area. They can drop off but aren‚Äôt allowed to pick up. Not their fault, but worth noting as it‚Äôs very difficult to arrange local taxi drivers for short journeys around Sidemen.

Such a shame as the family are so lovely and clearly take pride in what they do! But for me that just couldn‚Äôt make up for all of the above.","Very nice place and super nice people, the service is excellent. Defenitly I'll be back with Pinpin and his amazing family, thanks for everything!! Humberto and Rita :)","A great place to stay. Cozy and comfortable. Owners are really friendly and nice. All requests we had were resolved in the best way possible. There is a good pool, a small laundge and several bungalows on the territory. It's clean, peaceful and quet.

During the night you can hear the rice fields with geckos, rain, wind - I found it special and beautiful.
The hotel offers a variety of activities, we chose the tracking: saw places we would have never found by ourselves and learned a lot about agriculture and culture in general here. The view was magical.
The restaurant and the pool at the hotel were also very nice!",Very authentic place to stay. The hotel is surrounded by (corn or rice?)fields with the farmers working. But... this implies that you constantly have smoke smell from burning fires and that you are waken up very early in the morning by farmers hammering on metal plates to scare away the birds that eat the seeds. My room was not very clean (especially bathroom walls). The restaurant was a bit below average in this category. The service provided by hotel crew is (as usual in Bali) very good. The massage in the Spa was great.,"If I have to use one word to describe this place it would have to be serenity.  Make sure not to bring your significant other if you don't like them very much.  If there was a TV in the room, I haven't  noticed.  I was taken by the mountains backdrop and incredibly beautiful tropical nature.  I have also had dinner and breakfast at the restaurant, both were good.  There is free parking as well.

Despite the open bathroom, I haven't noticed any bugs in the room or even the bathroom.  The room, sheets, and towels were clean.  No complaints there.  I have added a video tour if you're interested.

If you want to ponder life, or your upcoming 5 years plan, I can't think of a better place!",Great place somewhat off the beaten path. Our room didn‚Äôt have blackout curtains so we had the sun wake us up around 6.30AM until we slept with sleeping masks. Breakfast overlooking the rice fields is absolutely fantastic. I recommend getting a massage here at the spa!,"Great stay and amazing service. The staff were wonderful. The breakfast and juice were delicious. The pool is nice. Highly recommend.

The bathroom needs a good scrub. The spar is questionable which I wouldn't recommend."

One of the best places I‚Äôve been in Bali. The villa is like your home because it‚Äôs not empty, there‚Äôs everything you need except food. The only disadvantage is that on the second floor (I guess it depends on the season) you‚Äôre a bit exposed, locals working on the fields like to watch by you üòÇ like you‚Äôre a fish in aquarium","Interesting stay here. From most of the rooms, on a clear day, it's an unreal view of the volcano. Seriously, it's special. That's what makes this place surrounded by rice paddies.

The accommodations are really mixed. The best way to explain is that they are rustic. It's a good rustic, with a few oddities. For example, the bed is solid/hard, with mosquito net, and it's generally open to the elements - cool! On the other hand, most of the light switches in the bathroom are filthy, ran of of soap on day two, things are definitely warn, e.g. furniture - not so cool. You'll find droppings from flying objects the next morning about. No big deal.

The service in general was great except for one person who is leaving the place in the next week.

Breakfast is really weak, but passable.

For me the place is kinda mixed. I really want to like it, because that view is stunning, but it really could use a touch more of an update inside to be incredible.

You can see my 360 images for more info.",I was initially hesitant to book this home-stay style hotel but I'm sooo glad we did. Our 'deluxe' room was very clean and the views to Mount Agung were absolutely outstanding (even from the bed). The grounds are beautiful and the infinity pool is a welcome relief from the heat. The staff are lovely and are happy to help organise whatever you need. Breakfast is basic but enough. There are multiple restaurants and a small shop (for water/beer/snacks) within walking distance. We will definitely come back.,"We stayed in Kubu Tani for 4 nights during our stay at Sidemen. Kubu Tani truly was a great choice. The best things about this accommodation was an amazing view to Mount Agung, great service and versatile service offering (dining option, massage service, scooter rental, etc.)

Kubu Tani is located in a peaceful area nearby many good restaurants. The rooms are spacious, the bed is excellent and in the bathroom you can enjoy a warm bath or swim in the hotel's swimming pool. I would recommend Kubu Tani as accommodation for a short or longer visit to Sidemen, if you are looking for accommodation with a great view and a good location and being close to nature is not a problem for you.",The room so big but its need misquito or something cover at ventilation to avoid insects and strong wind.

I came here for lunch and a much-needed break after being busy all morning. The atmosphere, service, and food were excellent. Food takes a bit of time to come out, but that‚Äôs how you know they‚Äôre making it fresh. The coffee variety here is probably the most diverse you can get in Sideman, so I highly recommend it!

Amazing view on second floor with light breeze, friendly and helpful staffs. Price wise, drinks are cheap, but food are a bit more on the high side.

Service is seriously the most terrible homestay we have stayed. We have work in Bali and currently staying for 6 months in Bali. We chose Sidemen to stay for a month and this is our worst experience.

1) their food is holy expensive although the restaurant has no view. If you walk to tourist town where lots of restaurants with rice terrace view, the food ranging from 30-60k per item as well.

2) the owner who is the female chef favor white more than Asian. She offered white cheaper price and when we asked, she suggested us to move . Although we have stayed there and extended nights.

3) she has been very rude to guests. We never seen her smiling. But her daughter and her son are nice but they just cannot make decision.

4) location: far from everywhere. Like very far to any restaurants Omg . For that price ? I can find tons of homestay in town with the rice terrace view.","If I could give more than 5 stars for the room, I would.

Read some reviews on unfriendly owner or staff, I experienced none of that. I was greeted warmly with handshakes by the staff when we first arrived.

After homestay/guesthouse hopping for the entire month, being a toilet OCD, I more or less know the standard of cleanliness in Bali. And, I also tried not to trust images or some reviews posted on Agoda and even Google 100%. Everyone's standard of cleanliness varies, so I always keep an open mind.

I was really taken by surprise for a cheap homestay like Jana, the room's toilet was, so far the cleanest I had ever seen among the few homestay/hotel/guesthouse I stayed in Kuta, Canggu, Amed and Candidasa.

What I like:

Jana's room
1. It has kettle and cups, previous hotel doesn't have any. It was a HOTEL.
2. Two litter boxes.
3. King size mattress is not lumpy, solid but not hard. Very comfortable.
4. Has a mosquitoes netting.
5. Aircon is super powerful.
6. Very clean.

Jana's toilet (my favorite)
1. Clean basin, toilet bowl (I almost cried seeing clear of stain).
2. Shower, water pressure is powerful.
3. The tiles dried up easily after shower and coarse so it is not slippery. I had bad experience in previous few hotels/guesthouse with glossy tiles.üò≠
4. Shower water takes less than 2 min to heat up. (Blessing).
5. Everything in here look well-maintained after covid, a lot of hotels in Bali, weren't.
6. Smell good, no funky smell.

Will be staying here for 3 nights, hopefully it is quiet at night, (I have a feeling it will be based on the surrounding).

Location is not near the main busy area, but still walkable distance. So far no complain.","While all other homestay or hotels offer free water and breakfast with either Indo style or American style.

Jana homestay offer only American style with option of toast and eggs. No fruits unless you order. And you have to choose either tea or juice. Not both juice and tea like other places.

Service is definitely bad. I didnt feel welcoming from the MOM who is owner"

View: We had a nice verandah with 2 chairs and a table with a view of the pool and the garden. The stay has a well maintained garden with plants and flowers making it look lovely. You get a nice view of Mt. Agung from their restaurant.
Suggestions: The open bath feels bit uncomfortable, as I saw someone using a drone outside. The placement of soaps and shampoo in the shower is bit awkward.","We truly liked everything! The location is perfect, with an amazing view on mount Agung by clear sky. The room and bathroom are super clean, with all the facilities (kettle, fan, soap, shampoo, 2 sets of towels per person, etc). The bed is also super comfortable. The breakfast included is very good and the restaurant also serves delicious dishes for the rest of the day. But the best thing at Giri Carik was definitely the staff. Very welcoming, always there to help with a big smile. We had a great stay!","The staff was great, the rooms are in good condition even after the long corona period. The view from the restaurant ( first floor)  is so spectacular that it's hard to leave for a dip in the pool, set up in a beautiful garden. Breakfast was great, they have good coffees and yummy food. The staff speaks great English and are very sincere! Can't wait to go back!","Nice affordable place to stay near Sidemen.
Good area for walks along the ricefields.
Food is good and reasonably priced.
Could maybe more spicy but forgot to ask.
Good beds.
We had no mosquitos so did not need net.
Fine small clean swimming pool.
Very friendly people!
Quiet area!"

I also rented a scooter from them to go around the area.
They have laundry service and a restaurant.

They are simply amazing people and I'm so happy to be back again!","Yudi and his family are the perfect place to stay couple of days in Sidemen!
The breakfast is healthy and tasty (big up to the banana pancakes ü•û)
They also offer plenty of activities!
We did the rice terraces trekking, rafting, cooking class and massage; all of them was well organised and wonderful ‚ò∫Ô∏è
If we come back in this area in Bali for sure, we'll stay there!","I loved staying here. Yudi and his family are so nice and welcoming. They really take good care of you. For example, Yudi and his wife took me and and my stuff on their scooters to my next homestay (no rooms available at Milla for me to extend). That‚Äôs going above and beyond! Yudi also gave me great tips about things to check out in and around Sidemen.","I had the best time at Milla homestay. The whole family is amazing, they are so caring and smiley and loving.

Nevertheless, no windows in the bathroom and the fan didn‚Äôt work so it doesn‚Äôt smell good and was always wet.
Some construction work just in front of the lobby, so breakfasts were noisy. Probably an extension of the hotel..
Shadow was missing around the swimming pool to enjoy it during the day.
Breakfast was light (you need to choose between fresh juice and fruits plate and if you take the plate, you gonna have few slices of fruits almost sweet). You also have to decide the day before your breakfast time. The last day we were in time but our dishes was cold.
Finally, guesthouse suggests to drive us to amed and it was 500k rupees, a bit expensive (vs 350k rupees for another pick up with egal duration / distance by a classic taksy companies).","My girlfriend and I came up to Sidemen for the weekend to get away from Canggu. It‚Äôs a lovely mountain town with rice terraces, palm jungles and surrounded by mountains. We stayed at Astana Sawah in the honeymoon suite, which was clean, comfortable, affordable, and has beautiful views. The staff is super friendly and helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. We would gladly stay here again.","What a delightful place! Ayu and Gusti went out of their way to be helpful. The views are stunning and it's so quiet and peaceful. I swam every day in the pool. I also went on a trek led by Ayu to an ancient temple in the 'jungle'. It was a really special experience. I was booked for 2 days but stayed an extra 2. I loved my upstairs room and ensuite. It's important to take cash when you stay in Sideman as there isn't an ATM that accepts Visa.
I also had a fabulous in-house massage at a very reasonable price. Putu was very professional and a lovely girl.
Thanks for a memorable stay. üôè","Pros
- intimate peaceful location( nestled in the jungle
- large room, with high ceiling and great decorations
- lovely owner and staff

Cons
- the hotel has seen better days and needs some maintenance work, including the bathroom, and the pool area. Part of the hotel is currently under construction.
- paid 1.3m IDR per night which is overpriced, compared to nicer places in the area","Absolutely wonderful place, my friend stayed here and I stayed in the owners other property close by but they were incredibly welcoming tentative staff even though I was just visiting. The food was good quality and very reasonable prices. The pool overlooked the nature mountain views. Everything was clean and well maintained. Had the pleasure of meeting the owner who was an absolute gem! He came to check on me as I was staying alone to make sure I didn't feel scared. Taught us so much about the Balinese culture. Made us laugh so much. Honestly couldn't ask for a better experience. My friend who slept there also absolutely loved it, not a bad word to say at all! Highly recommend!"

We rented a motorbike as well and worked perfectly.
Thanks so much!","My partner and I stayed here for three nights at the beginning of our two week trip in Bali. The view from the balcony is gorgeous, the daily breakfast was delicious, and the hosts were the absolute best!!! The guesthouse is walkable to the nicer and more touristy dining/lodging, but also close to the more local and authentic warungs.
The owner of the guesthouse also offers tours/taxi services. Our second day in Sidemen, he drove us to Besakih temple and a gorgeous waterfall afterwards where we had the most delicious lunch with the most incredible view! The host was very knowledgeable of the area and offered advice when visiting the temple. Our last day staying with them, he drove us to our next destination and also arranged an early breakfast for our day of travel.
Very highly recommend the Mantra Guesthouse!!!","This is a lovely guesthouse to stay. The room is big, same as the bathroom.
The view is amazing on the mountains and ricefields
The breakfast was generous! Many options
They helped us with taxi, scooter rent and recommendations
The only thing is, there is no air con, so it can get a little bit hot, even with the fan

Great wifi connection. Excellent location with great views of Mt. Agung. Very peaceful place to relax. It was so comfortable we preferred to lounge on our private patio than head into town. Our booking included breakfast which was great. Really enjoyed the coffee, fresh fruit, and banana pancakes. We also appreciated the complimentary tea/coffee they provided upon arrival. The family is very friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend!","Our stay here was lovely, the owner and his family were really friendly and accommodating. Their food is really great in comparison to the other warungs here, be it their traditional fare or Western cuisine.

The bed comes with a nice mosquito net and it is really cooling in the night and morning. Towels and body soap are provided but all else do remember to bring your own :) We had most of our meals in the dining area except tea time once at our patio.","If you want to balance your mind, body and soul - visit Ari & family in sidemen!

There was no aircon and the electric fan provided had a short lead so you couldn‚Äôt place it in a appropriate area to keep two guests cool. There was a strong smell coming from the bathroom which was due to the drains.

I really wanted to visit the place - can‚Äôt explain why  - just a feelingI had from London that I had to do a stop‚Ä¶ and we are so glad we did. We spent 8 lovely hours at the property having a wonderful meal at the Bagus restaurant and participating in some wonderful treatments and activities; massage, water purification ceremony, and sound bath.

Ayu‚Äôs daughter was so kind and took us guided us through the whole process - one we will never forget. And the massages and sound bath were also wonderful! Ayu, Bagus and family have a wonderful energy and heart that is so genuine - hence all the positive reviews.

Thank you Ayu and family for a wonderful day at your property - treating us like guests and one of your own. Truly a genuine and memorable place!

Bagus is a great cook and we enjoyed several delicious meals at his restaurant.

Overall a wonderful experience!","This is a magical place where we found a magical family! We already stayed 2 times and are looking forward to come back in October.
Starting with the rooms, which are very comfortable, daily cleaned and with a view directly to the jungle vegetation, to Bagus restaurant where everything is cooked with fresh ingredients and tastes delicious, to Laksmi yoga center where the classes are a pleasure mixed with hard work. I‚Äôve specially left at the end the best part; there are plenty of activities you can do here in the true traditional Balinese way, that will represent food for your soul: morning prayer, astrology charts, sound healing ceremony (definitely recommend it), water & fire ceremonies, reflexology, massages, singing bowls and many more.
We did almost all of them and it was amazing how it felt! Ayu is a true healer.","We didn't stay here we came here for the morning yoga class at 8am, because on Google it was showing as the location of Sidemen Yoga Studio, but it must have closed down during the pandemic, now there is a lovely family run wellness centre and guesthouse were you can get a massage, have a yoga class or cooking class. I recommend you to visit one day before if you want to do a yoga class to confirm, but regardless the lovely teacher says she does yoga in the Shala by herself if there are no guests, she is a very good teacher, recommend. Prices are reasonable. We also got given a papaya juice before our class which was made with papayas from the trees in their garden, and a Balinese coffee afterwards. Honestly I recommend you visit this place, even if just for a massage. The whole family is lovely and it is really an amazing experience. It costs 150k per person for the 8am yoga class."

Her English is quite good and she is just as happy to say something friendly as sharing insight about everyday life on the Island if the Gods. A highlight of my two day stay has been a ""class"" on the daily ceremonial routine which involves creating the offerings and then offering them in the family temple and on the compound (remember: the scooters get the flower basket and the holy water but no incense stick). You sepend most of your time chatting, asking he questions and answering hers, time flies and at the end you may just have gathered a more substantial insight into Balinese mentality than having taken your fiftieth insta-worthy photo or third hike to ""a beautiful waterfall"".
