ChIJD05DIGCH0S0RWHpxe_1xtRA,Bali De Pardis Cottages,-8.2704649,115.0163711,"Munduk, Jl. Desa Bengkel, Banyuatis, Kec. Busung Biu, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81154, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=1203993808903174744,OPERATIONAL,+62 877-7781-7774,,lodging,4.8,85,,We truly recommend this place for nature lovers. Located on rice terraces with fantastic view. The owner Mr Komang is really helpfull. He and his Staff made our stay unforgettable. They helped us with private transport and rented for us a motorbike. Breakfasts and diners were delicious. This place is worth to comeback.,"firstly we are very mature aged travellers, so what bothers us may not bother younger people.
the 2 houses, one is being renovated, are within a few meters from each other. we could hear everything from the neighbours.
poorly built houses with gaps and not good closing doors. bathroom barn type sliding door makes a lot of noise at night.
mosquito netting damaged and poor quality.
bed comfy.
dinner was served on our tiny outside table.
attention the pool is about 1.50 deep and has no steps to get out. i had a problem pulling myself up on the side. i hope they will put a ladder in, even a humble bamboo thing would be a great help.
the view is stunning.
If we come back to this area we will hire a scooter to explore the beautiful environment.","Best customer service in Bali. We were unable to make our planned trip to Munduk due to my partner being unwell.
The team at Bali De Pardis were extremely caring and considerate, providing flexibility and support in adjusting our plans. Based on this incredible experience alone, I have no doubt their management and cottages are 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è","If you are looking for a place to stay in Munduk, I highly recommend Bali De Pardis Cottages. It is located in the middle of nature, surrounded by palm trees and rice fields and the view from the rooms is just amazing! The staff is extremely helpful and kind and they make sure that you have everything you need at all times. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and have a beautiful veranda facing the perfect rice-field-view. They even offer the option to have dinner in the middle of the rice fields in a small pavilion all alone. I enjoyed my stay a lot and will definitely come back when I am in the area again.","Beautiful place üíó and I realy mean it. There are three separate cottages, each is one room. So just three rooms in the whole hotel. Very private feeling. It is placed just above the rice paddies, view down the hill is just wonderful. Komang it the sweetest host and all the staff is very nice and helpful. They also cook very well. Happy to found this place. Highly recommend!"
