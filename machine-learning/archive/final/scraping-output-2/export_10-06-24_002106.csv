There are several small warungs selling kopi, tea and light meals.
There are toilets available. (Rather dirty though)
There is seating with tables to enjoy the view, and eat your food","Nice little rest stop, with clean local toilets for 2000 rupiah. Also local warungs available","Really nice¬†rest area, a few parks and small shops selling snacks, drinks coffee. Good¬†beach¬†area to wander around and explore the rock pools.The visitors who come to Yeh Leh Beach will get two beauty at once. On the north side there is a river flow, while on the south side presents a beautiful view of the sand beach. Therefore unfortunately if to miss the exoticism of the existing beaches in Pengeragoan Village, District Pekutatan this. It is about 53 kilometers from Denpasar, but it will not be hard to find because the Yeh Leh Beach is right on the edge of the highway that connects Denpasar and Jembrana. One of the unique things of Yeh Leh Beach is the buffalo statue. There are three statues of a buffalo being driven, symbolizing Makepung tradition in Jembrana. Makepung itself is a buffalo racing competition held between July and October to commemorate the harvest","Yeh Leh beach is located in between Jembrana and Tabanan. It‚Äôs not exactly a destination but rather like a rest spot or toilet stop on the way to Denpasar.

However, on some months when the rocks are fully covered with long flowing beach moss, this place becomes a hot spot for landscape photographers. Be there at sunrise or sunset, with a tripod and variations of ND filters big stopper and whatnot, you can capture some stunning long exposures shots. Those giant rocks can look so out of this world with the right framing and lighting.

Rumours said that those pillar-shape rocks are rubbles of ancient buildings","Nice place where to stop in the area, you can seat under the shadow, have some drinks or local food from the vendor and restart your trip refreshed!  There is a toilet, but is not very clean!"
