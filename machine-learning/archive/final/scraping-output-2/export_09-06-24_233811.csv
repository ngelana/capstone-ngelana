The staff was very friendly and told/showed us a lot about the area and how they processed rice from the plantations. Afterwards we had a flat tire on the scooter, the staff was very helpful and proposed to take the motorbike to the mechanic and get it fixed. We didn't even need to pay for it which was so kind.
After all a very positive experience!","The food was ok, the rice was good but the egg too oily. Great view and the owner was very friendly. He gave us free passion fruit from his trees, very good.","Beautiful view, delicious food. Owner is a local organic rice farmer who is full of information and knowledge and smiles.  Well worth the stop."
