Beautiful decor, very romantic with candles live piano and jazz music on select nights.

Friendly staff and delicious food. Vegetarian options.  Best restaurant in the area.

One advice for the restaurant owners is to supply cold towels for washing hands after a hot day.

Thanks Sparks","Booked in for a romantic dinner and to enjoy the live music.
The food was amazing! Fantastic vegetarian options. Speedy service. Wait staff were very attentive. Music was also great. Very talented musicians.
We were seated at the very front of the restaurant, nearest to the road, lots of road noise and it was hot. Put a bit of a downer on our experience. My tip would be to specify that you want a table inside, in the back away from the road when you book.","There are no bad places on this strip but if you want the best then come here. Great food, great drinks, great vibe and great jazz night. Not your cheapest night out in Bali but you honestly won’t regret coming here. Special 🫶",The place is really nice and the menu offers unusual dishes. The food was okay. We liked the tempe ratatouille that was a fun way to fuse tempe and parmigiana di melanzane. The coconut dessert was also good.,"The place is very classy, nice atmosphere due to the jazz music, one of a kind in Candi dasa, although you can hear traffic noise from the busy road. We had vegan dishes there which were good and we also tried their desserts that are just mind-blowing! It's worth it to go there just for the desserts alone."

I was lucky enough to have a villa with a beach front view which was stunning. The F&B staff were polite and knowledgeable about their products, and the Chef definitely deserves praise for the delicious food. The housekeeping team did an amazing job, with artfully placed towels on the bed upon arrival. The room was spotless, despite the challenging humid climate near the sea.

Beautiful view of the ocean too! Loved the outdoor bathroom. Every single staff member was very happy and kind. Perfect location, beautiful staff and would definitely recommend to anyone heading to Candi Dasa.","Puri Bagus is paradise, we have stayed here many times as it is our favourite place in Bali.  There is a huge and deep pool, as well as a children's pool.  The hotel is along a charming little road, so there is no traffic noises.  It's right on the ocean, with a beautiful view across to the Islands.  They have wonderful little hut's on the beach with a huge bed and pillows for relaxing.  The breakfast buffet is fabulous.  The rooms are spacious, light and very clean and comfortable.  The Manager Krisna and the staff make you feel welcome and are super helpful, and the grounds are lush and pretty.  The restaurant is also excellent.  Thank you Puri Bagus, we will be back.","I highly recommend this place to everyone. This resort has special charm. You will feel relaxed from the first step that you enter. All the staff here are very welcoming, attentive and helpful - something from their hearts that you could feel.

The location is right in front of the beach. You can rent a scooter to get around. Many restaurants and bars offer free pick-up and drop-off service.

Our first time at this gem but definitely not our last. Our room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was excellent too! Candidasa is super chill and relax. Puri Bagus Candidasa Hotel is the best choice to stay.","If you're looking for somewhere quiet, this hotel is the right choice. The staff is always friendly and excellent.

We ate breakfast lunch and dinner there practically everyday and never had a bad meal. We cannot recommend Ganesh Lodge enough. Thank you so much.","Stayed here 3 nights, amazing place with a pool. Stuff are amazing and always caring and helping. When we came first thing they send us to the room, without registration, and after that came to the room with a paper, which was very kind, because it was hot outside at noon time, and we just filled up the papers at room under AC - very thoughtful of the stuff. And there was a cold welcome drink! Food is amazing. Try fish of the day with tarragon and steak with Roquefort. Amazing! It’s a like little heaven. Perfect for someone who is into quite really enjoyable holidays
Btw, you can get a relaxing massage here for very attractive price","Great place to stay! We planned only 2 days, for jet lag chillout, but we decided to extend it to 4 days. The staff, the place, the food is exceptional and extremely helpful. This place is also convenient to see Lempuyang temple, water temple, water palace and virgin beach.

Pool area and lawn great. Very serene place, we stayed a week. We chose to enjoy all our meals in the restaurant on premise. Food was very good, Indonesian and western, very fresh and prepared well. Lovely staff; attentive and warm; very clean and well kept. Our room on the floor had a fantastic, wide ocean view!  We loved our stay!","This place wasn’t for me. It was just not a 3 star and I had a shocking experience checking in. Nothing to do with money. I cycled on my bike for over 3 hours, was sweaty and just wanted to have a drink and shower. It took them SIX MINUTES to tell me I still had to pay beforehand. Money wasn’t the issue and I paid. I just wanted a shower! Now I could’ve taken that shower within SIX MINUTES. So I ask management to show some discretion. No, it was all about taking your money and running. Sure, gardens are lovely and you’re right on the beach. But the rooms need some repair. I think the whole outdoors feel makes people forget the tired rooms (see pictures). Plenty of better places to go. And for less money! And one right next door!! I didn’t eat the restaurant but you’ll find prices half the price on the Main Street. And you have to wait a minute for the water to get hot?? Are we living in the dark ages?? I notice management commented on what they want to comment on. Everything I have said is true and the pictures show the true extent of the place. That shower door should’ve been fixed before I arrived. And I bet it still hasn’t been fixed now. I’m still in town. Maybe I should check in to room 5 again to see if it’s been fixed…","I am amazed by this hidden gem!

It’s truly beautiful here! The price value is on point! The view is gorgeous, it’s clean, the staff is super friendly, the food at the restaurant is really good and it is quite here. You will not find many places in Bali, at the beach, super green and still so quiet.

I loved my stay and will come again! Thank you for the great time!","I recently had the pleasure of staying at a remarkable beachfront hotel, and I stayed in the beach front room. Let me start by saying that the views from my room were absolutely breathtaking. Waking up to the sight of the sparkling ocean was a dream come true.

The staff at this hotel were incredibly friendly and made me feel right at home. Their warm and welcoming attitude truly enhanced my stay. The restaurant, with its fantastic views, served delicious meals that satisfied both my taste buds and my desire for a stunning beachside backdrop.

I was also impressed by the impeccable maintenance of the hotel's gardens. The lush greenery added a touch of tranquility to the already serene surroundings. It was a pleasure to stroll through the well-kept paths and take in the natural beauty.

One of the highlights of my stay was the opportunity to snorkel right off the beach. Being able to explore the underwater world just steps away from my room was an incredible experience. Additionally, I took advantage of the option to hire a boat from the beach and embarked on an unforgettable snorkeling adventure to the nearby islands and blue lagoon. It was truly a magical excursion.

While my stay was undeniably wonderful, I believe there are a few improvements that could take this hotel to the next level and make it an even more luxurious destination. Firstly, I noticed that the hotel sign on the road seemed quite small and outdated. Upgrading this signage would better reflect the elegance of the hotel.

In addition, the bath towels in my room appeared a bit worn and frayed. Replacing them with fresh, high-quality towels would add a touch of luxury to the overall experience, ensuring that every aspect of the stay feels top-notch.

Lastly, the long and dusty driveway could benefit from some enhancements. Adding some landscaping would create a more polished and upscale arrival experience.

These suggestions are simply meant to enhance an already exceptional hotel. Overall, I had a truly wonderful stay and I hope that the management will consider these ideas to further elevate the hotel's status and provide an even more luxurious experience for future guests.

I highly recommend stay at this hotel 🏨","Colleen H

We experienced Bali hospitality from their front desk staff who even took initiative to notice my husband's birthday and got him a surprise cake to celebrate for him. We were delighted and touched by their thoughtfulness :)","A tranquil place to chill and relax. Staff are super friendly, personal and helpful.

Although the room is smaller than expected, it is clean and comfortable. Room furnishing is simple but gives a good Balinese feel. Room fully air-conditioned, with an operational overhead fan.

There is a small beach in front of the beach club during low tide. Clean sandy beach, with no rubbish seen during my trip there.The water is  clean and clear.

What an amazing little hotel/bungalows on the beach front. I was so surprised with the menu that caters for everyone and bloody good food.
The bungalows were clean and super comfortable with great air con.
The swimming beach out front was crystal clear and full of see life. We must have seen 10 turtles. So much to do and see close by.
We really got the authentic Bali feels at this place. Cannot recommend it highly enough.
Bloody Gem 💎","Loving it here. A 10 minute walk to the main street, but for the peace and quiet, and ocean view, it is well worth it.
I had a sore eye today, and management kindly ran me down to the pharmacy. Very kind.
Restaurant staff are lovely. I love that I get to eat so much fruit at breakfast. And the juices are divine.","When I came to the facility, at first everything seemed perfect. Entering the sea just a few meters from the room, breathtaking view. Ladies from restaurant were adorable. But unfortunately that was the only good thing. Since you sleep with other people room to room, you can hear absolutely everything that happens around hotel. People sit outside at 6 in the morning and play with children, while you sleep, and the hotel staff obviously did not think to ask the guests to be quiet, considering that they are not the only ones in the hotel. The food in is 5/10, edible, but that's the least of the problems. I got food poisoning here, and it must have been their food because I only ate at the hotel. I wash my teeth with bottled water so that was not an issue as well. Two days of stomach cramps and painful trips to the toilet, which really ruins the vacation and turns it into hell. After I informed the staff about the food poisoning, they looked at me strangely and assured me that this had never happened to them, even though I read later on the reviews that it had. They looked at me as if I was lying about being poisoned. They made me pay everything I ate, and blamed me that I’ve touched something outside of hotel and that because of it I got sick. Really unprofessional, specially because we are talking about 23€ bill.","Relaxing bungalow with all necessary, nice design outside shower as an addition to the regular one. Beautiful garden around and pool, and location right on the seafront. Staff in restaurant very attentive, we felt like at home.","Puri Oka is a slice of Heavan in Paradise its relaxing atmosphere and beautiful staff and surroundings made for a beautifully relaxing break from the hustle and bustle of life.. A dreamy spot situated on the water in Candidassa with views of the ocean, private beach with very authentic beautifully appointed Balinese style decor and a relaxing feeling of home away from home.. I cannot recommend Puri Oka highly enough.. the staff were so welcoming and wonderful I am feeling very relaxed, some highlights include,  swimming with turtles just off the back wall, eating the delicious food prepared by the team and experiencing the real beauty of Bali! Close to live music venues and a leisurely walk to the shops I definitely will be back and will be bringing my family and friends! 10/10"

Dtunung is a bit further from the main road, and has the surf added as white noise. Dtunung has better access to the beach. Rama's grounds are better maintained. Rama Shinta is more compact with the rooms surrounding the pool. Dtunung is larger and the bungalows are further from the pool. Neither has very good wifi.  Room size is bigger at Dtunung and there is an outdoor bathtub. Rama Shinta is decorated, while Dtunung is bare. A painting or 2 and a couple throw pillows would definitely add to Dtunung's appeal.

There is a rocky beach so not suitable for swimming, with not much walking area near the beach that we could find. There are some cafes and convenience stores nearby on the main street but it was noisy and quite a busy road.
Our room was well decorated with a beautiful bathroom area. The room was a little small with no tv. There was a jug of water supplied which we could get refilled at the restaurant.

Fast check in and room was ready 2hours before check in time.

Staff helped me with my big bag and lead me to my bungalow

WOW WOW WOW

THE small balcony to the room was great with a nice cane sofa and seperate seat, pedestal fan, fully stocked mini bar with soft drinks, water, beer and snacks.

Then you enter the bungalow 🙏🏻
It smelt so fresh and nice.
They had the AC already on which always an amazing pre thought and really gives you a nice feeling.
The room is fantastic in everyway.

A WELCONE SIGN on the floor made with fresh flowers,
An amazing fruit basket which is complimentary

Pool towels, ear plugs in cases, even a nice straw sun hat for the ladies and a woven bag to take to the beach
These guys have thought about everything.

Mosquito spray
Toothbrush & toothpaste all supplied.

The bathroom is huge and incredibly nice with modern fitments, hot water on demand and a nice bath for a relaxing evening.

Now for the restaurant =

I ordered the following;
Caesar salad which was very simple and had only 4x prawns which were not cleaned at all.
No salt/pepper / condiments on table
Nothing special and very basic
Pasta al fungi needed salt and pepper then only then it was good.

The young girl who served me didn’t go out of her way to perform a thorough service as l had to ask for everything.

Overall the place is very nice and well priced.","What a lovely boutique resort! We had a great time there! The staff is super nice and helpful, the rooms very big and comfortable (the best bathroom you can imagine, it’s massive) a great swimming pool and the best food ever. Everything is cooked with fresh ingredients and they even make their own bread and desserts! I’m sure we will back again!","I’m giving this five stars for how thoughtful the was.  Flowers in the room, fruit basket in the room, arranged early morning snorkeling and we had three rooms reserved, but they were not next to each other due to the room types. They upgraded my sister-in-law to the owner suite and had it ready for her in less than a half hour allowing all three villas to be next to each other.
The food was outstanding, try the smoothie bowl for sure.","Super nice place to spend a holiday with family or with friends. Spacious rooms, open bathrooms, big pool.

Super friendly and attentive hosts.

Special thing of the place is definitely the restaurant with a super delicious food from the chef! yummy!!

One more special thing which made our stay perfect - the yoga shale on the territory of the hotel. Morning practice was peaceful and cozy)

The most important is the atmosphere of the place-homy, cozy, pleasant which makes you want to come again. We will definitely return here.","Nice place, especially half-open gardened bathrooms, sensitive and responsive staff, good Russian food and bread. you can book snorkelling at the hotel. During our stay food serving were 20-45 mins, which seemed too long."

I did it with my son and our instructor Cezar was amazing and very patient with us;) also room was cozy, and well cleaned. thanks again for everything 🙏","I am absolutely blown away by the experience, quality of service, every member of staff and just how amazing every single detail about our stay and scuba certification was here!
Pablo is hands down the best scuba instructor and just overall amazing human being me or my girlfriend have ever met! The course was incredible, the dive locations were amazing and after each dive, meals and drinks were phenomenal! What truly made everything so special however were the people involved. We consider Pablo and each member of the staff to be among some of the best people we have ever met on any of our trips. We will never forget this experience and are eternally happy and grateful for everyone and everything involved!","Went for my first dive with Benthos Bali and had an amazing experience. I was a bit scared at first but Pablo and his team made sure we were comfortable, it was well organized and we had a great time. I would highly recommend this place if you ever consider diving in Bali with friendly but professional people ! My boyfriend even went for two more dives the next day
Thank you Pablo !","Absolutely stunning service provided by these guys! Do not miss diving and horse riding with them. They will always go an extra mile to make sure you feel like home and have the best experience. Huge thanks to Sri, Mariano and Pablo! All the best! 🌞💚"

Great ocean view (take a snorkeling mask with you). The spa area looks great and the prices are average for the city. Probably most of the advantages are due to the hotel manager, who was very friendly, helpful and even helped us with the delivery of special food for my baby from another city.","There is nothing not to like it was the perfect place to chill for a week, comfortable rooms, great views, the sea spa is something everyone needs to experience, amazing friendly staff and decent food.","Aquaria Resort a true paradise, a beautiful oasis from the hustle and bustle of life, we stayed for a week and then returned for our last few days in Bali, the rooms, the pool, the gardens, the food and the beautiful staff are all amazing. We are already planning a return stay some day!","My favourite place to stay in Bali! The resort is lovely and quiet, a great place to relax and listen to the ocean. The staff are friendly and attentive, the food and drinks are great, and the spa is also amazing!","A magical oasis of calm. I loved Aquaria so much I didn't leave the property... why would you...everything is right here.  Beautiful rooms lovingly cleaned and looked after.

The waitress was wondering why I hardly touched my food and the only thing they could offer was a 10% discount on my dish! The lesson learned is one is better of in a real little Indonesian Warung to eat the authentic Local food than a posh looking place where you pay for the ambiance instead of for quality food.","Good vibe! The burrito was dryish, no sauce inside, the cheese is only on top (not on the picture, I asked to make mine without). They also give very little guacamole & salsa. Though I asked to bring more, and they did.

In general the restaurant looks good and the food looks decent",I took burrito chicken and pasta . Not tasty . And got sick during the night . No reply back from office when sent an update on that .expensive  with regard to the quality,Had many wonderful meals here during my 3 week stay at Puri Bagus. The Balinese cuisine is amazing as well as the many smoothies offered on their menu. Your dining experience only gets better with the gorgeous view of the ocean and the well kept grounds surrounding the pool and villas. The staff is incredibly kind and genuine!,"We had some excellent meals here during our stay but the standouts for us was the wonderful local cuisine we requested that was not mentioned on the menu. We love to try the local foods of the villages and regions we visit and when we asked them to create something for us we were blown away by the presentation, the vibrant taste of the food and the amazing low cost.

We came here for dinner and then decided to come back for breakfast. We had Fried rice with Chicken and Cha Kangkung for dinner and banana Pancakes and fruit salad with Bali coffee for breakfast. Nice and chilled atmosphere.
Thank you! 🙏","Went there on Sunday evening so we are the only customers. Only the owner is around when we were there so do expect to wait awhile. Price of food is very reasonable, possibly the cheapest in Candidasa. Food gives a homecook flavor, and uses coconut oil for the dishes.","Perfect place to have typical Balinese food and balinese prices (without tax and service charges). Their soto ayam with curry is simply delicious, as well as the balinese pancake! Highly recommended if you are around the area. We stayed 2 nights and we went for dinner both of them! 😃

The family who runs this warung is super nice and welcoming! The warung might be a bit hidden, so I have included a photo in the night of their entrance 🙂","Tried the spring rolls, the grilled chicken and the spaghetti bolognese and everything was delicious, honestly is an amazing alternative to the expensive touristic restaurants in the zone.

Also if you come try the Arak, is a traditional drink."

Portions are not very big, but the food is very flavourful, and is ready pretty fast.","The spot is really beautiful with a great view on the sea and the sunset. Concerning the food we were disappointed by the quality and quantity (see picture). We were told that it is a normal portion. Also it’s very pricy for Bali, the Burger are now all at 105k IRP compared to the 85k and 65k on the menu from 3 months ago.","Amazing! We had a delicious and healthy dinner for a reasonable price. Literally one of the best restaurants we’ve ever been to. The food was adapted to Western food standards, not spicy at all. Yet with fresh and whole ingredients. They had the “caught of the day” fish dish which we took and was very tasty and super fresh. And the Fish Sate was very yummy with a tasty peanut sauce. They also have many vegetarian and vegan options, like tempeh curry and bean burger. And as an addition, the view to the ocean is simply breathtaking!

Upon arrival, the sight of a cockroach in the door of the bathroom startled me, which surprised me because I'd never seen one in a hotel before. But the staff quickly got rid of it.

The hotel is old, with many leaks in the central area.Unfortunately, my room also had mold and cracks on the walls. Despite these issues, the rooms were clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful.Without them, I wouldn't have enjoyed my stay as much.

Moreover, the pool water made our eyes sting when we swam, which was uncomfortable. Without a friendly and helpful staff, I would have rated it one star, especially because the pool water stings your eyes.

On the bright side, the hotel is right by the beach, so we had a beautiful view and could easily go to the beach whenever we wanted. Overall, while the staff and location were good, the hotel needs improvements, especially regarding maintenance. The building is really sad to see!","Have been a week here with our geologi team.

We have free simple breakfast which you can choose between sandwich, fried rice or fried noodle and free tea and coffee too on breakfast time.

Room are clean also toilet. Shower are equip with bathtub with hot and cold water.
