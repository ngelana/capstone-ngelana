However, the owner was very rude and careless. We tried to contact him with questions or complaints but received only hostile responses. Many issues had to be solved on their own.

The house was dirty, with stained linen. There is an additional fee for laundry. In addition, the presence of insects and the unpleasant smell of mold significantly worsened the stay experience. We are disappointed that our expectations for a pleasant stay were not met due to these negative issues","In a less touristy part of Bali, security staff we're lovely.
We had mie goreng which was so delicious!
Bar staff also lovely!","Hideaway Residence Bali offers comfortable rooms and commendable services. However, the location lacks convenience, requiring some travel to major attractions. We booked a 2 nights stay for 2 rooms villa with pool, been upgraded to 3 rooms. The upgraded room at ground floor smell like newly paint odor from the bathroom. Other than that, the building and environment here are good. Grab food & Grab service are accessible to this area. Overall, it provides a pleasant retreat for those seeking a relaxing stay, but proximity to popular destinations may pose a slight inconvenience.  Anyhow, credit is due to the amazing host, Surya, who displayed exceptional hospitality amidst some of the property's shortcomings.","Amazing! We stayed there for 17 days and had the best time. The place is new and clean. The breakfast was simply amazing and so worthy - with the best pancakes I‚Äôve ever had. Surya from the reception was extremely nice and polite - and took good care of us every day.
Would definitely come back!","Great location in the heart of Bukit Uluwatu/Ungasan.
Close to GWK and Uluwatu Temple. Many cafe and restaurants can be found around this area. The place is also perfect for family or couple, long term or short term."

If you look for a great get away, within nature and with luxury feeling. This is highly recommended!

It was so nice we rebooked for
More nights. Thanks team Roots for the great experience","I booked this place for a 2 night stay. It was one of the most pleasant and quiet places I‚Äôve stayed during my time in Bali. The treehouses are lovely, you will enjoy the lovely breeze in the evening/night. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a lovely rest and relaxation. Also, there‚Äôs loads of places to visit. I would advise renting a scooter or using Grab.","Our first stop in Bali and unfortunately we left it too soon!!
Right from check-in we were made to feel right at home. Our flight was delayed twice, and eventually we got in at 2am and were  greeted with a warm smile and help with our bags and a tour of the treehouse.
We showered under the moonlight with the open air bathroom, and woke up to watching the Squirrels and birdsong. We can't believe that there were no bugs or mosquitos to worry about, and the fresh cool breeze was lovely.
This place is truly special, no matter which cabin you book. I can't believe we hesitated, it was one of our best ever stays. Thank you Roots team!","We visited here for acupuncture treatments with Tao acupuncture healing.  Diah was lovely, caring, knowledgeable and had a very healing experience. We met the owner Anna who was kind and generous. Looking forward to staying in the tree houses, looked beautiful. Very peaceful."

We rented two rooms online, as we got there the lady told us there was no rooms left. The same thing happened to two other people as we were waiting to find a solution.

We‚Äôve already booked the room in July, but when we arrived they said there was no room left and did not have our name in the system. And guess the solution? They said that we had to book another hotel and that was it.

We had to pay for the taxi from Kuta to here and then we had to book the taxi to the new hotel and their compensation was just one-third of the taxi fee?????? Not to mention the new hotel was much higher cause we booked at the last minute and we also need the difference in prices for that but nothing was shown from them. Such a bad place to live.
