You could enjoy your food while enjoying the sea view. The food is decent and the host is very friendly. The washroom is clean as well. The only downside is there are many flies there so request for a few candles. They also provide a few accommodations.,"Good food, friendly staff, an eating refuge for Angels billabong n broken beach visitors","The food is good, and beautifull view","Such a beautiful place to eat and stay. The staff are incredible friendly and helpful. They go above and beyond to do and make anything possible during your time in Nusa Penida. So thankful we found this place. Amazing sunrise and sunset, plus it was comfortable and clean inside the bungalows. So lovely and quite as well. Thanks again ðŸ–¤","The food is okay, nothing special. The view is great though and worth a stop when coming from Angel's Billabong."
