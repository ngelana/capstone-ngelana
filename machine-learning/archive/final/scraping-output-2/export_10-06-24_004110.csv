Even though the place looks so beautiful but the food is still a very good price, and still good quality.
The pizza tasted really authentic, nice thin crust.
The mojito drink was delicious.
My son loved to use the pool which was free.
We will definitely be coming there again soon.

My only very small criticism was that the food was brought to the table randomly, should be snack food first then main meals, but this isn't a big issue.

Fantastic place and definitely give it a try.","Family child friendly. Swimming, playground or just hangout, eat, day dreaming. Great view, good food with affordable price, complete facilities (wide parking lot, 2 floor restaurant, toilets, garden with wide grass area for like birthday activity). Pay 15k/person for swimming. The service is nice but more friendly and enthusiastic will be appreciated. Minus baby chair not yet provided and the road from the main road to the location is damaged badly.","Good food,
Excellent services
Beautiful ambience","Beautiful scenery, very large and long pool, great food and all at very affordable prices. Must go!","Nice place for family gathering, reunion, and other celebrations.
Buying food at least 50k,  free swimming"
