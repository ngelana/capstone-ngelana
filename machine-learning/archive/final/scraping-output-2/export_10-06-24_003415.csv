Nice place next to the rice fields,"Friendly place. Coffee was okayish, definitely needs some better dialling in on the grinder. Mango juice a bit too much ice, not enough mango. Little plastic stirrer in the juice was dirty and needs better cleaning. Morning Glory Vegetables was good as was the fruit platter. View is fantastic, so for a quick stop I'd highly recommend it if you keep in mind shortcomings on the coffee and so on. Place seems new so I'm sure it'll get sorted out.","I am writing this review based on my experience on March 25th, 2023, hoping that it is still relevant today.

After swimming at Tirta Arum Swimming Pool, drinking and buying tuak at Tuak Bejidong, I continued to Seoul Sangeh for a meal. I saw that the reviews were quite good, so I ordered a burger here. However, perhaps the burger is not the recommended dish here, as I found it to be quite ordinary compared to others at the same price.

What can be enjoyed at this restaurant, which I think is more like a cafe, is the beautiful view (rice fields) and the spacious area, which could be suitable for events. It also appears to have relatively good lighting at night (assuming the lights are placed there).

Overall, I will come back here to try other dishes, especially the pizza.",Found this gem on the way to Sangeh. Lovely. It's in the middle of rice paddy. Has beautiful view. I can spend hours eating and drinking coffee. Very peaceful at daytime. I can see farmers working. The price is also cheap. Great place to chat with friends or family.,"Was not too bad tho, my second time there. But compare with the 1st time when they're opening I think much more happening and more food options as I remember. Too bad, now they downgraded they're menu. Anyway still the best place for eat and chill if you passed into these area."

Very authentic fish restaurant in Sangeh area next to a huge rice field.

The fish was crispy and tasty, came with steamed veggie, rice and ice tea for 55k.

Amazing view over the rice paddies, relaxing atmosphere, unbelievable food and competitive pricing. We ordered the Chicken Sweet and Sour and Chicken w. Balinese sause. 10/10 would recommend."
