We (family 2+2) had a comfortable bungalow with two bedrooms, each with its own bathroom. It offered a lot of intimacy and privacy as it was shielded from the rest of the complex by walls and a gate. The partially covered living and dining area was located in the courtyard around the spacious pool. Everything in Balinese style, incredibly beautiful. Breakfast was served in the open restaurant area directly overlooking the sea.","I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE! Our room was just perfect! We have a little pool for ourselves in front of our room! I love the view, the public pool was nice. I enjoyed my stay here. Just a little note: you should bought food from other place and heat it in your room because they have microwave save me a lot of money üíÖüèº","Truly an amazing stay, we have stayed 2x here. Everytime we visit Candidasa, we will stay again here definitely!

It's worth for everything you pay.
Room is beautiful and large, especially the bathroom area. Bedroom ok, and with small terrace. Super comfy, feels like home.

It's also beachfront, also has pool facing to the beach. Completed with resto, not really big but pretty and accomodating - good for breakfast. In case of quality, it's really OK.

Check in lounge available, parking area is also large. It's located in the main road of Candidasa, easy to find resto or mini market.","Little gem in Candidasa, we absolutely loved the peacefulness, the service and the tropical feel. The rooms are clean and have all the comforts. The restaurant by the beach is so convenient and the food is fresh and tasty. Absolutely recommended.","Absolutely wonderful stay! The rooms were beautiful, it seems like they are renovating some of the rooms. I recommend getting the sea view rooms so you can see the water and get a renovated room. We stayed in A1 and would stay there again. Room was cleaned daily. There is a good size fridge, kettle and sink. This was the lazy part of our holiday so cannot comment on local attractions as we didn‚Äôt really leave the accomodation haha. The front desk was very helpful in organising drivers."

We love the kids area of the pool as my son was so happy to play in the pool.

Room was beautiful with kitchen, living, bathroom and bedroom.

Can only say Thank you. Suksma","Bali Palms is a timeshare ‚Äúresort‚Äù. We used an ‚ÄúInterval Getaway Certificate‚Äù to stay here in between using our timeshares in other parts of Bali. This was the worst stay in 4 months in Indonesia. We were not greeted when we arrived. We were given a room where they knew the air conditioning didn‚Äôt work properly.  When we asked about getting the AC fixed they moved us instead to another room which was larger but also where the air conditioning worked mildly better. We then went to other rooms of people we met at the pool area and realized that our rooms really were hot! We went to say something about the hot rooms and were told that they were sorry but ‚Äúthe people who own their timeshares at this resort will always get the best rooms.‚Äù  Please note this was in February, the off season,  there were plenty of rooms available!  Instead of moving rooms again, we left. The treatment from the management was not only less than respectful but almost belligerent when we mentioned the AC in the second room was not working. The management never even came to check it out.  There is a bright spot to this place, the restaurant staff were sweet and helpful. The other owners of timeshares were friendly and welcoming. On the whole, because of the way management treated us, truly disrespected us, and gave us no consideration we would recommend not staying here. It isn‚Äôt the way to spend a holiday.","This was one of the best places that we stayed at during our trip to Bali. Our room has a nice beach view and both sunset and sunrise were enjoyable (one won't see the rising sun or the setting sun due to location) . They have got a good pool next to their restaurant. Only issue is that their restaurant doesn't have a lot of options , but whatever we tried from the menu good.","This resort is a cheap option if you wish an inexpensive room in a quiet area of Bali. The restaurant has good food and drinks, coupled with amazing staff. The pool area is relaxing with a view of the ocean. Entertainment from an amazing band Tuesdays and Fridays. Rooms desperately need upgrades and amenities like soap and washcloths but bed was comfortable and rooms are air conditioned. I loved the added touch of arranged towel with flowers.","I didn‚Äôt stay here but came for drinks on a Tuesday. And they happened to have a live band. It was a great atmosphere, they have a very nice big pool. The pool area is perfect for watching the sun set."

My wife and I have been recommended from a friend to book at the Bayshore resort.

At the end of it I was sorry that I had to spend only one week there, because the place is sensational.

There are different kind of  rooms, our one had double bathroom, lounge area, big bedroom, with double aircon and private pool. Also minibar with drinks and snacks it‚Äôs available, and obviously the restaurant room service.

The place has an Infinity pool facing the ocean and the large pool with off course table and stools in the water.

Every morning there is a fresh cooked breakfast with a daily special. Drinks and food are amazing, the chefs are very talented. I suggest to try the typical Indonesian dinner (I forgot the name but it‚Äôs a taste of all the traditional dishes) with plenty of lovely food and an amazing poolside table set up. Every afternoon there is an happy hour for cocktails.

The staff is very very friendly, and they keep the place immaculate.
There is the option of driver for pick up and drop off airport, lots activities to be done around , and a massage/Spa, also an amazing and convenient laundry service.

I highly recommend the stay to Bayshore and I‚Äôll definitely go back.","We stayed here for our honeymoon - was perfect. The staff super friendly and helpful. The food at the resort was some of the best in the area - plenty of choices around Candidasa.

Activities and events were easy to organise with the staff.

The location was perfect and backing onto the beach made mornings and the view exceptional.

Would highly recommend and will be staying there again.","We absolutely loved our stay, our room was fantastic - what a view with a comfy bed. The staff were amazing and attentive. We utilised the service of Kadek who took us on tours for two days his knowledge and choice of locations were amazing. I can highly recommend snorkeling, you might be lucky like we were to see clown fish and a turtle. Bayshore is easy walking to shops and other restaurants. The on-site massage is a must do! This is a must stay location!","I had a fantastic stay at Bayshore. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the welcoming and friendly staff (thanks Brad and team). The room was clean, spacious, and beautifully decorated, making me feel right at home. The amenities provided were top-notch, and the attention to detail in every aspect of my stay was evident. The location was also perfect, with easy access to local attractions and dining options (food at the restaurant is also delicious). I can't recommend this accommodation enough; it truly exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be returning for another wonderful stay next year!","When booking online the 4brm apartments appeared to be overlooking the ocean. Some apartments were, but not ours.
Upstairs was extremely hot with both airconditiiners not working properly. We only stayed 1 night so in fairness didn't them give opportunity to rectify.
The wifi connection was non existent.
Staff were very friendly.
Not having a cool room really ruined our stay."

Well sign posted at first, after you leave the trees and see the hill to your right look for the turn off,  you pretty much go straight up the hill in a tight zig zag from here. Look for the flags that are similar to Australian lifesaving flags but they're not super obvious. Takes about 15-20 minutes from the main road to the top. Lovely 180 views of the coast and a good view back to the inland as well. Worth the hike. Be careful coming back down, very steep and slippery. Others mention an entry fee, no one taking payment the day I climbed.","Have chosen that hill to catch sunrise over the sea. Which was a very stupid idea as the other hill doesn't let you see the sun until it's up lol
Still, for the tracking route uphill, it took around 20 mins to climb up even though it was still dark (like 5 am). But I'm somewhat sportive person, so plan your time accordingly. There are sorts of steps here and there but it's still not easy especially going down is pretty much dangerous.
This hill would probably serve a better viewpoint for a sunrise but haven't checked that.",We walked to the top but be aware it's very steep and coming down is not easy in parts.  This track is through old rice paddies on a v steep hill. The scenery is great and you get fab views of Candidasa.,"If you riding a bike or motorcycle, be careful because the entrance path kind of bumpy. Well.. the tracking path also intriguing. It's not so high, but I recommend you to hike in early morning, because sunrise view is superb! You'll fall in love for sure! Ps : You can buy a hot coffee down the hill. It's just feels great! üòú"

The first thing to note is that this place is cash only, so leave your card at home.
All of the food and drinks are reasonably priced and worth every penny!!!
There is a great selection of breakfast, brunch, dinner, and drinks, from traditional western to traditional Balinese. There really is something for everyone!!!
Aside from the great main menu, there is a selection of home baked cakes and breads to choose from.
I had an apple crumble, it it was absolutely out of this world!!!
I also had eggs benedict which was made with the finest and freshest ingredients, and was so very tasty and well cooked.
I also had a strawberry milkshake which was just perfect!!!
There is indoor and outdoor seating available here, and the inside is air conditioned and very comfortable. This is also wheelchair friendly.
They also do a take out service for those who want to eat at home.
The staff here were very welcoming, warm, and friendly, and I couldn't have asked for a better service.
I will definitely be returning here!!","It‚Äôs my first time in Candidasa and I absolutely love it. Everything is unexpectedly good in the Loaf cafe. The mushroom soup was perfection. The avo toast with poached eggs was HUGE! And by saying ‚Äúhuge‚Äù I really mean the size of my palm portion.
And also good service, very nice beautiful girl at the counter.
Thank you, Loaf Cafeü©µ",You‚Äôll miss this place if you go past too fast. I had a great mocha! And a decent smoothie bowl. Easy to revisit.,"A lovely little Cafe with great food at reasonable prices on the main stretch in Candidasa. We tried the Eggs Benedict, Smashed Avo and Bircher Muesli and they were all great as were the coffees. The Mango juice was a bit bland so could have used a little flavour enhancing but overall a pretty great spot for brekky.","This little cafe is a real surprise, and I would have never expected to find such a place in Candidasa.
The menu offers an original choice (Western style) and the food, made with fresh ingredients, is excellent. I think their chicken & leek pie is the best I've ever had - sorry for my UK and Irish friends! üòâ I also liked the beans salad, avocado toast, and the cakes, especially the coconut one! Simply delicious. Thumbs up to the cook and kitchen staff. Coffees and teas are a bit expensive - Being French, I tend to use the price of espresso coffee as a reference, and I'm not sure to understand why it is more expensive here than in a lot of places in Europe. The overall prices have gone up vs the menu displayed in some pictures. I've read a lot about the friendliness of the staff in the comments, but as far as I'm concerned, I've never had a lot of smiles (except from one gentleman, who I only saw once) nor a super friendly welcome, although I think I'm always nice, polite and respectful."

The restaurant layout was clean and had stunning views.
There is the option of both indoor and outdoor seating, and regardless of your choice, you still get to take in the stunning views of the ocean and mountains.
This place takes cash or a card, and the prices are very reasonable for food and drinks.
I tried a few dishes, which were all tasty and freshly prepared!!!
They have a traditional wood fired pizza oven, and the pizza was cooked to perfection.
I also have the nasi goreng, and the mie goreng on other occasions, which were all perfect in every way!!!
There is a great choice of food and drinks to cater for all tastes and an extensive alcohol and cocktail selection to choose from.
The team here take so much pride in what they do, and we're welcoming and attentive. They went above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant experience, and I couldn't thank them enough.
I will definitely be returning here on my next holiday, and I highly recommend anybody visiting Candidasa to stop here for food!!!","I happed to stay two villas down from The Lotus Seaview Restaurant and did my TikTok live from there as well. Number one, view is amazing and number 1 that should be two but I can‚Äôt decide are the sunsets. Yes the food is also good and nearly every table has a view. The staff was very attentive and polite.
The only negative part was‚Ä¶ you need to be a muscle man to open the bottle caps on the water bottles üôÇ. Good selection of food, drinks and deserts.

It was during sunset and the view from the restaurant is beautiful and serene. We ordered the Tuna Cerviche, Tomyum Pizza & Nasi Campur.

Tuna Cerviche - love love love it ! I have always loved cerviche and this is super delicious. The sourness is not too sour it is just nice. My fav out of all the 3

Nasi Campur - delicious. Alot of dishes in one plate and all were delicious. We asked for extra Sambal Matah and they were very generous üôÇ

Tomyum Pizza - It is a seafood pizza and again, they are generous with their toopings.

1. Location: as close to the beach as possible. It's just wow minus we didn't own it üòâMesmerizing sunset & sunrise views. One can walk to the local market & various restaurants which are quite affordable.

2. Condition: amazingly built & maintained house/home.

4. Infinity pool: what to say, we loved staying in it to the ‚ôæÔ∏è

5. Kitchen: if you can cook it, kitchen has almost all the cookware, utensils & crockery to get that done.

I booked this for a member of my staff and grandchildren as the hotel I was staying at had no availability, it was recommended and booked by the hotel I was staying at so it seemed ok at first.

The day after they (my staff) checked out the receptionist at my hotel brought me a bill for 450k IDR saying that the guests had left a day late and without saying anything at 6am in the morning, they have CCTV. This was a lie.

Rather than discussing this through phone calls and messages via my reception at my hotel I decided to drive the one mile up the road to fix the situation, the member of staff was obnoxious and clearly a liar trying to scam me.

There was no CCTV because they checked out at mid day the day before, this was backed up by my daughter in law who had my grand children dropped off to her at 19:00, it would have been pointless for the staff to drive back the two and a half hours when their apartment is in Legian. Also the hire car was returned on time.

I tried to explain this to the staff who was a cleaner (I think) who got angry threatened me with police and saved photos of my passport at me in a clear attempt to scare me into paying more money.

The only excuse given was that a pair of underwear was left on the floor and they did not turn off the AC. this is not good enough reason to charge another night neither is it a reason to lie to the hotel where I was staying.

No manager or owner could be contacted which makes me think that she was only interested in keeping the money for herself.

Despite only being a small amount of money this left a bad taste in my mouth so I left cadidasa early, I won't be returning despite enjoying my stay at The Fourth Eight Resort.

Bali has changed since COVID-19 and it seems not that from the second you walk out of arrivals until the moment you leave people are trying to scam, steal and trick you.

Do not stay at this hotel.",,,,

I stayed nearby for two days and ate here lunch and dinner because of a recommendation and I was so thoroughly impressed.

I tried several dishes but my favourites were koloke with chilli piecing and the fish fillets with Balinese sambal. I will remember this place fondly üôè thank you so much.","This is such a great warung! Please don‚Äôt be put off by its appearance. It‚Äôs basic, but clean and very friendly.

Only get food to take away as eating there is a battle against an army of flies.

A real shame as the chicken is good.

Don't purchase the chicken nuggets, it is reclaimed chicken and disgusting.","The taste is fine.
One of the nicest chicken places in bali.
I believe the store is named after John Legend or some random celebrity called John."

And when I requested a vegetarian meal afterwards, it clearly tasted like they put fish oil on it.
Other than that it is probably a great restaurant :)","Had a lovely lunch here. Yummy samosas, sweet and sour chicken and banana pancake. Everything was fresh and very tasty.
