I‚Äôve had an incredible experience here and I will be back as soon as I can!
Not only was there hospitality impeccable but they truly looked after us not only while we stayed with them but onwards through our travels!
Came for one night, stayed for 2 and will be back on our way through!
Thank you kebunaya backpackers!!","We arrived at the lodging during the adjacent mosques afternoon call to prayer. It was deafening.
It continued for hours.
It recommences in the morning at 0521, I'm told.
The pool, our primary reason to choose this lodging, was empty. Closed for refurbishment.
Numerous goats surround the property - which would require us disposing of our footwear whilst in transit through Australian customs, such is the gravity of the current foot and mouth outbreak in Bali.
The room looked clean, but we declined to stay here. The owner refused to give us refund. Very disappointed!","2 stars because of nice host, but the place was a disaster, it was clearly visible that this place is not maintained often and well, there were no other guests (no wonder), room itself was not that bad, had some weird smell, you could sleep there I guess, but the bathroom area was in really bad shape, spiders, ants, overall not clean, we decided to leave the place for other hotel","Very nice owner, but awful rooms with no ceiling, no window and awful smell. We came, but couldnt stay there, so we had to find another variant. Would not recommend.",Our 1st experience was tantalizing to come to bali again ... ... ... ... ... thanks for the trip on the island of a thousand temples

Order Mie Ayam plus whatever Bakso you like. Put some sambal and ketchup. It's so good.

The price is normal.","Great delicious meat bal, and nice little roadside hut to eat in üëåthis bakso stand was extremely clean and well looked after üëçüëç the only thing It lacked was the cuka(vinegar) but I've learnt this is a desired taste and isn't in many bakso stands so I bring my own ü§™ I love the flavour it brings mixed with the sambal and ketchup manis üòã",,,
