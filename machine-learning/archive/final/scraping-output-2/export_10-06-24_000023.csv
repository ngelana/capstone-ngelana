ChIJXz2mf0Y90i0RuaYn0Rf84hs,Hanging Gardens Of Bali,-8.4127542,115.23863899999999,"Buahan, Payangan, Gianyar Regency, Bali 80571, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=2009445562984146617,OPERATIONAL,,resort_hotel,"resort_hotel, swimming_pool, spa, hotel, lodging, sports_complex, restaurant, food",4.7,1525,PRICE_LEVEL_VERY_EXPENSIVE,"The hotel is a tropical paradise located in central Bali. The villas are well planned perfectly overlooking the rain forest with temperature controlled infinity private pool to every villa. The sound of river , the cold breeze, the frequent rains and the infinite pools overlooking the forest can take your breath away.
The hotel carry handful of common amenities, such as swimming pool, spa, one restaurant and boutique shop. Food options are limited , and though the breakfast was worthy, but I was expecting a buffet in breakfast which I didn‚Äôt found.
Over all this is the better place for nature lovers and those who want to escape in tropical paradise. Be careful with kids as the property is located on contour.","Had a beautiful stay here for 3 days.
The villa‚Äôs a beautiful and it was so cool to be so close to nature & wild life.
- the gondels are very cute at the resort
-the bath tub was the best bath tub I‚Äôve ever bathed in! It‚Äôs so big and so comfortable
-the bed & room super comfortable
- views are exceptional!
-staff is also highly professional and super friendly, thank you for taking care of my man as he was sick through the whole stay.
-we ordered room services a lot as my man was sick. One night we ordered food and left the hotel room at 7pm as we had an event when we came back at 01:00 the food was still in our room with a pile of insects around it. We were very surprised by this happening in a 5 star resort. We even felt guilty to call reception in the middle of the night to take it away and found out the next morning the only put it outside next to the front door.  I believe these food leftovers outside would only attract more animals / insects.
-the price of the restaurant is really high and the food isn‚Äôt extraordinary
-the prices of the massages are also extremely high, even higher than what I pay in the Netherlands. Even though the massage therapist was really skilled but not any different than what I‚Äôm used to.
-keep in mind that its really far from the center and the taxi prices are also way more than what we thought was normal.","Best experience ever. In the middle of the nature, with so nice local employees that were aware of every single detail (our names, our schedule, everything), delicious food, rich experiences (morning walk across the rice fields and having breakfast at the guide‚Äôs house/Gusti, picnic by the river, temple ceremony and cinematic dinner), totally worth it for your honeymoon, family trip or if you simply love nature.","Me and my husband had a great experience. It is a a good spa and honeymoon hotel with great and respectful staff that aims to solve any issue regarding the stay. Just be aware that the hotel is close to the Ubud center but not the beaches, it takes around an hour to reach the closest beaches and more the most of the beaches. The hotel's setting is in the middle of the forest, so you can enjoy the great view of nature with the sounds of river. The atmosphere is very very very relaxing.","For us it is the best hotel we have ever been.
The view is amazing, the room is a paradise, the staff is adorable and attentive, and dishes a pleasure.
We highly recommend this hotel, you will keep memorable memories.
Thank you for everything, we wish you the best !
+1 for the romantic night üôèüèª"
