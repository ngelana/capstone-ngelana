Super attentive staff, caring. Looking to get to know you. Best breakfast! The black rice pudding was the best in Bali! And the coffee oooft. Besides that, room was amazing, sunrise beautiful, the view from the pool is gorgeous. Such a calming place, sound of water all the time, surrounded by rice fields and nature. Ideal location for exploring the waterfalls. Stayed here for two days and wish it was more. Thanks to all the staff, especially Pablo for the tasty cocktails :), we will be back!","We had a wonderful stay at maha hills. The pictures do not lie, it really is that beautiful. Everything was perfect, the staff, the room, the food and of course the beautiful view from the restaurant and pool. We were here for our honeymoon and stayed for 2 weeks. Every morning we had a nice and big breakfast with all kinds of food options. We did a lot of tours, also organised by the hotel, but we could also make a plan of our own, where the driver would take us anywhere we wanted in Bali. Special shout out to Ardi who has driven us safely across Bali and showed us a lot of beautiful places. We had a great time and the staff is so friendly! When me and my husband got a little sick, they took good care of us. We would definitely recommend it!","I had wonderful time in mahahill‚ù§Ô∏è
The sun rise view I can see in the balcony in the room is amazing!
Especially, the staffs are really kind and friendly. I felt comfortable in resort :)
Among them, a staff named Didit was really kind and helped us a lot.
He is such a good family in mahahill.
And he is really good at driving. I want to tell him thank for kindness!! ‚ù§Ô∏è","If you are looking for an authentic balinese experience then Maha Hills is your place to stay. The hotel is situated in the mountains, around 30 min by taxi to Lovina. When you drive up to the mountains and hotel you can see the real life of Bali and the rice fields. You can also have some nice hikes around the hotel and bump into some locals, who are very friendly. Also some waterfalls are in the surroundings.

We stayed at Maha Hills for 4 nights and enjoyed our time a lot. The hotel has small flaws, but all the positives let us forget the few flaws. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. Big thanks to Ardi, Martika, Dayu, Paris and the rest of the team, as well as to the driver, arranged by the hotel called Made.",We had a really nice stay at Maha Hills! The staff and hospitality is top notch and the jungle/rice paddy setting is beautiful and relaxing. The morning yoga as the sun rises is an incredible way to start the day!

We didn‚Äôt realize from looking on the map that both were a part of the Maha Hills Resort. It‚Äôs a really beautiful place with a lovely staff. We had drinks at the restaurant while we waited for our massage and returned for dinner after. The atmosphere is really well done, the staff is great, and the food very good. The price is fair and the menu has a pretty big selection. We stayed until after sunset and really enjoyed our time there. Consider staying at the resort if your looking for a place to stay, we certainly will next time as the whole place is a highlight of our trip so far.","I don't know how to express how great this place is.  I have never met a staff so kind and willing to do anything for you. The chef Tike and Joni makes the most amazing food. They are really good at making the food tasty and in the same time modern. Dayu makes the best drinks, It dosent matter which one you choose on the menucard she will makes it to perfection. The waiters are so kind and fun too. I loved to talk to Oke, Darma and  Erika. I stayed at Maha Hills for one week, and all the food was good and the people so nice. They arranged a floating breakfast for me,  made a dessert to me from some strawberries I had picked, and at my last day at the hotel they surprised me with dessert.

I almost forgot to mention that the pool and the views from the bar are amazing and if you are in the area you should definitely go to the bar to take a swim or just look at the amazing views from up there with all the hills and ricefields.","The best restaurant and bar I've ever visited in north Bali, this is my second time it was amazing experience with a breathtaking view, good service, and well prepared yet tasty foods and drinks. If you are in north Bali, this place is highly recommended for who like to spend the day, far from traffic noises. For me 9/10.","Dining at this restaurant is more than just a meal ‚Äì it's a sensory journey that combines exquisite flavors, stunning views, and impeccable service.

Prepare to be enchanted, delighted, and utterly captivated by the magic of this culinary haven","This place is pure magic. The architecture is so true to Bali, with such elegance. The food was impeccable, and there was so much to pick from. I had a blueberry mocktail with coconut cream, and it was the best mocktail I‚Äôve ever had. Our main server/host Darma was the sweetest man, made us laugh and kept a great vibe to the whole night.
Thank you Darma, I‚Äôll be recommending TopVibes for years to come üåª"

Its proximity to stunning waterfalls and the rich local culture enhances the stay. The hosts go above and beyond, exemplified by their effort to purchase a cable extender for a guest's work needs. The fresh laundry and delicious breakfasts add to the comfort, allowing guests to immerse themselves in the true spirit of Bali.

The retreat's breathtaking views are ever-changing, providing a mesmerizing backdrop to your stay, whether viewed from your room or the kitchen. The owner, John, stands out for his extraordinary kindness and helpfulness, always eager to share his knowledge of the area. The staff's friendliness and the presence of two charming dogs, Indie and Jackson, contribute to a homely and welcoming atmosphere.

Guests consistently feel at home, making the retreat ideal for longer stays. The anticipation of returning even before leaving is a testament to the retreat's appeal. Additionally, the location's beauty is highlighted by walking up the hill to witness sunsets over rice paddies and engaging with locals, accompanied by proud dogs. The nearby waterfall slides are a must-try. The villa's simplicity only adds to the charm, making it a memorable destination for an unforgettable stay.","This is an undiscovered gem of North Bali. Simply magical place!
The location is very close to amazing waterfalls and rich local culture. The hosts recommended us experienced local guides and offered great help. For instance, just for us, they went to local store to buy cable extender so that one of our friends could work. Laundry was fresh and clean and breakfasts tasty! You can feel the true Bali spirit here.","Wonderful!
We've been staying here for almost a month already, and we couldn't be happier!

The amazing view doesn't get old, and it's stunning and mesmerizing to observe the change in the landscape throughout the day, from the comfort of your own room or the kitchen.

The owner John, is just extraordinary. Extremely kind and helpful, always ready to land a listening year. Or to show the ropes  of the land.
And the staff is nothing short of amazing and and friendly, either.
The 2 dogs on the propriety Indie and Jackson, just make the whole experience
homier and better.

We're feeling very happy and at home here (definitely suited for longer stays)!
Honestly, we haven't even left but can't wait to come back already!

Would recommend the place to anyone looking for more authentic Bali.

If you come the village offers a few places to eat, a small market to get sweets and cold drinks. Our favourite places were Nia's in town and Monks which is up the mountain. Both of them require sweat to reach and return üòÇüòò",One of the best places I stayed on Bali! Such a beautiful house in the middle of the ricefields. Very peaceful and serene. I enjoyed every little piece of it. Host Ji is very kind and helps you with everything. He is also an excellent guide and I can really recommend his guided hike passing all the waterfalls in the area. Also the Dutch owners are very kind. Great hospitality!  I did not want to leave (actually I stayed two nights extra). I will definitely come back here!,"What a wonderful place! The pool is fabulous, the view over rice fields, the ocean on the horizon, the waterfalls, the nice people you meet walking around in the neighborhood...our boys (5 and 8) thought it to be the best place of all 6 we visited in Bali. Its calm and just beautiful. Karien and Ji with his wife were super helpful and nice. The house is really special and very stylish with its open sides. You feel like a part of the surroundings and yet cozy. Top location!","Disclaimer: We rented the inn with the 2 bedrooms. The inn has another ensuite room, and this review is for the 2 bedrooms one. The below review is a combination of facts and personal opinion of my own experience. You may have a different opinion and I respect that as well. I love Sambangan and this the review is intended for the inn's further improvement. Hope the message can be well delivered.

Location (4-5 stars): The inn is located close with a popular waterfall sites. It's amongst the rice terrace, hence, nice view from the dining and common area as well

Service (5 stars): The inn's keeper (Pak Aji & Wife) service is very good and timely. Thank you very much, Pak Aji & Wife!

Rooms (1 star):
1. Bedroom: I stayed at the upper room (because my friend needs to stay at the 1st floor room due to some circumstances). The access to the upper room is only a narrow steep steps with no handrail at all on the first half way. The bedroom is not my favourite because:
a) it's quite dangerous esp. at nights when guest need to go toilet at midnights
b) It's hard to bring the luggage upstairs given the access
c) Ok I can just bring what I need upstairs, but even without bringing stuff, it's just hard to climb and not friendly for those esp with knees issues / for the elderly
d) Many flying insects coming at night to the upper room hence I feel a bit too alarmed to sleep peacefully. there is mosquito nets surounding the bed, but after using that, it becomes stuffy. Understand that because it's located in nature, but perhaps can we have an insect trap for the room / some modification of the ventilation system?

2. Bathroom: The bathroom access is only a curtain (not a locked door), hence, feeling a bit unsafe especially for me (a female) to bathe. (again, you can have a different risk appetite but this is just what I think)

3. Main entrance (after the gate): Although there is a gate and it's a private inn, there is no front door to the inn building. (i.e. after passing the gate, we can just enter the building without any further lock needed). I just feel it's unsafe given that I need to keep my luggage at 1st floor, (because of the stair issue - See No 1 above).

Therefore, the overall rating per the above aspects are 3.3 - 3.6 stars

Note: Dear owner, apologies for the late elaboration, I was waiting to be in front of computer for easier typing. Thanks!","The beautiful place,clean,comfortable,quiet and naturally.
Beautiful ricebarn house will give you new experience when you stay there.
Highly recommended place!!!!!!!!"
