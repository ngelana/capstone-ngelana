The best time to visit is before sunrise when the landscape is stunning. The stunning views and serene atmosphere make it worth the early wake-up call. Parking facilities are available, and the entrance fee is IDR 10,000 per person, which is quite reasonable. This place is highly recommended for photography enthusiasts looking to capture breathtaking sunrise shots. It's better to check the weather forecast before visiting to ensure clear skies and the best possible experience","I visited during sunrise, and I can assure you that it was worth waking up early for. As the sun gradually emerged from behind the mountains, the entire landscape bathed in warm hues of orange and gold. The interplay of light and shadows added a touch of drama, creating a scene that seemed straight out of a painting.

Note: It's always a good idea to check the current weather conditions and visibility before planning a visit to Kintamani's mountain overlook to ensure the best experience.","Great sunset photoshot point, amazing misty view on the Songan Village, great Batur Volcano view with perfect sun rises spot. Be ready to pay the parking fee, and personal fee. 10K Rupiah/person will be charged on the spot üòÉüôèüèº","Leaving bitter after taste, when local people stop us from driving out, demanding for $$$.

Don't mind paying if stated clearly with signage. many other tourist spots are chargeable, with clear signage, and giving a chance to proceed or back out.",Amazing view!! Better be here before 5.30am
