The location is excellent, right in the heart of Bukit, making it convenient to explore the area. The cleanliness of the place was impeccable, which made us feel comfortable and at ease throughout our stay. But what truly made our experience exceptional was the amazing owner. Their hospitality and attention to detail truly exceeded our expectations. Highly recommend this homestay to anyone looking for a fantastic getaway!""","We had a fantastic stay! Such a Great area! Beautiful place with wonderful folks we got to meet and share experiences! Delicious large breakfast! Nice accommodations! Can't wait to come back and stay longer and enjoy all that is offered. The Paragliding and instructors and guidance and tandems are safe and top quality! Truly a magical place to share the friendly skies! Don't be afraid! Live, love, be free and have adventures! Much gratitude and blessings to Ketut and family!","The Perfect  accommodation on the Bukit! Best price\value ratio! Clean comfortable rooms with smart TV, fridge, electric kettle for coffee and tea. Huge beautiful common room, nice pool and even a kitchen for the guests.
5 minutes from the beach, quiet location (now Bali is very busy with huge traffic and here its still quiet)
Very close to Timbis Paragliding site (which is a must to try here, with stunning view from the air)
If You are a paraglider pilot it's a no brainer !!!This is the place to stay! The owner (Ketut) is taking care of the fly site and provides tandems and courses as well and He was happy to help us with all information.
The place is ran by his super friendly and kind family, who were always very helpful!
I can only recommend this homestay, definitely coming back !!!",A good place to stay. For paragliding for resting or 10 minutes from many good surfing spots. I recommend,"Beautiful house with beautiful people. I took a paragliding course with Mr Ketut and decided to stay at his homestay which is close proximity to the flying site and the beach. The arrangement is easy and smooth as Mr ketut replies promptly. The house is a beautiful 2 storey building and I stayed on the upper level. The place is kept clean and well maintained. There is a common area for breakfast (which is included), where you get to meet other guests that are staying there. I got to meet a few other students that were learning with Mr Ketut and it was great. There is also a gorgeous pool that is perfect for a morning or evening dip. Mr Ketut and his family members are very friendly, nice and helpful. They also have a dog and a cute cat (which just gave birth to 3 little kittens) that loves to be pat.

If you‚Äôre planning to do a paragliding course in Bali, I recommend Mr Ketut and you should definitely stay at this homestay. If you‚Äôre not doing the course, you can also go for tandem paragliding with his crew. They are all very skilled and friendly, and the view there is amazing."

I had to cut my stay short and the owner had no problem doing that for me and not charging me for the day even though I left after checkout. So kind and so helpful. Also such a beautiful place with a huge bathroom. Would definitely recommend if your looking for a cute quiet stay! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,"Made is sucha wonderful host & he speaks some tagalog (the major philippine dialect) which I find very thoughtful. The rooms itself is very tidy, efficient with working wifi, nice working table, lovely toilet - it‚Äôs an outdoor type. Location is kinda far from Uluwatu town on our estimate vis motorbike is around 15-20 mins drive but all in all I loved the stay its very laid back and very nice people.","UmahOde is located far from the busy streets and noise, but close to some really nice beaches. Thanks to its central location you can explore all the coastline and different beaches. You need a scooter to enjoy the experience.

The place is incredibly clean, quiet and green. The rooms are spacious and bright.

Made, the owner, is a very nice person, friendly and open enough for a nice chat, and professional enough for respecting your privacy. He is always eager to help with anything, and makes you feel as welcomes as at your own home.","I love the way the owner welcome me. He was really friendly. The room was really good too, it's the same with what I see online. This is typically Balinese's house. And in the middle of this area, there is a kitchen. They served us hot water, so you can make your own coffee and tea by yourself. I love this place because it's close to Pandawa beach and Melasti beach.","Words are not enough! This homestay is a real home away from home. We had one of the bigger rooms during our stay and they are so spacious. The bed was so comfy and the area is so quiet means no roosters in the morning and no barking dogs. The bathroom is nice and big and the rainforest shower was nice to have after a day at the beach.
The garden looks so pretty and there are some availabilities to chill and have a coffee which is always there to get and also a fridge which is so helpful in these hot days.
But the biggest special for us was the lovely host Made and his amazing family. We really enjoyed to always have a chat with Made, Tina and sometimes his dad, watchin and playin with the kids. Also Made told us so many interesting stories about hindu culture and other interesting and funny stories about the Bali life. He gave us a lot of recommendations for the area and everything which he recommended was nice. We came 2 times back to UmahOde and I think we've spend more than 3 weeks during our Indonesia trip there and it was the best homestay we had so far.
Thx for everything!"
