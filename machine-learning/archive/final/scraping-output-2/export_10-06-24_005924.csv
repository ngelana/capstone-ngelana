A beautiful slice of tranquil paradise! Gorgeous views of the rice fields,  lovely gardens, great pool. Staff are amazing, it's clean and everything is well tended to. Great food and menu. Thanks for being a highlight of the trip ‚ú®Ô∏è","Nice place to stay, close to Canggu but still possible to enjoy the quietness of Nature. The view of the rice fields is priceless.","Amazing place! We only booked 2 nights and would love to stay longer! We would also be happy to come again, I hope there will be an opportunity to do it in the future. Super friendly and nice staff, the place is well maintained and located in an amazing area. It‚Äôs perfect for relaxing. Nice swimming pool, good food, yoga classes, and cool common area with great ambient music! 100% recommended!","Great place, best stay in Bali that I had with amazing pool area and great rooms on a super quiet and peaceful location next to a rice field, yet close to the beach and Canggu area. Staff is super friendly and I never felt alone although I came on my own. Restaurant has good food and friendly cats. I came back a second time and would come back again! Thanks everyone, and a special thanks to Ferra and Ellaüôèüèº","Just a perfect place to stay in Bali.
Amazing swimming pool area, friendly atmosphere, cozy houses and a lot of nature around. We loved the fact that we could borrow bicycles for free and get to the temple area. They offer also massage and yoga classes. Definitely a place to come back."
