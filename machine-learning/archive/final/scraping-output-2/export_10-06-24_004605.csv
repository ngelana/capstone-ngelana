I love visiting this museum, hanging out in their magnificent garden and watching a brilliant collection of items that is not usually seen in one place. It is literally beautiful museum and very well organized. The antiquities mask of the world are represented here left us in awe. My favorite room was the Paviliun Jepang. The Japanese masks and the display of the Japanese traditional costumes were straight up impressive. I was happy to find out that entry to this amazing place is free considering not much else in the city is. If you have a chance to go, history lovers, students, and everyone else should make a point to visit this remarkable museum.",Free museum set in a beautiful garden within traditional Indonesian buildings displaying thousands of masks and puppets from around the world! One of the best in the world!,This is a hidden gem. This place is a very large estate with many buildings. It‚Äôs a little hard to know where to go but you just go exploring all the buildings. Collections of masks and puppets from mostly Indonesia but also from around world with mostly Asian. Next to nobody was there but the place is kept immaculate. There are some cool wood carver shops nearby to visit too. Had information in English with masks. It was free when I went and seems someone with a lot of money invested in making that place. Great alternative to more popular tourist hotspots.,"I really enjoyed walking through this museum. Wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.

Nice old bali style places with some interesting and beautiful displays.

Would have been great to have a tour guide or a recording bringing to life the history etc.

You could read more about the displays but would take ages to do all of it.

Nice outing and is also Free.",Very good museum of rare masks and wayang (shadowmpuppets). Display in a couple of joglo houses as the museum building which stand on a wide balinese garden. The guide was very informative. It is a recommended place to visit. The opening hours should be longer.

This is where tour guides drop off people.
Food isn't even great. Really dry and tough meat. Tiny portion. Tripled the price of other local restaurants.
You get a nice view of the ricefield. Decent customer service.
Not worth the money. Should definitely avoid when possible.
Tourist trap practice and shops like this will kill tourism in Bali.","We had lunch here after visiting a waterfall. It was 14:30 but still many people in the restaurant. We could tell that it was touristy.

Food wasn‚Äôt great. Chicken curry was made for tourists, not tasty at all. But grilled tuna in a banana leaf was good.

Drinks were ok.

The view of the rice field was good though.","This warung was recommended by our driver. The place is very pretty, we were welcomed by a lady who gave us a flower behind our ear :) the employees were very friendly and nice, food prepared quickly. We all liked the drinks (fresh) and  food, mushroom soup was very good and it was a big portion, kids enjoyed their pasta, the fried duck was very tasty, but as few others wrote, there was almost no meat, that's why I am giving less stars as this was the dish the restaurant was recommended for.",The food is disgusting and it‚Äôs twice the price you pay at a normal restaurant in Ubud. 70K for a salad roll that was 90% lettuce and had smelly shrimp!

Beautiful place, only ten minutes for driving into the city. Could lend a scooter while being there.
My favorite place: the tiny but fantastic pool!
Would defenitely recommend!!","The property is a hidden little gem! It is in a quiet area but close enough of Ubud, the rooms are super spacious, clean and very nice, with beautiful views and a very cute swimming pool! And the best part is the owner, she is super attentive, helpful and kind, has gone above and beyond with our requests and you can see she truly wants to make sure all her guests are happy, and we definitely were very happy! Just booked our next stay with them because of how much we liked it!","We really enjoyed our stay here, good price, spacious room with simple kitchen for a quick meal. With jungle views and during the night it‚Äôs noise free! Ms.Wayan took great care of us during our stay too! She‚Äôs so sweet!! We cannot appreciate more!

They also rent scooter at a reasonable price!

The only downside is the wifi cannot reach the balcony but it‚Äôs not an issue as we have 4G. And the bed was a bit hard for us. Overall, we‚Äôd highly recommend this place for Ubud!",Wayan the owner is very friendly und you can ask her anything! The drive to Alam Grigis between the ricefields is stunning! The Room was very nice and spacious. The Bed was comfy with nightstands at each side and two little lamps. A big Wardrobe to put in your clothes. In the bathroom you have a big warm shower. But the best is the view to the ricefields and the nature. At the evening you have a beautiful sunset view! All in all it was a really nice stay here!

The garden is really lovely and the pool even more so! And I loved that it was close to the center of Ubud but in a quiet area!
Bottom line is: if you‚Äôre looking for nice rooms in Ubud, go to Sari Murni!","We had a really nice stay at Sari Murni! The rooms were so pretty and clean. We also loved the beautiful garden and the pool. It‚Äôs really nice to stay a little bit away from the busy Ubud city center. With a scooter or grab you can easily go to the city center. We absolutely loved the host, she is so nice and helpful. There is a shared kitchen, space where you can do some work and good laundry service. You can get fresh young coconuts for a good price and there is a nice local warung in 1 min walking distance to get some lunch or dinner. Would definitely stay here again! üíö","Wow- we had an amazing week at Sari Murni!

Our hostess was just fantastic. She booked the most unreal experience of hiking Mount Batur for us and also an amazing cooking class too. Anything we needed help with - taxis, scooter hire etc, she helped us with - all for great prices and cheaper than you‚Äôd find anywhere else.

The room was beautiful, clean and well kept. The garden area is so tranquil and peaceful.

The area around is quiet, away from the busy Ubud center. If you want to get to the center, it is a 15/20 min ride away so you would need a scooter or grab taxi. We ended up doing a lot of driving whilst there as there isn‚Äôt much to walk to close by but we did not mind at all as we preferred the quiet neighbourhood :-)

We would recommend again and again. We were so happy with our stay. Thank you!!!","A really wonderful piece of paradise in Ubud.
Liked: Made, the owner has put a lot of effort into designing this guesthouse. The room was so nice and comfortable, my wife and I loved sitting on the balcony listening to the sounds of the area. We slept really great, the room was quiet and dark. There is a kitchen you can use, though we did not, and unlimited free filtered water. The garden and the pool were excellent, best pool of my whole Bali trip. I very much doubt you will be disappointed if you stay here.
Disliked: Only really small complaints, and maybe not worth mentioning, but some things could be made a bit quieter, like some of the doors. And this one is not really their fault, but the alleyway to the house is super narrow and steep, it was a bit sketchy getting in and out. if you‚Äôre walking out getting a ride this would not be a problem, only if you have your own scooter like I did.","Madi, the hostess has been of great care with us. She welcomes you with a warm smile into her newly-decorated, private guest house. Sari Murni only counts 5 rooms, a very green garden and a pool, as well as a kitchen free to use with all cooking tools provided. You can also rent a scooter for a very reasonable price (70K per day).

The rooms are very clean, spacious, and modern. The same goes for the bathroom, and you'll also enjoy a private, peaceful balcony.

Sari Murni is located in a peaceful street, and is only 20 minutes away from the rich and buzzy Ubud center, which makes it the perfect relaxing gateway. Also, if you decide to stay there, there's a very good Warung (Local restaurant) called Mom's Kitchen, only 3 minutes south by walking, for when you don't feel like going back to the city."

We got 3 bedroom villa with pool and kitchenette. It has the most beautiful pool and outside patio where you can enjoy the view and relax. The bed was super comfortable, bathroom is modern and beautiful. First we got two nights only, as we weren‚Äôt sure if we like the place, but after one night we decided to extend! Fortunately somebody canceled their booking so we stayed for another 3 amazing nights. We didn‚Äôt even want to leave the villa so we ordered our dinners using Gojek. We would stay longer, but it was already booked. Made and his team are the nicest people, they really made our stay special. Breakfasts were delicious, eggs cooked to perfection, authentic breakfasts full of flavor. The villa is hidden, but it‚Äôs a gem. After Anggira, we couldn‚Äôt really enjoy other villas.
