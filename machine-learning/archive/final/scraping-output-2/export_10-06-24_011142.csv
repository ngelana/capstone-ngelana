So there were fewer people, and in the 2 hours I spent there, not one other person got there except me.
Here you need to go through the path at the end of pandan beach. After reaching a platform, walk along the left side and you will see the way down.
If you are good at climbing mountains, it will be easy for you.","Such a nice beach!! Harder to get to but worth it. You have to drive to the bend in the road and then walk along the path. Takes about 15 mins. As the path starts to go down the slope there is an unfortunate path of used plastic bottles that we followed.
The water was crystal blue but had a big current so be very careful when swimming","This was the most beautiful beach we have been on the island… it’s worth the hiking down there and we had a local person out of nowhere to help us get there. Be careful and wear good shoes, don’t worry you won’t get lost. Enjoy your private beach","This was my second stop on Christmas day and glad i did the hike. Probably the most treacherous walk i have done on Penida. But in saying that i did it the day after a cyclone.

The hills in the area have not been altered for tourists, but i did it in bare feet and it was about a 30-45 minute hike from Crystal.

Once there i did not see a soul, beautiful spot. The water is too rough to go deep, but a nice spot to float knee deep.","The path to get there is NOT easy. if you do not hike, don’t go. if you don’t have closed shoes, don’t go. you will need both hands to help you during the way, so don’t bring anything that you cannot put on a backpack. it is a nice beach, but the hiking was responsible for a big part of our great experience. Water was not good to swim - especially compared to Crystal bay and Pandan."

This will lead you to Pandan Beach. There are lots and lots of stairs to go up, then a straight trail, follow it, then again lots and lots of stairs to go down to the beach. There is only one warung there that sells coconut for 30k, so did not buy it. I have had young ones for 15k to 20k. So this is like double the amount. There is a swing and it is not a very well-known place. So there were only 12 people I think when I was there for like 2 whole hours. It was peaceful. Must visit if you can do the walking and climbing for 20 minutes or so.",,,,
