Came here for lunch, the setting is beautiful, the vibe was really chilled out, nice playlist - chilled dance but not intense.

The food was amazing and really fairly priced for Canggu. We had the potato croquettes and the chicken schnitzel Benedict for our brunch. The poached eggs were cooked to perfection and the portion size was really good and filling.

Really nice coffee here too. Just down the road from Milk & Milu which looked much busier and more bottomless brunch vibes.

Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in Canggu.",We choose this place because the view looks cosy in the pictures and indeed it was a lovely place with greenery all around. We celebrated my mom friend‚Äôs bday and the female staff that serves us sing a bday song which was a lovely gesture from her.

They start your service with some tasty iced tea that is quite refreshing. The menu is full of traditional flavors and creative combinations - you cannot go wrong with anything you choose.

We asked for them to make things 'much less spicy' and the staff was happy to help and also pointed out a few menu items we would enjoy based on this request. Everything we ordered was packed with flavor, succulent and so fresh.

Service is lovely, really well priced and great portions!","The food is amazing, especially the clams‚Äîwe ordered two portions. The staff is friendly. The corn cob was tasty, the curry chicken was aromatic with a rich coconut sauce, and the beef cheek was well marinated. The long bean had a unique taste (not to my liking though).

While portions are quite small, they are of high quality. They even serve iced tea as a welcome drink!

Point of improvement: Rice is undercooked, abit hard.","I‚Äôve found dining experiences a bit underwhelming so far in Bali, but this place was good. Good flavours, good service and good price for the quality. I had corn fritters for starters served with lime leaves and a sambhal sauce. The fritters were not greasy at all, but were crispy and the flavour was fab. I had barracuda served in a banana leaf for mains and again, great flavours.

The food was really great with a mixture of flavors, the chicken kyiv was infused with broth and caviar in it, which makes it really tasty. The beef steak had a sour and spicy sauce with it and the grilled octopus was cooked perfectly where it melts in your mouth.

However the dessert was below average - we didn‚Äôt finish it as it was quite dry.","This Cafe is good for a meeting. It's a little bit pricey.

Otherwise, the oyster was fresh, spinach sauce was lovely, the crunchy vegetables complemented the texture perfectly. The Caesar dressing was a little disappointing, the flavor of Parmesan and eggs was strong, but the touch of anchovies was not felt at all. The broccoli steak is beyond criticism, although I would have liked to add more smoky flavor and cook it a little more as it was a little raw inside. Peanut sauce - ten out of ten. The spinach is the most tender. Borscht is the best on the island. Quenelles from lard is delicious and tender, even vegetarians should try it. Pompushki - had a strong egg smell when you would expect a creamy garlic flavor.

Locavore really did a great job on this, will be back soon to J town to taste the OG from Canggu.","Hip bar in canggu area. The cocktails is nice, a bit sweet for my taste, but it's nice if you drink once in a while. Ordered Ashes and Mead, ashes is the way to go if you want something unique. The mead is sweet and fizzy.","If you're really like to enjoy cocktails with chill vibes and very limitless seating capacity, this might be a good option for you to visit if you're in canggu area. Be careful the cocktails are strooooong."

The moment I walked in, I was greeted by the warm and inviting smell of fresh-baked bread and savory dishes. The decor is charming, with a mix of rustic and modern elements that create a cozy yet stylish environment. It's a great spot for a casual lunch or a relaxed dinner.
The menu offers a delightful variety of options. I enjoyed the Squid Ink Tonarelli with prawns at Cibo! the dish was bursting with flavors; the squid ink provided a rich, umami taste that was complemented by the fresh, juicy prawns. The pasta was perfectly cooked, flavoured up with chilli, garlic, white wine, and octopus bottarga, then topped with juicy tiger prawns, Squid Ink Tonnarelli in Prawns Sauce is an ocean of flavour that seafood and pasta lovers should not miss on their visit to CIBO! Bali. The Beef Cheek Brasato is undoubtedly one of the showstoppers in the selection of signature main dishes at CIBO! Bali. Braised overnight in Sangiovese wine, then served with truffled potato puree' and roasted carrots, melt in your mouth and will linger in your memory.  The staff was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. My server was knowledgeable about the menu and offered great recommendations based on my preferences. While a bit on the higher side for a deli, the quality of the food and the overall experience justify the cost. Cibo! offers a delightful dining experience with high-quality food and excellent service. It's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area and looking for a satisfying meal in a pleasant setting.
The background music was a delightful mix of classic Italian tunes and modern interpretations, which added to the authentic feel without being overpowering. The layout of the restaurant offers intimate tables for couples as well as larger settings for groups, making it a perfect choice for any dining occasion.
What truly set the atmosphere apart was the attention to detail. Fresh flowers adorned each table, and the soft flicker of candlelight provided a romantic touch, adding an element of excitement and authenticity to the dining experience.
The staff contributed significantly to the ambiance as well. They were dressed nicely and greeted us with warm, genuine smiles. Their friendly, attentive service made us feel like valued guests rather than just customers.
Overall, Cibo offers a perfect blend of ambiance, decor, and hospitality, making it an ideal spot for anyone looking to enjoy a memorable Italian dining experience. We will be back for sure!
Love, Bunny","First of all, shout out for Nova! His service is exceptional, genuine smile, very thoughtful and he always makes sure that we have a good time at the restaurant. The food, the drinks and the atmosphere are super nice, I‚Äôve been to this restaurant for few times and always come back here for their Beef Cheek Ravioli ‚ù§Ô∏è","Went to CIBO on a public holiday and it was great Italian food despite being spoilt for a decade by my wife's Nonna. Had the Burrata, Croquettes and Focaccia as the entre. Burrata was a bit too solid in the center but the tomatoes and dressing was amazing. The Croquettes were missing their potato and tasted super salty with excess ham. Focaccia was lovely. Kids had rainbow pasta but were disappointed in the colors! Eventually I got them to eat some. The prawn pasta was great and the lasagna too. Beef ravioli was very pasty and didn't really taste like beef at all. Gelato was great. Tried to use the Perth entertainment book voucher and they didn't know how to process it which was disappointing and they gave us an unusable voucher (only valid for 3 months). The setting is really nice with a garden outside and a comfortable interior. The service scores down a couple of marks only because of the voucher and the warm beers that were served even though our servers were lovely and attentive. Prices are reasonable generally speaking and the quality of food good.","Food in this place is very delicious, especially pasta, I forgot to take a photo of the pasta because I ate it straight away, they portions are also bigger than regular pasta. I will definitely come back to eat here if I go to Bali. The chef is incredibly friendly ‚ù§Ô∏è and the place is very comfortable, at dinner the atmosphere is very romantic. You should come here with your loved ones ü´∂","I AM SO IN LOVEEEEE WITH THIS PLACE! This place has always been my favorite in Bali ü•∞ü•∞ The best Italian cuisine !

If you‚Äôre looking to stay somewhere in Canggu I would 100% recommend Adepa!,"Adepa resort is a beautiful hidden gem in Canggu that you need to check out while in Bali.
Me and my sister were very satisfied with the services and the villa we booked. Breakfast was amazing, they made beautiful floating breakfast and afternoon tea which really elevated our experiences.
I would love to thank all the lovely staffs for being so nice and helpful during our stay. We booked the tours with them and were very happy with the friendliness, mindfulness that Wira Nata-the most awesome tour guide has given us. Very reasonable price with such outstanding services.
We will be back :)
thank you so much, Adepa team.
Krystal and Tam","Adepa Resort is an awesome spot to stay and relax in Bali. We lived room layout, the pool and the bed.

The only thing people might beed to know is that you cannot walk from the Villa anywhere with ease. It is best to book a Grab bike or hire a car or something because the road is too narrow and busy when you walk off the street. However the Villa itself is quiet.

I would highly recommend it for anyone who is confident with getting around Bali.",Bad experience with this Resort. The private swimming pool filtration was broken and water was dirty. We did not use it during the entiere stay. Fountain was broken with stagnant water (mosquito nest). The room was dirty. Washbasin was leaking. Shower was plugged and not clean everyday. Very dirty restaurant. Breakfast was not good. It is like the Resort was abandoned. Lack of personnel and not very dynamic. I do not recommend this Resort.

Not too much vibe. But perfect for lunch :)","Absolutely loved Secret Spot Berawa! The highlight for me was their entire menu being vegan-friendly, perfect for vegetarians like myself.

Villas incredibly spacious, felt very private whilst still being in a great location. Very close to a lot of popular restaurants (next door to Ulekan which is best local food you will find in Canggu) and only a 5 minute scooter into heart of Canggu. The staff were impeccable, available 24 hours a day and attended your room twice each day. Great air conditioning in bedroom. Mosquito nets in bed although was barely needed when we were there, plus they come and spray any before bed if needed. Perfect balance between staying at a large resort and a private villa. Highly recommend and will be coming back.","The room was big and the facilities were great. The mirror in the dressing room was big, so it was good to take pictures.

This 90 mins floating session in warm salt water is so relaxing and soothing. You can choose songs for the float session or even guided meditation. This session really improves my sleep quality. You can just relax and chill, take a nap, or meditate during the float like I did. Had an exquisite meditation here inside the tank, floating is surely a doorway to deeper meditation. The post float service is also lovely. They have a nice lounge where we can get our complimentary tea or coffee and also fruit + protein balls. Definitely will come back here!!","I cant imange how relaxed my body is.
