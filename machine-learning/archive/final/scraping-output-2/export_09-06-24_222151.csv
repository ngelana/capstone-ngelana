Tejakula, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81173, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=10668309543446175504,OPERATIONAL,+62 623 6232033,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.5,261,,"Just spent 7 amazing nights at Spa Village & Resort in Tembok. Most won‚Äôt make the 3 hour journey by car to this magical location on the north side of Bali. This is their loss. Spa Village is the most magical location for those wanting a truly secluded, relaxing getaway. It‚Äôs the little things that make this place so special. Firstly there is the amazing ambiance of this beachfront hideaway. The pool area is perfect and they would reserve the same daybed for us each day.
Then there is the staff. They just can‚Äôt do enough for you and know you by name from day one. The food is great and our package included a free daily cocktail. Oh, did I mention the daily included spa treatments? I had 6 massages in 7 days. I left this morning so relaxed I can‚Äôt even explain.
If you want to escape the hustle and bustle of daily life for a while this is heaven on earth. I was sad to leave.","We had a villa for our honeymoon. The villa is fantastic, with an infinity plunge pool, gazebo a super large bed... It really is fantastic. It is also very quiet, which is a good alternative to the busiest places. No kid under 16 are allowed btw.
The staff was amazing, very friendly, always available. The massages were also really nice. They tend to be on the stronger side if what you may expect so don't hesitate to ask for medium rather than strong.
The food was very good even if a bit repetitive when we were there (pretty low season). Always good quality though. The wines were very good - all of them!
Great experience!","I stayed here with my partner for 5 nights in May 2024. This was the highlight of our many recent visits to Bali. The journey is 2 - 2.5hrs from Denpasar but the vehicle is super comfortable & luxurious. The trip is a tour in itself, taking you past Kintamani Volcano & through local villages. Check-in begins with a shoulder massage and foot bath whilst the formalities are discreetly seen to. Guests are thengiven a suggested itinerary for the duration of their stay outlining the included activities & treatments such as massages, yoga, weaving, body scrub making. Optional excursions & costs can also be fitted in.  We booked the corner suite which had magnificent views out to sea and over the central grounds & pool. As there are only 31 rooms I think they all face toward the central area & they're furnished in the traditional Balinese style which suits the setting. All massage therapists are experienced & highly trained (I'm quite particular being a therapist myself). Quality of the food and choice was fantastic as were all the staff who greeted you by name wherever you were in resort. The staff were so friendly, personable &  professional - we can't speak highly enough of everyone. Special thanks to Astri & Luh, we can't wait to return. Regards, Jane G -  Sunshine Coast, Australia","5/5 üåü villa resort stay!
Food & service was simple beyond excellent. I‚Äôve just stayed in another 2 room Villa in Bali beginning of the year but this is rly out of the world. Firstly - we literally woke up to the soothing sounds of waves in our Villa everyday and night. We had a private pool and cabana , we didn‚Äôt even need to leave our Villa except for Mealtimes.

PS. All Daily spa and meals are all inclusiveüíØ Bfast  by the pool was such a bonus! All I can say is the staff and very clean villa (except for a few millipedes outdoors) are a main draw. Totally made my 3hr ride in super worth it!","Spent 7 nights here. We upgraded to a private Villa which was splendid. The suites looked large too. Though the regular rooms all have a great view and balcony. The resort was quiet at first, so you can really retreat or make friends with the other residents/staff if you wish. The activities are diverse. The cycling trip to a waterfall was a highlight. All the activities were fun. The spa treatments are superb and something I would never normally do. The menu was gr8, and after 7 days we weren't tired of it."

Takes a while from the airport but man is it worth it üôÇ
Staff is the typical super friendly Balinese style.
Surprises start when you arrive with excellent (should be EXCELLENT) reception service.
Food is excellent with little treats when you least expect them.
The room is modern and extremely clean. Very large and comfortable bed.
The bathroom is larger than most flats in Jakarta ü•π
You can sleep at the sound of the waves.
Even the gecko is friendly üòÅüòÅ you ask nicely and he will let you sleep without any noise.ü§≠
Highly recommended place if you like to have peace and stay away from the city environment.
The list of activities is immense, from trekking (god knows what that is...) to 4x4 adventure passing from diving and snorkeling or even enjoying some without leaving the resort.","A Perfect Paradise
Everything about The Kirana Tembok is outstanding. The resort is quiet and peaceful. Away from the tourist crowds. This small resort offers exceptional service and spotlessly clean facilities. The management and staff work together flawlessly to offer personal service to the guests. The food is top notch and fresh. The room, bed and bathroom were all clean and comfortable. The AC and WiFi work well I was able to have a Zoom meeting on their wifi. The massages I received from Setia in their gazebo overlooking the sea were the ultimate relaxation. We also enjoyed seeing how they make coconut oil, palm sugar and arak on the premises. The warmth and genuine kindness from Dewa, Ani, Gede, Kadek, Lista and all the others working at The Tembok made our first trip to Bali truly special. I hope to stay here again. Thank you.",Beautiful place right on the water. We often come here for breakfast. They open 7am and amazing views. Lots of manicured grass for our 2 daughters to run around on.,"Our three-night stay at The Kirana Tembok hotel was nothing short of a serene escape. Nestled in tranquility, this place felt like a slice of paradise on Earth. The ambiance was serene, offering a haven of peace.
The meticulously landscaped garden and the majestic pool truly added to the beauty of the place. It was a delight to unwind amidst such captivating surroundings.
While the food was decent, it perhaps could have matched the outstanding quality of the ambiance and amenities. Nevertheless, it did not overshadow the overall wonderful experience.","Everything was just perfect. Clean, well-maintained, spacious rooms with comfortable King Koil beds, stunning beachfront views from the restaurant and pool area, and some of the most friendly staff you will ever come across in Bali.

The OPS Manager, Komang, was an absolute delight to meet. He's polite, friendly, and really knows his stuff. His calm, charismatic energy clearly flows through to the staff he looks after.

Kirana Tembok is seriously now my go-to for weekend getaways and highly recommended for anyone wanting to escape the chaos of southern Bali.

I'm really looking forward to returning for some more R&R at this stunning property staffed by beautiful people... 5 stars üåü ü§©"
