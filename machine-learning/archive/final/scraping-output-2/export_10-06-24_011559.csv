Very popular with tourists I guess. Mostly foreigners when we were there.",It is a very famous place for babi ruling. It's always crowded with locals & also tourists. The queue is long when i visit. It's not a well decorated dining place. It's more like a neighbourhood stall kind of concept. Seatings are limited & u might need to share the table if you're in a small group. The dining area is also quite warm. The babi guling rice set tastes average to me. I've tasted a better one.,"This place is never quite. Local delicacy Pork Rice with soup, savoury meat, super spicy red chilis. Most of the time they are quite consistent with the taste, soup is delicious. There are two ques, first que is at the counter to pay. Second que is to take away or to dine in, for dine in simply choose any available table. Close before 4pm","The babi guling here was delicious! The flavors were complex and satisfying. However, the price point was a bit higher than I expected. Additionally, the service was on the slow side, and seating was very limited.

For these reasons, I'd recommend getting your order to go.","""Indulging in a delicious lunch of Babi guling was delightful. The crispy pork, pork soup, pork skin, and their exceptional pork satay were fantastic. Accompanied by Nasi, chili, and flavorful gravy on top, it was an explosion of flavors. Despite the fast consumption, we waited around 45 minutes due to the extensive queue, but overall, it was a fantastic meal and a true local delight."""

All in all, I guess even the suite room is still relatively cheap compared to similar hotels in the area, but you should just get a standard room if you're thinking of staying in the hotel.

It's a budget hotel that doesn't offer much. So, book a room here only if you need somewhere cheap to stay in the area and don't need any amenities like a decent pool or breakfast (they don't serve any).","Stayed in big suite and had to choose it because out of the standard room, once the standard available we could move but no refund.

Parking space is not too large, approx 2 cars and 4-5 bikes so you might need to find another parking spot if you bring your own car, but uber and grab are plenty around the area.","Cheap place for nusa dua, has small pool. Host was nice and friendly, helped us to get a motorbike. Windows look to the small passage, so it was dark inside. Wet rooms caused smelling in rooms, but it wasn't criminal. Wifi was poor, 4g was only outside of rooms on the first floor.",Good place around usa 2 are huge room space..less parking area not so many for vehicles..but well for motorcycles..,"a cheap hotel, but still comfy...
a right place to you who just need a place to sleep around Nusa Dua..."

place gloomy and run down, no lights were on, and cushions were dirty.

ordered pempek, waited a good 20mins+. no other customers. food finally came, not impressive, but not terrible either, wasn't expecting much anyway.

lastly - I think the mosquitoes had better meal than me - sucking our blood dry.","Want to order nasi semur but not available,change to nasi goreng but the cook is still doing errand outside the cafe, lastly i order pempek kapal selam but with they only gave me a very small ammount of cuko, not recommeded for their food service,but the place is quite nice","I wanted to try their coffee based on others‚Äô reviews, but they had no plant-based milk options. I get that their target customers are not vegans (based on their menu) but there are also many non-vegans who are dairy-free or simply like oat coffee. I didn‚Äôt feel like having black coffee so I went on‚Ä¶ too bad because the atmosphere was pleasant.","My husband has been to this place before, and often recommends this place for good coffee in Nusa Dua. While waiting for the afternoon flight schedule, we ended up having lunch here, drinking coffee, tea, ginger tea, snacking of fried bananas and we were accompanied by the owner (as well as barista) Mas Odiet.

Mas Odiet has high passion on coffee and he was sharing his wide experiences about coffee... Wooowüëçüëçüëç

My husband ordered japstyle Ulian coffee. Very good coffee. Because I already drank coffee 2times today, so I chose to order ginger tea (without sugar). We also ordered rawon rice (delicious) and vermicelli meatballs (delicious). For fried bananas if they use ""kepok kuning"", it will be definitely better.

Overall our experience here was amazing.
Great place with homey interior (two thumb for Mas Odiet who designed itüëçüëç)
Great hospitality and great coffee.
So ? Come, try and experience it by yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è","They provide bed and breakfast also with room rate 400k++ rupiahs/night. The coffeeshop itself is a lobby from their hostel.

Love the small and humble lobby. Located right on the roadside, the place pretty strategic.

Their coffee was ok (I tried their iced latte). Plus point for the great playlist when i get thereüëåüèª"
