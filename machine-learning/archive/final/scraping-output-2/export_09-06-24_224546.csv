The hot spring with the backdrop of the mountains was beautiful. Delicious, affordable food with a free breakfast and long opening hours. Drinking water fountains added bonus. Good strong wifi. Great hosts and tenants.

Only negative is the couple of hundred metres of bumpy road to get to it from the main road, especially if you have a two wheeler.","We rented a lodge for three nights. I was a bit under the weather so hiking the next morning was out of the question. The same night Yon, the manger asked us if we wanted to upgrade to the luxury cabin for no extra charge, of course we accepted. We got our own private pool, a bigger cabin and our own sunbeds.
The cabin we first had was also great, so I would recommend going there even if you don‚Äôt expand to the biggest cabin or just to rent a tent for the night.
The food is very good, it‚Äôs simple but very tasty and the property is like a little adventure with a well kept garden and great view.
Thank you Yon and your great staff for giving us the best three days in Bali so far!","A terrific small backpacker style accomodation, what we really liked is that you could stay in their tents while there, they had a range of different size modern tents already set up with bedding and presented in very good condition. And they have a natural hot tub with a great view of the mountain on the other side of the lake. Quite a special place to stay for the night if you‚Äôre exploring the area. Good food at the restaurant as well. It‚Äôs simple food but delicious.","I had an amazing time at black lava hostel. The view and the hot spring water filled pools are outstanding. It was so good to relax there after the mount batur hike. At night you can lay in the hot water and watch the stars as well. The food choice was not huge but yummy and fair prices and totally okay for 2-3 days. We stayed two nights and did the batur hike, though booked through an external company. You can leave directly at the hostel which is great and also from what I heard it‚Äôs a better way to hike (less people too) then when you come from Ubud. The staff was friendly, the bed was comfy and I really liked how fresh the linen smelled. Bathroom was totally okay. I think the whole area is so beautiful there, I didn't have much time but I don't think it's true that there is nothing to do around. You can rent bycicles, electro scooter, motorbikes, Atv's. Also Jeep Tours. And there is also the other mountain across the lake you can hike too. Also many Warungs are available.","Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place or village as there is basically nothing to do apart from Mt Batur.. Stay one night if absolutely necessary. Food was awful $4 for Indomi and $3.5 for burnt chips.. Bed bugs and rats everywhere. Book your guide for Mt Batur elsewhere as it‚Äôs a rip off 450k per person is way too much and you can get it for 350k and a much more sociable/nicer guide.."

The food was incredible and they are super accommodating- breakfast is amazing, try avocado on toast!!!
I would highly recommend this place- 10/10!","Love the ambience, far from city noises, clean place, comfortable bed, magical hot spring with mountain view, delicious breakfast and dinner. One thing i dislike is just the layout of the toilet, it‚Äôs right behind the bed without any dividing wall so we can hear and uncomfortably smell our room mate‚Äôs private business. But other than that, i would happily recommend this place to everyone who needs place to calm your mind",I absolutely love this place. It has amazing atmosphere and views. It is a good place to unwind from your busy life. The service is amazing. Many beautiful sunrise place near by. The tent has good bed and pillows. Too bad the toilet is right behind the bad without ceiling and door. It smells weird. And so many flies around. Almost impossible to sit down still at the restaurant. Please toteme. Do renovation and put door and ceiling in your toilet so it doesn‚Äôt smell weird. I had to go to restaurant toilet to do number 2 as its weird to do it while having room mate in the room without door and ceiling.,"Just had an amazing stay at TOTEME Glamping! From the moment we arrived, we felt welcomed and embraced by nature.
Our tent was not just comfortable but beautifully designed, offering both privacy and stunning views. The highlight was definitely soaking in the thermal pool under the stars‚Äîpure bliss. Meals at the restaurant were delicious, with fresh, local ingredients. üëåüèª

In general nice place, hot spring, cozy atmosphere. Can make a congratulations if Birthday. But the breakfast‚Ä¶ and restaurant‚Ä¶ is awful.
1. Small choice of breakfasts, no tea
2. Scramble I asked - extra charge (and it was too salty).
3. In my Avo with Toast I receive a worm‚Ä¶ also with mayo when asked without.

Swimming pool is not very large but with few rooms also. The only concern is that there AC but no insulation built in. So any noise comes in, and it works only because the temperature is cool enough.
For the mountain climb you get a leg up as this already up. No need for a ride.","This is by far the best place to stay anywhere in the world!

What a stay we had here. The villas, the view, swimming pool, everything just mesmerizing.

DONT BELIEVE SOME OF THE REVIEWS about the way to reach here. It's uphill of around 1.5kms from the main road, but that's how you get the view of hills and the Batur lake. The road is a little bumpy in a small stretch but otherwise drivable. The only problem you would face is almost a vertical slope leading upto the hotel. That's really steep. But you won't necessarily need a 4WD per se. A good car with a fairly better engine will do the trick. Our old Kia Rio was stuck just 5m from the hotel. Any good SUV wont know a thing

A special mention about the staff here. They are the real heroes. They will give you a WhatsApp and you can get anything with a simple ""Hi"". They will spot on the pool and offer you free coffee and tea. They will spot you walking out of the hotel and offer you a drop. Just gratitude for such good people.

Another good thing about this place is that Batur Natural Hot Spring and Toya Devayasa are just outside your descent.

Also, there's a sweet cat which stays around the resort. Try and feed him some snacks, she is really friendly.

Will surely return.",The road is barely accessible by a normal car. 4wd seems adequate to make it here. And be aware that when it rains you're basically stuck here as the horrible road up turns into a river for hours even after the rain. It's too expensive for the value. The sewer smell in the dark bathroom is strong.,"If you are looking for a quiet and beautifully romantic stay, with postcard scenery, then this Breezy Volcano is a must.

Yes, the road is a bit rough on the drive in, and Gojeck & Grab don‚Äôt operate in the area, but they have easy access to drivers, so it‚Äôs a non-issue.

I seriously could not believe how spectacular the view is, and not only from the pool area, from the abundance in glazing in the villas too. A truely magical view to wake up to.","staffs are kind friendly helpful,  nice nature view and spacious room, however due to the flies hardly to open the door to enjoy fresh natural air,  sadly the pool is cold water (not heated pool) and access to the hotel from main road is challenging (takes time)"

Staff were very very extremely kind and helpful and lovely to talk to. Excellent forest walks leaving right from the property. An easy walk down to shops and warung or if you‚Äôre not bothered they provide free drivers often who are very helpful and kind.,"I stayed here for one night. I think it is very good place for short visits.

Advantages:
+ This hotel has an amazing view
+ well-groomed and beautiful territory
+ amazing staff. Very king people.
+ really big rooms
+ hot water
+ help with hiking
+- very high from main road. Good because hiking path right from hotel bad because of bad road.

Disadvantages:
- no cooler with water
- disrespectful attitude to staff (their house on photo. build them the house at least the same as for guests!!)
- awful kitchen and food
- bad road -it is important only because you need to go to grocery because of lack of cooler with water

- it would be great if the pool was hot","Nice place. Well maintained rooms and thumbs up for the cleanliness. Functional bathroom with hot shower. The room was spacious. Our room didn't have an AC or fan but our friend's had a fan and i booked the same room type.
The downside was that there's plenty of flies during the day which was annoying. It's not the fault of the hotel though. I read on other reviews most of the downside was the road/ access to the hotel but we found it quite easy to find, yet indeed the road was not properly asphalt. So watch out for that.
The staff were lovely and helpful. There were choices of breakfast and they're pretty nice.
Would recommend it.
Thanks Batur Green Hill! üëå","Pros :
This place is right where the mount batur hike starts. Nice view from the rooms, and dining area. The rooms are big and bed is comfy. Pancakes were tasty and staff was very friendly and accomodating.
Cons :
We were provided with trek guide who didn't understand English so it was a bit difficult to communicate in the middle of trekking with slippery stones along the trek. He did translated though through the app. The swimming pool could have been heated. There was some insect in the bathroom"

The cabins are basic but good, beed was comfortable, i would recommend bringing some thicker clothes to sleep in, as it is a mountain location and it gets colder at night. Breakfast was good and delicious . I believe it has its value for the money. And I also need to mention the warm water pool that we had a good time towards the end of the day.",Lovely experience with the kids here. A quiet  place to step away for a night or two from the over crowded Cities.,"We booked 3 rooms. The room floor was dusty. I can feel the dust on my feet. One fan is out of order, have been reported but until check out no one comes to fix it. The view was limited. Not a good spot for view. The blanket was thin,  I could still feel the freezing cold air. If you drive a car, be careful, the road is narrow. In the morning a guy cleaned up the pool. In the middle of our activity in front of our cabin, he was just dumping the pool water in front of our cabin where we were gathering. This is not a professional service.",Danny & Tina are amazing hosts who are so helpful & kind. The food is delicious especially the fish - a true local delicacy.

I loved waking up early and enjoying the sunrise behind mt Abang in the pool üòÅ the rooms themselves are on the basic side, but they are clean and comfortable.

HOWEVER, the best part was the hospitality. We accidentally left our phone charger at the place. A few days later, the owner's son delivered it to us all the way in Denpasar üò≠ terimakasih banyak!","Beautiful cabin with view of Mount Abang and amazing Batur lake
Thank you for your hospitality",Balinese owned accommodation. The most incredible couple - we even borrowed money from them. üòÇ we did pay it back but that was a fist for me on all my travels. The accommodation is right at the foot of Mount Batur. It is not in Kintimani. Has a natural hot spring as a pool. They organize everything if you want to hike up the volcano. We had a wonderful experience there. Transport to and from takes a bit of planning. No Grabs or Gojeks but the owner will find you a driver. We had an excellent guide who took us up the mountain. Definitely a highlight of our trip. Thank you. üôè,"TLDR at the end.
Seems to be a family owned business. Excellent staff, very welcoming and friendly. Good communication skills and contacts for activities. The family cooked very nice food and had hot drinks available.
WiFi is good (aussie standards).
Boss fixed my jacket, sewing a button on to the cuff. I offered to pay and he refused. He even allowed me to borrow his tools to fix a problem we had with our scooter.
The place is very clean and well maintained over-all. There is a simplicity and elegance that is evident in person that does not show in photos. Accompanied by truly awesome views of Mt Batur and Mt Agung.
A very well maintained garden, with a variety of plants and pavers for walking paths. Meticulous attention to detail in the garden and landscape. I felt safe walking on the grass, paved, and floored areas with no footwear.
Inside each cabin there are blackout curtains covering sliding glass doors that open to the balcony, with a fan above pointed at the bed. There was an automatic spray with insect repellent and other measures taken to reduce pests.
The bed was comfortable, however I would have preferred a thicker pillow and perhaps some extra blanket as it does get a bit colder in the higher regions. The staff were happy to provide an extra blanket upon request, and I got comfortable with the extra little pillows provided in the room.
The bathroom is more of a wet-room and is spacious enough to share, the water from the hot spring is used for the shower and bidet, and is very warm. I found it to be exactly what I was looking for.
The hot spring pool is very clean and well maintained and is spacious enough for many people to relax. While we were there, at one time there were 6 adults lounging and 4 children playing, and there still was ample room. Not exactly a pool for swimming but more akin to a spa.
Location is great, walkable to street food and convenience stores. Perfect to access sunrise hike to Mt Batur (can also recommend this).

3 of us stayed between 2 cabins for 2 nights and we all had an excellent time. I could not place any higher recommendation for Manik Tirta Cabin's. Thank you again to the family for making us feel so welcome by maintaining a simple, elegant accommodation and for catering to our needs. Terima Kasih üôè"

Groetjes Lars en Pernilla","I used the taxi service to go to Ubud from Kintamani. It was such a relief to book a private taxi driver from there because there is no Grab taxi in Kintamani and roads are quite tough to drive for strangers.
Mr.Amet( Maybe the driver's name?) was very kind and drove the car gently.
It was very pleasing to talk with you!","Scammer on the phone we agreed on a price with there boss and upon arrival the driver an old rude man asked for DOUBLE!

And when i called the BOSS he lied about the price we agreed on.

SHAMEFUL for you i wouldnt mind paying double if thats what we agreed on.

Instead he wants to feed his kids scam money.

The rude old driver was beeping and honking and shouting at people in the street upon arrival to ubud saying he doesnt like tourists well thats why you expect in ubud.

He even shouted at me and cursed even before arrival and having the money issue.

Hes disgusting. And the company BEWARE"
