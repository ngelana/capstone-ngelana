ChIJkY2FTcY_0i0RsyHFhk8VSKc,Bumi Linggah Villas Bali,-8.6170147,115.2631143,"Jl. Pasekan Jl. Raya Banjar Tubuh, Batubulan, Kec. Sukawati, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80582, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=12053907833964798387,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 8461747,,"bed_and_breakfast, hotel, lodging",4.1,194,,"We were here last week for 2 nights. It was really good experience. Villa was beautiful. Swimming pool was clean. We enjoyed.

Pros-
1. Quick room service.
2. Very clean.
3. Polite and kind staff.
4. We get Indian chai. It's rare to get Indian chai in Bali.

Cons-
1. Same breakfast everyday!
2. Lizards everywhere. Especially in dinning hall. Beside the food tray, on the plates, spoons. This was the worst part !","Located in silent place away from city rush and crowd, you can find peace here. Surrounded by greenery all over the villas you will get forest vibe  and will find yourself in the middle of forest.

In villas, you will have a private pool (although not that big) enough for 2, private hall for lunch and watch tv (No channels were available) and private bedroom with attached washroom having jacuzzi.

Food options is limited & you will find insects because of greenery (JUST BE AWARE). Rest everything was perfect during my stay.","Rooms are in dire need of renovation. Glass door came out of panel. Luckily we were not hurt. One chair broke when one of us sat on it. Very poor quality furniture. Bathroom area is dirty and not well maintained. Staff are good, cooperative and ready to help. Breakfast menu has no variety.","The villa is perfect for stay. The staff was very friendly. We required Jain food, so the staff immediately made us something available, suitable to us. They were very friendly and helpful to us.

However there were red ants, flies and earworms all over inside the villa, especially in the bathroom area. The house villa is fluorished with greeneries, that might be the reason. But it was nearly impossible to move freely in bathroom area. Some maintenance needs to be addressed to the plants and trees as it was a hurdle for sitting nearby the pool.

Also there are supermarkets nearby, making it a good location.",No maintenance... rooms are different from what shown on booking process..old furniture..less light at night very scary.. pools are not good..just do not book by website photos.. actually the villas are not maintained..wasted my 2 days in these property.... disappointed üòî

Very friendly guys from the Mepatingan Bali team will help you to relax and free your madness outside.  The traditional martial arts of Bali imply a fight in the mud, which is incredibly fun!  This is a very cool place with a relaxing atmosphere.  In addition to fighting practice and dancing, you will receive a sauna, a relaxing massage and a delicious meal and coffee.  Highly recommend!  There were even Kim Kardashian and David Copperfield, try it and you!",I visited as part of a school trip and the children loved it! All the staff were very attentive and friendly. Both teachers and Children were very well looked after. I could see the place was used to having school programs as all activities were very engaging and the transition between the games were very smooth. The staff were very accommodating and the place was fully equipped. Overall a fantastic day! I highly recommend! Thank you,"Best mud, best staff in Bali
