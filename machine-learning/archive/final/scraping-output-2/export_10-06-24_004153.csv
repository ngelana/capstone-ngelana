The resort offers a lot of privacy with its expansive grounds and immaculate gardens, and only 20 units of villas / suites. Service is top notch, from the reception to butlers and everyone on site has a smile to offer everywhere you go, while observing subtle nuances - incredible.

We stayed in the one bedroom pool villa, and everything was perfect.

We absolutely loved our stay, and would definitely look forward to coming back. Thank you for an amazing time!","A hidden 5 star gem. Definitely worth a meal or a stay. We did not stay but enjoyed appetizers, dinner and a controlled hot air balloon ride which included a photo memory.

If you are seeking for luxury and good place to stay, far far away from the city, tanah gajah is definitely a choice for you.

Lush green lawns, water bodies with Swans and personalised service, Tanah Gajah is an experience not to be missed.

20 exclusive Villas designed by Hadi Prana; an Architect. The interiors of the Villas and the furniture have been very tastefully designed.
In the room for evening tea, the life of Hadi Prana is beautifully depicted.
Small details like creation of a Whatapp group the moment you arrive ensure personalised service with instant responses. The Shuttle service to Ubud is an added feature.
The food for vegetarians is however a bit limited. However if you pre book an order the previous evening, they try their best to make it for you.

Highly recommend a stay at the Tanaj Gajah!","Without a doubt this was the best hotel experience I‚Äôve ever had. The villa had a beautiful private pool overlooking rice fields, and they had outdoor tubs as well as stunning interior bathrooms. The service was so kind, when we forgot to take out packaged leftovers home from dinner at the hotel restaurant, a service member brought it back to our villa. Truly outstanding hotel."

This place is truly a hidden gem, traditional with luxurious touch of home away from home.","This beautiful oasis is located outside of Ubud proper, so you will need a car or scooter to access, as there's nothing available within walking distance. Overall however, absolutely stunning! NOTE: The entrance to the hotel looks like just a small parking covered parking area, and the walkway is in the back. A little hard to find. The service was impeccable, and the owner very responsive via WhatsApp. The rooms were tidied daily, and breakfast was included in the price.

Two notes to mention - one, I ordered dinner one night, and the food was okay, but not great. Breakfast however was delicious every day!! Two, this place is located in the jungle, and there will be bugs/geckos in your room. I didn't mind, as I've been travelling around Bali for a few weeks and was used to it, but there were definitely visitors in my room and bathroom the entire time. Gecko waste found on clothes and bags that were left out of closets, and I had to fight off a huntsman spider and a waterbug in the bathroom before showering while there üòÇ

Overall tho, the place is fantastic (the pool was so refreshing during the hot part of the day!) and the location isolated, but comfortable. Service friendly and amazing. Highly recommended!","Good things- Excellent room service, too good host(always smiling and ready to help),good food and lovely property. You will hear the birds chirp every morning!!!

Things I didn‚Äôt like- Awkward location(too far from main area), Dont expect it to be a formal hotel,it is like a airbnb with 4 properties side by side in same location, lighting in the room could be better (feels dark entire time)","Living like royalty!

Private pool with outdoor shower and kitchen, huge king bed, a bathroom as big as the bedroom with the biggest tub I‚Äôve ever experienced.

From the moment I stepped foot onto the lush grounds, I felt embraced by the serene beauty of Ubud's tropical landscapes.

The accommodations at Amori Villas were beyond luxurious. My private villa was a sanctuary of peace and comfort, with a beautifully appointed living space and a semi outdoor bathroom was truly something else.  The pool was to die for and from here you were surrounded by breathtaking views of the rolling green valley. Every detail was thoughtfully curated to create a haven of relaxation and tranquility.

The experienced yoga and meditation sessions provided by local experts, actively nourished our minds, bodies, and souls.

The staff at Amori Villas were exceptional in their hospitality and attentiveness. From arranging personalized experiences to ensuring that every need was met with care and efficiency, they truly went above and beyond to make my stay unforgettable.

I left the Goddess Rising Retreat feeling rejuvenated, empowered, and deeply connected to myself and the beautiful souls I had the privilege to share this journey with.

I cannot recommend this retreat venue highly enough and look forward to returning for another enlightening experience in the future.""","There isn‚Äôt enough time and space to express my deepest gratitude for my stay here at Amori.

The massages they offer are nothing like I‚Äôve ever experienced in the US; the Ayurvedic massage was my favorite. The food was always fresh and delicious, and made with the utmost love. The property itself was like a dream to me, clean rooms, filtered water readily available, yoga shala size was spacious, and the pool was amazing to get into. Thank you again to the Amori staff for adding to the bliss I experienced during my stay in Bali.","Mum and I had a lovely stay at Amori Villas! It‚Äôs a quiet, peaceful spot with stunning views from the dining room and infinity pool. The staff and managers were super friendly, and made us feel at home.

They were very accommodating, always down for a chat, and even made us a takeaway breakfast for our 2am trip to Mount Batur. Thank you!

The villa is 5 minutes bike ride from Ubud town. Grab is available 24/7 to the villa. The road to the villa is an inside road so it‚Äôs not obvious where the hotel is from the road, but it‚Äôs beautiful inside the gates!

There‚Äôs a lovely open yoga space at the bottom of the stairs that you can use to do your own routine or they‚Äôll book a teacher for you.

I‚Äôll definitely be back next time! ‚ò∫Ô∏èThank you Mozie and all the staff who gave us a wonderful experience!","I had such a magical stay at Amori Villas, it‚Äôs truely a hidden gem and I couldn‚Äôt recommend it more highly.

Super overrated prices that can‚Äôt be explained by the quality of the food or the service (service was good and friendly but same as you have everywhere in Bali!). The location in the ricefield is very pleasant but we left still feeling hungry as there was nothing in our plates. I don‚Äôt recommend.,"Amazing property surrounding the restaurant, walking to and from the restaurant was the highlight of the evening. The rice fields are very relaxing and nice. However the resort do balloon rides just next to the restaurant which is a bit noisy and distracting, but they stop once the sun sets.

We had the international degustation menu which was okay for most parts, but it was not very refined or interesting if you are a foodie. It's feels more like a few sample plates of regular restaurant menu items compared to a specially crafted degustation menu. Drinks are quite expensive for Bali when comparing with high end restaurants and 5* resorts.","We had an over the moon experience at The Chedi restaurant in Bali. It was an unforgettable dinner in the middle of the rice fields.

It will cost around $200 for a 5-course couple's romantic dinner. The food was excellent and so was the service.

A couple of tips:
1- Time you arrival right before sunset as I believe it is the best time to have this experience.
2- Make sure you order anti mosquitos spray before your legs start itching üò¨. They'll eat you alive!
3- Communicate any food allergies/restrictions before your arrival.","Incredible experience eating at the Chedi Club. The food was great and the service was top notch. PRO TIP: the restaurant is on a rice field, be sure to put some repellant on, this is a must.","Please, for the love of Bali, do not eat here. We got there at 5:30pm and was told dinner menu does not start till 7pm, but that we can eat off the lunch menu. We get the lunch menu and was SHOCKED at the prices. We crossed our fingers and ordered anyway since the reviews were so good. I thought that the food will reflect the prices. Wow, we were so wrong.

We got two appetizers, the Sate lilit and papaya salad with grilled prawns. One main, seafood curry. For drinks a small bintang and non-alcoholic mango lassi.

We asked for the food to come out as prepared, not all at once. But they brought it all out at once anyway. As soon as the food was set down, we were swarmed by flies. By the time they got the candles lit, it was too late. We lost our appetite since the flies touched every food item on the table. That's ok, they can't control the flies, but they could have not brought it all out at once, like asked, and lit the candles beforehand like they do at every other restaurant in Bali. Maybe the food will still taste good, right?

Did we really just spend 200k on FOUR shrimps and bland papaya salad?? Lilit were so small it was one bite each. But the worst offense was the seafood curry. I've never had curry so bland and watery. For 300k you would think it would at least taste good.

When we were done with the meal, it became very awkward since they probably could tell how upset we were from the meal being only half eaten. They offered complimentary ice cream which was good, but could not redeem the 1,000k we just wasted on the meal. So sad since this was our last meal in Bali. We wanted to splurge and get a really nice farewell meal. We were severely disappointed since we've been consistently getting very good meals everywhere else for less than 500k. What a scam."

Bad mistake, expensive and not good. The view and the music are nice.","We came just for a quick drink with the view. Sadly the quick part was wishful thinking. It took more than 20 minutes before we got our drinks (Iced latte and Italian soda). The drinks were so-so, the view was spectacular, But the waiting time, and the steep prices really put a damper on the whole ordeal."

Good vegetarian options.. Spicy Fried Eggplant a must try..

NEGATIVE - Only accepts Cash. Could be due to network issue and location..","We were taken here as part of our tour, and found that we were the only people there. The food was tasty but small portions, and expensive for what it was compared to other local eateries. Not a bad place to go given the view but maybe better for an evening meal with a larger group if looking for finer dining, but not so much as a couple traveling Indo.","Worst eating experience in Bali so far. The mi goreng was horrific and the soup looked like instant noodles with some broth for the ‚Äúspecial‚Äù taste. The service was not good either. The Mi Goreng came 15 min earlier than the soup after a total waiting time of 45 minutes. The prices are like stars in the sky. Never seen something so high.

If you want to step into a scam - here is the way to eat","Nice place, very tasty food.. love it
Located beside the petanu river, near the elephant cave temple, you can enjoy your breakfast and lunch here. They have nice coffee and so many variants of foods. Balinesse, indian and western cuisine available here. Dont worry if you are vegetarian, they also have the vegetarian meals.. come and enjoy your lunch here..","Food was absolutely tasteless, tiny portions with zero flavour and very expensive considering how terrible the food is!!! Only nice thing are the views but 0/10 would recommend eating here unless you enjoy bland food and packet noodles :///"
