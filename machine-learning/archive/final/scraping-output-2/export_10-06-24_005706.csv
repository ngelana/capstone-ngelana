We received a yummy welcome drink once we arrived inside the Park and then we were taken on a little walking tour before we headed to dinner. With the Dinner you had a choice to sit inside or out. We chose inside as we could sit and watch the lions through the glass which was beautiful.  The food was the same no matter were you chose to sit and it was a yummy buffet. So many choices and it was really nice. We loved the food. We loved the fire dance and our 8 year old son was just mesmerised but it. The best part of course was being put in a cage on the back of the truck and having lions jump up on the side and tigers jump on top of the cage. We got to feed elephants, zebras,  cows, camels and we saw Giraffes and rings as well. It was AMAZING. So woth the price. I would suggest booking online before you go so you don't drive all that way and find out they are fully booked the day we went they booked out. Book online the. Hire a driver to take you there and back.
The staff are amazing and so helpful.","The zoo is really spacious, and the staff is super friendly. There are many animals to see. I expected to see African elephants, but sadly, they weren't there. The place is very well-maintained and clean for a zoo, though there are some smells from the animals. Unfortunately, all the food and drinks are very expensive. I spent a lot of money just on ice cream (I came with my best friend), and the total cost was more than the entrance ticket üò≠",Highly recommend visiting this safari and paying extra for the private jeep through the park. You get to feed the animals from the car and get incredibly close  to some of the animals. The shows are also well presented; showing how some animals are facing extinction in Indonesia.,"Had such a great time here!

We took the private experience 4x4 jeep to feed the animals for 1M Rp, so worth it - highly recommend!!

thereafter we went for the tiger presentation with a very interesting concept.

We ended our day with feeding the meerkats and hanging out with the parrots.

What an amazing day!","Bali Safari is an incredible zoo experience that goes beyond expectations. Set in the lush landscapes of Bali, it's more than just a typical zoo‚Äîit's a wildlife adventure. From the moment you step in, you're transported into different habitats, where you can observe majestic animals roaming freely in environments that mimic their natural habitats. The variety of species is astounding, from big cats to exotic birds, elephants, and more.

What sets Bali Safari apart is its commitment to conservation and education. You can engage in various interactive experiences, like feeding giraffes or getting up close with baby animals, all while learning about their behaviors and conservation efforts. The safari journey itself is a highlight, where you embark on a thrilling ride through different zones, encountering animals from around the world.

The facilities are top-notch, with spacious enclosures that prioritize the animals' welfare while providing visitors with excellent viewing opportunities. There are also dining options within the park, allowing you to refuel while enjoying stunning views of the wildlife.

Overall, Bali Safari offers an unforgettable experience for animal lovers of all ages. It's a place where you can immerse yourself in the beauty of nature, learn about conservation, and create lasting memories with family and friends. If you're visiting Bali, don't miss the chance to embark on this extraordinary safari adventure."

Well worth the stay there to experience the magic of the place, but don‚Äôt expect much of the food.","Amazing!!!! We absolutely loved out stay here!! The zoo was wonderful, restaurant/service/food is first class. The accommodation is beautiful. Cocktails in the pool, night safaris, and dinner + shows right by the lions - everything was wonderful. The staff are so helpful with absolutely everything, and the transport by golf cart from rooms to the lodge was very convenient. The family room is so spacious, perfect for relaxing between adventures. We can't wait to go back!!","It was great experience, kids will love it. Amazing service and lot to explore.

Just a feedback to management to change timings of water play zone as its from 10:30 to 17:00 however check in time is 14:00 and checkout is 12:00 so we do not get time to explore water play zone with all other activities across the property, also the lady receptionist is bit rude all other staff were exceptionally good. I would really like to visit again.","We enjoyed our family vacation at Mara River Safari Resort. The staff were hospitable, and the lion view during breakfast was a special touch. The jungle safari was exciting, and feeding zebras from our room was a unique highlight. The room could have been cooler, but overall, it was a great experience!","Great experience for families.safari was fantastic and the kids loved the shows and petting zoo! Worth mentioning Mardita at the front was fantastic and always very helpful which made our stay even more pleasant. Food at restaurants were all good! Service great.

Their restaurant provides lot of good food options.,"NOT A SAFARI. It's a zoo, a decent one. Some close encounters with animals in very small enclosures (some via a rushed bus ride, which I guess makes them call it a ""safari""). Nice restaurants (one where you can eat next to lions), almost no air-conditioned places to rest or eat (other than lion restaurant). Western prices for most things, (e.g. 400k for some mains). Not sure if the value for money is there, but the shattered promise of a Safari was enough to make me feel scammed. It's an average zoo, like most zoos in major cities around the world, only much more expensive than any other activity in Bali. Go there only if your expectations are of a standard zoo.",We‚Äôll worth the money. Great time. Up close encounters with wide range of animals,"The place is well designed, lots of shade and wonderful shows. My kids enjoyed it very much!"

If you are a foodie avoid at all cost.","Just awesome üëèüèªü§© this experience is worth to try. Whether you are the hotel guest, safari visitor or you just wanna try any meal with lions. Also there are different meal packages with giraffes and African animals. All worth to try.
We were the hotel guest and our hotel reservation included breakfast so we tried the breakfast with lions, the buffet was completeüëåüèº we tried lunch and also in the evening we tried the bar and dinner and again it was good. Not only you can see the lions but also when safari tours come to the lions you can watch others experience and encounter with lion feedings,

We had a wonderful time and enjoyed just about everything about the whole experience.
The staff had a wonderful birthday surprise for my missus, the food was delicious and the show great.
If I would not book premium but only the regular, I am not sure if I would rate that positive.
The first 45 is just an acoustic combo on the stage, which is nice when you have the dining-experience there, but otherwise you just watch other people eat.

The Varuna Show itself is something like just under an hour and very entertaining. I would have wished for the aquarium to be included more, but it is still impressive.

I would have some more critics about what is included in the ticket-price, but that would not be Varuna related.

The PR department of Varuna needs to step up their game a little. We could not book in Kuta at any agent we asked and many people (tourists) we talked about the show didn‚Äôt even know it existed. ..
...and we were in a hotel, with guests middle and upper age, who can afford it, they were stunned by the pictures we showed them, and asked how to book.

We made a small video of our visit at Varuna, which gives a better impression than just pictures.

To commit a visitor to a certain amount? Then no water for kids, or for refill, must buy bottle, even though the park claims 'sustainability' - translation: sustainable profits.

Better to go to Bali Zoo.","We went there with kids ordered few drink before we order food.

So we explained to the guy and he brought another staff who was very rude and ruin our day at the safari. She told us the transaction was cancelled. We showed her the history of transaction and she blamed us my husband took out the card before it showing transaction approved even we saw the transaction approved on the card machine. Also it was the staff who got our order and took out the card from the machine! She was staring at my husband and told him it is our fault.
She brought their manager and we had to explain again show them the transaction. We were too tired and kids were exhausted so we didn‚Äôt want argument. So we said we are just going to leave whether the transaction is gojng to be cancelled or not and said we didn‚Äôt want that drinks. The manager said the drinks are already made and the transaction will be cancelled, he said he is sure 90% for that and don‚Äôt write a bad review. Next day the transaction was cancelled. And I found out 2days later the transaction was made again even we didn‚Äôt have the drink. How can they cancel the transaction and make it again even it‚Äôs not their card?
