From the moment we arrived, the hosting family and their incredibly friendly staff made us feel like part of their own with unparalleled warmth and hospitality. The villa itself is stunning, nestled in a picturesque setting that relaxes the mind and delights the senses. Every room was impeccably clean, beautifully furnished, and offered all the comforts of home along with some luxurious extras.

The staff was attentive, efficient, and always smiling, adding to the warm and welcoming atmosphere. Breakfast each morning was a highlight, featuring a great variety of options to suit all tastes, from local specialties to international favorites. The coffee was particularly excellent, a perfect start to the day!

The family and staff were also on hand with helpful tips about the local area and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable. Their recommendations for dining and activities were spot on. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect retreat. Highly recommend for anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and enjoy a slice of paradise!","We had an amazing stay at Mandaladesa and we hope to be back. We highly recommend this place - for couples or families. We came as a family of 3.
We were looking to unwind and recharge, and thatâ€™s what this place exactly did.  Away from the hustle and bustle - the view of the surrounding rice fields was beyond calming and rejuvenating.
The owner and staff are very kind, attentive and helpful. Very flexible with their service, healthy breakfast is served whenever you want and wherever you wish, by the garden, pool or at your villa.  They provide a list of suggestions of activities, places to eat and visit.  We truly appreciated this, as we came with no plan and this made our visit even more enjoyable. Very valuable tips from the locals! The very good massages in the evening, made a very good cap to the day.
The facilities and amenities are true to the photos and videos in their website.  The resort is well maintained, good quality furniture and super clean. We hope to visit again soon!","Booked the resort last minute, quaint, serene and country vibes with view of the paddy fields, Classy interiors, friendly staff, eco friendly resort run by a cordial German  family. They made sure that our stay was comfortable and pleasant and managed to arranged a relaxing spa and local dinner at short notice. It was a perfect end to our trip to Bali after experiencing the city and touristic vibes of Bali. The hearty soulful breakfast was the cherry on the cake.","Staff and owner were friendly and accommodating. They offer a wide variety of food choices. Definitely recommend to guests wanting to stay in a peaceful place.

Did not regret staying here as it looks and feels like Ubud, we experienced the nearby Luwak coffee and swing, and Sukawati Art Market.

They also offer laundry service for an extra fee so that you come home from your holiday without having to worry about your laundry.","Amazing resort, well maintained and very friendly staff. We had to go on sudden booking and they made very good arrangements in short notice. People who love nature will fall in love with this place."
