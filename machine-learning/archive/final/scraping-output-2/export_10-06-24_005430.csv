I like how crisp the fried pork was. So delicious. I bought a package one so included with drink. It just like a hidden gem. Because from the outside it wasnt look like a restaurant.,"Their pork belly and ribs are amazingly good and tender as well as their soup. If you ever wanted to visit this restaurant, bring your whole team along with you, so you can order their group package. I personally don't recommend it if you come here alone. Their scooter parking area is accommodating but if you come by car, you need to walk a little. Still worth it.","I ordered pork knuckle, iga bakar jumbo, urutan, and sayur gondo. Everything was exceptional. The pork ribs were amazing, literally melting. The pork knuckle was crispy and full of flavor. Shout out for the urutan, too.","The food is delicious. Very green and forest looking ambience. Fast service. The only small concern is you have to drive through a stretch of small narrow road to reach the restaurant. Parking is managed by the restaurants. The place is silent, cool and relaxing. Totally enjoy it. You must visit once and taste the food.",Foods were really nice! The pork ribs were so tender and juicy. The fried pork was crispy and tender. The Sambal can be spicier tho. But the Kangkung was very spicy already. Overall it was really good

The seafood was fresh. The portion is large. Price is cheap too! Highly recommend.,"everything we ordered were delicious!
