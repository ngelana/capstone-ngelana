I didn't expect too much because the price is underrated. I choose this hotel because it's very close to airport (about 10 minutes) and also near from Kuta Beach. But surprisingly this hotel was good enough, the room was clean and comfortable, the breakfast also good.","About our stay

Good hotel with a good location , close to everything. If you are in Kuta Beach you can take grab everywhere so dont be too difficicult about the location of this hotel since grab doesnt cost a lot. We switched between motorbike/ car.

Rooms are nice, spacious good airconditioning. Only thing we might missed was maybe a small Fridge but aside from that everything was perfect.

Service wise the hotel and staff are very friendly and helpful. During our stay we had even gained a room upgrade thanks to Ayu our receptinist. Thanks for your service and taken care while we stay stay here. Hope to see this hotel getting the attention it deserves.","Pool was nice but that was about it, there were leaking roofs in our room, no alcohol sold on the premises, call to prayer at the mosque next door at 4 am and military trumpet on the other side at 6 am. Avoid unless only stay a night or so.
Holiday for locals only I‚Äôd say","Horrible place. Avoid. Dirty, smelly, mosquito infested... long overdue for renovations.

Arrived in the late evening. Airport pickup 60 minutes late. At check-in the gave us a room key of room still occupied by people. Security??? Imagine the occupants surprise.

Room is dirty, smelly sheets, smelly towels, leakage everywhere, walls peeling of paint, bugs ants?.. no reaction from staff after down as phone does not work.

Breakfast is cold, mosquitos everywhere. Staff is touching the food with bare hands ( bread). Guests are allowed to smoke.

Rundown...avoid","I was booked for the meeting room . i already booked here twice .
The staff are very friendly and stand by during the event.  nice meeting room service, good location, and value for the money.
and for sure mrs Bella help us so much. She assist us well and quick responce if we need something.

thank you Mrs Bella and Quest Hotel :)"

My wife n myself Checked in for overnight stay.the hotel from the street and lobby and leading up to rooms all looked nice.we stayed in room 316.
Horrified would be one word.worst hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed at including indo aussie or Vietnam.
The aircon was filthy and wasn‚Äôt cold at all.fridge wasn‚Äôt cold the seals were hanging down,coffee cups were chipped and cracked.the bed was heavily stained.The shower bath had mould and goo all around the silicone seal.Even the door had the wood separating and there was a long gap.
The tv screen was scratched deeply on the top half of the screen.there was maybe 20 sheets of toilet paper.
With the aircon I pulled out the filters and they weren‚Äôt really full but the rest of it was just disgusting blowing all particles out on you.Took pics and asked told them aircon wasn‚Äôt cold sent 3 fellas up to fix it.we came back 2hrs later it was exactly the same.Neither of us sleeped at all that night it was so hot in there.
The free buffet breakfast was terrible,there were fly s all round the food and well it looked like it had run out with not much left of anything on offer anyway but it was only 0830.Didn‚Äôt n‚Äôt even have a spoon for sugar in coffee just a wooden spatula and the table was sticky so wiped down with wet ones it was brown. If this all wasn‚Äôt enough I ordered a omelette and I happily started eating it not really looking at it.My mrs seen that it wasnt cooked, was all slimy in the middle.
Stay clear of here","At the cheaper price, the room exceeded our expectations in this nice and cozy hotel. The pool with a bar was great, but I didn't have time to experience it.","I stayed for just one night before my flight. Despite the nice hotel photos, the reality was different. While it might have been great a decade ago, it's now an aging place. The bathrooms were in terrible condition, and the breakfast was unsuitable for European tastes. There was no coffee machine, just instant coffee, which was disappointing. The gym seemed untouched for about five years, with outdated equipment and no air conditioning. However, I must say that the staff was the highlight of the hotel. Their service was exceptional, and they truly deserve a five-star rating. For the price, a better hotel could have been found.",Great value hotel. Foods good pool area lovely staff are great üëç,Excellent. Nice and cozy hotel with a great surrounding area. Friendly staff member with Bali ecstatic design. You are simply blown away with their hotel design and decoration. Truly different from others. Parking space is quite limited but it works. The hotel room needs to be revamped a bit. Kinda out to date and need repair. Other than that it is an absolutely fantastic and sweet experience for me and my family. Go check it out.

- Heater is not working properly, we stayed for 4 days and for the first 2 days, we consistently had problems with the faucet as very very hot water is coming out and we had to report at the first floor to fix
-  The hotel in general, is not properly maintained.","For the price (12 euro room/night) to spend the night is OK. Ohthervise I think there are better places to stay in Kuta for the same price.

1. As someone wrote before, photos are from the good old times. The hotel is old, bathroom door is broken.

2. Bed sheets and towels are with stains. It was unpleasant to sleep because it wasn't only one or few stains, all the sheet looked dirty. Also swimming pool looked dirty, we didn't use it.

3. In the second day hot water disappeared.

4. We stayed at the silence day, so in the afternoon chichen, vegetables, everything except rice and noodles was sold out. I think it's a shame for the hotel to not prepare enough food for that kind of day when people can't go outside.

5. Superior rooms are in the first floor, they don't have window and place where to sit outside.","If your schedule full with day time activities, this is the best stay for sleep. Nearby airport and the local convenient store just in front of the hotel. Its located in the middle of a village. Easy to go to Kuta Steet and Discovery Mall. Using grab car only for RP 21,000. (Jan, 2024 price). If you rented a bike, there is a parking for you in first come basis. So far it is a accessible places.","Location is okay, in a side street little away from traffic noise.
The room has a wardrobe cabinet, the bed is ok.
Lighting is too dim. Only 2 downlihlghts and 2 beside table lights.
TV, but nothing is in English to work it out, it's from a usb dongle just for Netflix and Amazon prime.
The bathroom is quite large.
Hot water comes after a few minutes.
Overall it's clean.
Price is reasonable.
Staff not overly friendly.
My reasons to give a low rating are,
No windows in the ground floor rooms, door from the next room is next to the room side by side instead of opposite.
Makes it very loud when someone enters late and slams the door.
The main reason for the lower score is the very strong mouldy smell in the bedroom.
I had the try keeping the door open and the reception gave me a fragrant spray, but did not change anything at all.
I was glad to only stay for 1 night only.",".2
‚ÄúGood Value for Money!‚Äù
We stayed here for 3nights, the location is 10-15min drive to Kuta beach. The room and toilet as well as balcony is spacious enough. The staff are friendly and timely attends our needs. The room is neat, however there is a foul smell coming from the toilet. Hope the hotel management sorts it out. Overall, I recommend this hotel, would certainly comeback."

The restaurant charges 21% more than the prices listed in the menu, but they say it at the bottom of every page. The local food was very nice and served in good quantities, but the pizza was bad (thick hard dough that seemed like a hard crunchy toast topped with cheese and thick slices of tomato). They accept payment by card. There are some nearby supermarkets and it's within walking distance of the airport. If taking a Gojek/taxi, it may take some time until you leave the small streets around the hotel since they can't fit both a car and a scooter, so it will take longer that what you might expect.","I have stayed here a few times. It is inexpensive, the rooms are large and it is close to the airport. Airport hotels are generally somewhat depressing. The Diana Suites feels a little like a regular hotel and there are some good restaurants close by.","Less than bearable, the hotel is in very poor conditions. Specially the room and bathroom were disgusting, dirty, full of rusty and mould. The staff were friendly but that‚Äôs the only good point. it seems that the hotel was a good option a few years ago but nowadays is dilapidated. I think all good reviews are old or unreliables (fake reviews are a common practice in Bali). You don‚Äôt expect luxury in a budged hotel just a clean room, but unfortunately that wasn‚Äôt the case. It‚Äôs a completely joke that this hotel is advertised as a 4 stars one.",The room is bit weird that the bathroom can hear the other guest talking from upstairs room.

I really like their mango pudding (soft and fresh). The hospitality is very good. The important things are they could handle a large group very well,"Nothing to say really about the service except for it felt a bit strange timing wise and our duck firstly came to our table then disappeared and came back in rolls, although afterwards we ordered another half bbq duck and it was perfect. Honestly though I was surprised it was quiet for a place with so much atmosphere, definitely worth a visit.","Now this is a restaurant. Incredible vaulted bamboo pavilions, live seafood, amazing drinks and food. I had a bok choy, mango, passion fruit smoothie. Wonderful blend of flavors. Brilliant idea to sweeten it with passion fruit syrup. I had the vegetable spring rolls as an appetizer and braised chicken in black bean sauce as the main. Everything was excellent. This restaurant deserves a high rating, great food, excellent atmosphere, and innovative. A welcome treat after the 4.9 rated hole in the wall, with zero ambience, tons of road and run of the mill food that was recommended in Candidasa last night .",It was an amazing experience.

Great stay here. I will be back on my way to the airport for another few nights before I fly to another country. I would recommend staying here. it's a good spot to meet other travelers and a good starting point for visiting Bali.","Pros:
1. Fantastic staff. Friendly and polite. Speak fluent English.
2. Very very clean. This is the only hostel in Indonesia that I can walk barefoot in without my feet feeling sticky/dirty.
3. Location is close to airport (although it‚Äôs complicated to walk there, as you have to cross some highways and find ways around high fences).

Cons:
1. Some of the bunk beds creak a lot. It‚Äôs a real pain for sleep.
2. They give you one free small bottle of water. After that they charge you 5000 Rupiah to refill!","I just walked 15 minutes by foot from the airport to the hostel! It's very easy to reach.

This place seems to be a spot where the tour guide first takes tourists for lunch right after you get off the plane.

Don't be tricked. You will see many other tourists being brought here to have their lunch. The prices are on the high side for food that is mediocre at best. There is a separate menu for locals and tourists. Prices differ, of course.

Our fried chicken was literally dripping in oil. Disgusting but we were hungry and ate it anyway. No choice. It cost us like RM 60 for a meal for 2, not including drinks. Such a meal would have only cost about RM 25 at most back home.

There are many other options to eat out there. Don't make the mistake of dining here.","Simple restaurant that serves a variety of Indonesian style chicken and fish dishes.

The sauces and chilli for the chicken dishes was excellent but the chicken itself was too dry for me. This might be due to the way it was cooked, understand that they overcooked the chicken till the bones are soft and edible which was something different for me.

Service was good but the food does take awhile to be served eventhou the restaurant was about half filled.","The Nasi Ayam Tulang Lunak was decent, but I found the price to be on the higher side considering the taste. The chicken was tender, but overall, it didn‚Äôt quite meet my expectations. Perhaps they could improve the seasoning or adjust the pricing.","A tourist place for sure. Food was average. Except for the very soft bones that you could eat, nothing special about it. The fish is so bland that it has no taste whatsoever. Once was enough.","So I heard that if you're a foreigner they will give you the foreigner menu which is supposedly 2x more expensive than the ""lokal"" locals menu. Overall, only the tahu telur was not bad. Very standard taste. The fish wrapped in fried crispy egg was overly fishy and kind of spoiled the taste for me."

They did not produce their own pastries and primarily sourced them from Br**d, including the croissant variants. The matcha cinnamon roll was supplied by a different bakery. While the matcha flavor was not authentic and seemed to use essence, the almond croissant was flaky, crispy, and not overly sweet.

Surprisingly, the hot cappuccino was excellent, well-rounded, and balanced. The filtered coffee from Argopuro origin was also delightful, offering fruity flavor notes and low to medium acidity that intensified after a few minutes.","Lovely little coffee place in Tuban.

Worse customer service I received in Bali, so bad I complained via email.
Needs updated pictures of the rooms. Not what you expect from a ""hotel and spa"" at this price.
Also, far from a lot of places unless you have a scooter (although if you have a scooter, is anywhere far?)

*Broken AC, almost empty hotel but no one is willing to help you sort out problems in the room. There's so many better and cheaper places in the  area. I panicked and booked online when I should've opted for a homestay.
Trust me. Go somewhere else","The property is good with an old world charm
The location is a good 15 minutes walk from the beach and other tourist attractions
The rooms were just about okay - but the toilets were a disaster with water dripping on your head when you sit on the toilet pot, such a disappointment

The toiletries were basic - the towel was not upto the mark

The kettle in the room was not clean and the fridge was not stocked

The beds were comfortable
The aircons were noisy and took time to cool the room

There was no restaurants on the property and the room service options were very very limited - mostly sourced from nearby eateries","The ""Radiant"" Hotel and ""Spa"" might have been a nice place according to all the flashy pictures of Breakfast Buffets, Spa, Restaurant etc. but sadly non of it exists anymore or at least at the moment.

There is no SPA (closed).
There is no Restaurant (closed).
And there is no Breakfast Buffet or anything else of those pictures.
You see many damages in the hallways and rooms, the place is all in all not in great condition.

You get a standard breakfast (which was OK) in your   room - and you can eat it on the bed since there is nor even a desk that you can eat on properly.

The driver that we ordered at the reception the day before was 20 minutes late - better Calculate that in if you want to be at the airport on time.

On the positive side: The beds are comfy and the pool was in working order when I was here.

As a cheap Bed & Breakfast near the airport it is ok, but luring people in with all those old pictures is dishonest in my opinion. Especially when they still advertise having those things in the booking platforms and showing pictures that do not at all resemble what you get.","Amazing stay, very close to airport, convenient, nice staff, beautiful hotel, nice pools.","Yet another lesson to not get influenced by the pics posted online. The Radiant hotel rooms are nothing like in the pictures. I booked a standard room as we were staying only a couple of nights but got a sub- standard deal. The first room we were shown was smelling musty and had seepage stains on the walls and the entire room was lit by one dim light in the center.  The room we eventually took was only a shade better. The paint on the walls had faded, the bedsheets looked old and had several stains. The furniture was old and chipped and the wardrobes were in a dark corner. The room and the bathroom hadn't been cleaned well and weren't cleaned well for  the duration of our stay.
For the amount of attention they pay towards the outer appearance of the hotel, a little more attention towards the rooms would be nice and is warranted.
But even after repeated complaints about the bed linen that i have come across on portals and having encountered it in person, i am curious as to why the management isn't doing anything about it.
Special mention to the restaurant staff for being so sweet and attentive. One tiny redeeming factor of our stay."

Upon arrival, the room smells damp and old. Water leaking from the ceiling dripping to the toilet bowl in the toilet. The cupboard and table are dusty. There's no wall power plug point anywhere near the bed. There's one weird door near the toilet that is locked. The decor is very old and also creepy. If you are a person that's sensitive to the third entity, i suggest you not to stay there. Not long after we checked in, we felt an uncomfortable presence coming from the locked door and there was a blood smell coming out of nowhere. We checked out within an hour of arriving.","Clean, TV, AC, hot/cold water, staff friendly and Hotel Manager very good man and speak English. 1 thing i can complain about is poor WiFi. Only work outdoor.
Non smoking rooms, but right outside room-door is small table with ashtray and chairs. And judge by this Standard, very affordable (i would say Cheap. Esp. if rent pr month. I recommend this Hotel if looking for longer stays, or if stay for short time if arrive late, because only 5minutes from Airport. Also Hotel provide car if necessary. And many local small ""warung"" (places to buy local cuisine) and small shops were you can buy coffee, cold drinks, cigarettes etc!
Manager help with transport and/or any advice needed... And NO stress with payment, although normal courtesy and local custom is to pay at once.
I found Puri Bunga Inn to be a pleasant surprise... And Recommend Puri Bunga Inn if not looking for luxury and expensive Hotels...",We loved the Puri bunga inn. Made and family did so much to make our stay enjoyable. It's tucked away in a quiet friendly neighbourhood near the airport. A very nice family run accommodation choice.

Prices are so cheap and the quality good.","Location is very strategic but lack of parking lot. It's very early traditional morning market. With lots of local varian daily needs and breakfast also. Normal local prices, even in the store. Love this market and worth to visit.","Traditional market in Kuta. Went there a few times in the early morning to get fresh fruits. Got mangosteen, mangoes, Salat (snake fruits), guava, passionfruit (not as good as Australian ones), coconut, cooked corn, cooked potatoes, jackfruit and a few others. Cost is a bit high for tourists and bargaining can be tough, especially if there are other tourists nearby. However, go early enough (before the other tourists) and you can still bargain for reasonable prices. Is was a good experience of you're short on time. Otherwise try bigger traditional markets further away such as the one in Ubud.",24 hour market opened only when sellers are there. Arrived at 7pm and market was closing..... better to visit in day time.,Each stall has their own fresh options of vegetables and meat and eggs.

AC worked well.
I walked to the airport. 10-15 minutes.
Not exactly a ""bed and breakfast"" but it's a good place to stay a few days.","Despite all the bad reviews here, i can say that i'm happy i stayed here. The staff was super friendly and tried to help in every situation. The rooms had fresh beds and towels. There was TV and AC available. My flight home was very late and i checked out at 12am, so i asked if my baggage could stay at the B&B. They looked for my stuff and i was allowed to shower in a free room before going to the airport. In conclusion: Yes there is a Mosque nearby, but that is no expception on Bali or Lombok. So you have to get used to it. The place isn't luxury hotel, but very very close to the airport and good to reach by foot/ grab.

Would visit again.","I arrived at 2am in Bali and had no where to stay, so I messaged this Christinas son on WhatsApp (number displayed on google maps) and within 10 minutes I had a room.

It isn‚Äôt the cleanest and fanciest place, but it‚Äôs close to the airport and if you are looking for one night I definitely recommend. Hospitality of the Family was great.","it was a miserable experience. thank god our friends had a room too bc our bathroom had no light and was disgusting overall. and we couldn‚Äôt even close the door bc it wouldn‚Äôt move. the room smelled and it was from the ac so we had to shut it down, the bedding was stained‚Ä¶ never have i ever rented worse accommodation during my years of traveling. one star is honestly generous","This is just a place for emergency, its not so comfortable the bathroom stinks there were mosquitos but you get what you pay"

We came back multiple times for a great breakfast. Keep in mind, the combo is great! (Could be a temporary offer)","Nice place for breakfast & coffee, and some good pastries and cakes to takeaway (lemon meringue so good!)

They accept card, but with minimum 100k spend, so buy everything together if you have no cash - this also carries over into the main Pepito supermarket area.

We learnt this the hard way so that you don‚Äôt have to!","My wife and I love this place, we had our first visit today. Firstly, the bakery itself is stunning and has a large selection of cakes, breads and pastry items on display which look scrumptious; they almost look fake they're that perfect. I had a latte and a large pretzel and they were both great quality. My wife had a watermelon fruit juice and a pretzel and was very happy with them both. The staff were great to deal with and had great smiles; they even indulged my, probably annoying, request for 100 rupiah coins in my change which I asked for as a token to give to my friend who collects coins. Overall a very enjoyable experience and I'll be going back for breakfast tomorrow. Most importantly, the prices are fantastic!"

I am from India and I enjoyed here a lot. They provide free drinking water all time. The bathrooms are clean and we get hot water to bath everytime. The rooms are so cheap and it will be beyond our expectations. According to Indian currency, the price for per day is 350 rupees.","The only good thing about this place is the distance to the beach, other than that I would advise people NOT to stay in this establishment.

For one, the building and the inside looks like someone hasn‚Äôt been cleaning the place for way too long.

Second, the receptionist was asleep when I arrived and looked so unprepared.

Third, and it is the most mind boggling for me is that they only turn the AC at 6 pm so you will be checked in into a hot room and it has this weird smell.

Fourth, the bathroom was the worst, I mean okay you are a budget hostel but at least do some cleaning. The bathroom was dirty, no shampoo or soap provided, at one of the bathroom looks like someone threw up beside the toilet.

Fifth, we weren‚Äôt able to close the door in our room, so even if they turn on the AC, its not cold enough because the air went outside with the open door üôÇ

Overall BAD! üëéüèº","I would say one thing: NEVER AGAIN even I am a solo traveler. When cockroach crossed my bed for the first time in Bali I knew that they will never see me again at this place.
