The houses are surrounded by a well-groomed garden, and the swimming pool is big and clean! The place is really tranquil, the staff is extremely helpful, polite and friendly‚ù§Ô∏è","I lived here for about a month, great place!  value for money and the best quality!  excellent staff, for 3 months of housing in Bali, I managed to change many places and I have never met a better hostess!  loved feeding her two beautiful kittens, every morning!",Nice place to stay in local area. Close to the beaches/Canggu and at the same time close to the mountains and Northern Bali. Very convenient if you want to visit both. Room cleaned every week. I loved the bed and bedsheets !!! So fresh and comfy !!!  Very kind owner and stuff. Great  pool. Stayed for a month.,"I came here about four month ago, I spent two months in Gladak house 2 and about two months and still in Coucou apartment 1 ( I am talking about both because it's the same guest house but they have 2 different type of houses)

Gladak House is a traditional bali wooden house with a private small kitchen and a private bathroom.

Coucou apartment is a small modern apartment (around 40 meter) with a small reception and a small open kitchen and a private bathroom.

Our experience so far is very good, the room is very clean and they used to clean it once a week now they do clean it twice! Which is very good.

The bathroom is clean.
The small kitchen and the fridge are very useful, we cook everyday.
The AC is working fine and they clean it regularly.
The Swimming pool is clean and very enjoyable specially in sunny days.

The staff is very friendly and very helpful and they help you with whatever you need.
The owner is very friendly and very helpful, and always available if you need anything."

I have met the nicest and most welcoming people during my stay - especially Jes, Hanna, Budi and Gita. Among other things, Jes helped me arrange a motorbike to use during my stay and Hanna helped me arrange my trip to Nusa Lembongan, Budi made sure I had the best coffee in Bali every morning and all of them gave me great tips on what to see and do in the area.
I‚Äôve had the luck to join their FamJam Bali session twice during my stay.
If you‚Äôre looking for a place with great wifi, a laid back and chilled vibe, play music, meet locals and a great location near all highlights, then join the Oxy family!
Thank you guys for everything and I hope to see you again soon‚ù§Ô∏è","Comunity Garden , rent a tent, get Happy without much tourists , 30min from Touristik Center changgu, awesome sunrise over ricefilds, got a nice Caf√© inside with Coffee Made from hole beans , macha Tee also available, Kids friendly space . Woundefull setting to do Yoga on your own ( so far No teacher available )
Prises are absulutly fair . Jam Sessions mostly every Weekend, with Open Mic .",This is definitely an amazing place for digital nomads. I spent the entire February working here and it really feels like home. Jasper and his family were super nice and always willing to help. They have steady and fast WiFi there and serve free coffee. And beyond working there you also got to meet the local community. The OpenMic that Jas holds every two weeks at Oxy is a perfect chance for anyone who‚Äôs new to Bali to meet the local musicians and artists. Will definitely come back again!,"I lived in Oxycoworking for 2 months. It was one of the best experiences that happened to me during my trip to Asia. It's a place away from the tourist zone where you can experience the real Bali. If you want, you can reach Canggu in just 15 minutes by motorbike and have everything at your fingertips.

On the other hand, I have to mention how lucky I was to meet Jess and Hanna, who are the owners. They became like a family to me, and I felt welcomed from the very first day. In my free time, when I wasn't working on my computer, I had many conversations and laughs with them.

The coworking space is incredible. It has a super relaxed and focused atmosphere. It's surrounded by nature with lots of green areas and a huge rice field with palm trees in the background. Additionally, recently Budi and Gita opened a slow and manual coffee shop. It's a delightful addition.

Sleeping in the tent for 2 months was a pleasant surprise. I'm 6 feet tall, and I could stand inside the tent. The bed was spacious, measuring 5 feet wide, and very comfortable. I had enough space to put all my belongings, and there were even more storage options outside if I needed them.

It was a shame to leave that incredible place, but my journey had to continue. However, I will definitely return ‚ù§","A humble coworking space and a city camping site! They have Calma Coffee too, a slow coffee that you would enjoy every step of the process. Hidden gem in Abianbase area."

Definitely will come back here everytime i visit BALI!!","Beautiful place with trees, a roof terrace and awesome pool area looks just like the pictures! The room was clean, came with soaps and toothbrush and the bed was soft comfortable. Only bad point is not a great location with nothing around in walking distance and it's  around 20 min drive to the beach and main shops. Great for a couple of nights stay.

The atmosphere inside this coffee shop was very vibrant and relaxing. The barista was so friendly and pleasant to talk with. One thing that I got fascinated by this place.

Picture this: you're sipping your coffee, surrounded by rice fields, and soaking in the slow and mesmerizing coffee-making process. Oh, and they sometimes surprise you with traditional snacks like lak-lak. Best part? It won't break the bank! Plus, it's smack dab in a coworking space with killer Wi-Fi, so you can actually get stuff done. The big garden and chill vibes? Seriously, it's like stepping into your personal Zen zone. Calma Coffee is my go-to spot for finding inner peace in the middle of the city chaos. Trust me, you need this in your life!","Great hidden cafe.. loved the oak milk cappuccino. From the outside it kinda looks rough and dead but once you're in its coziness, creativity and personal attention that welcomes you. Budi and gita great hosts. Will be back guys x"
