It has a lot of packages with delicious dishes such as Sate Lilit, fish balls, fish soup. You can also choose to sit in one of their gazebos. Next time you passed Jl. Prof. Ida Bagus Mantra, give it a try!","There is many good reviews but I'm not sure why. Food was tastless especially the grilled fish, it waan't fresh and was supposed to be jumbo size but it was very small. Veges and sate sticks was cold I think from the fridge and not fresshly cooked. As for the ice tea all tasted artificial.
Not recommended.","We live nearby and we love what they do with fish and Balinese traditional dish. They also have fresh coconut for $1. It‚Äôs really good and won‚Äôt break your bank to eat lunch or dinner üòÅ Also really close to Tegenungan waterfall, Saba beach, & Bali Safari.",Is goods,Really bad. The food had no Taste.

Came here for brekkie and back again for dinner, left feeling happy each time.
Service was good, and the back dining area is gorgeous with rice field view and beautiful lightingüòç
The babur ayam was our favourite dish with great flavours!
We‚Äôll be back when in the area.","Developing into a great resto. A new and very nice garden joglo has just been built with rice and coconut tree views. Pleasant atmosphere and positioned just off the bypass plus opposite the hospital make it a great spot.
Menu is varied and quality matches price but at a middle level, not fancy.
Garden is very good just to stop off for a cold drink and rest a while.","We ordered take-aways, a grilled chicken and a spaghetti bolognese. The grilled chicken was okay, but I only managed to have one small bite of the spaghetti. It was way over-cooked and too sweet ( like sugar sweet) Tasted something like they put a bottle of cheap instant tomato sauce into it.

Anyway, I should have gone for just the indonesian food. Avoid the western foodü•≤","The food was okay. Bit expensive compared to other local restaurants in Bali. Mostly targeting tourists.  If you are going with a guide, their commissions will be indirectly added to customers. Taste was not bad. The ambiance was good. But it depends on the seat availability.","The first times we went there the food was good, but the last 2 times we ate there it was so bad, they not even know how to make Nasi Goreng with fried egg, we waited 25 Minutes and than was cold, no fried egg. Since the big lady in the kitchen cook the food quality so bad. Last time had Spaghetti Bolognese used to be so good, now make with hot sauce. Sorry never again eat at this place again, better order across at the restaurant at the hospital, great food.
How can a place from good change to so bad."
