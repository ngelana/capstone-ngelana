Didn’t learn a lot about this place but it has a army vehicle/weapon so guessing it’s something to do with that. Very clean but old place. Not a lot of visitors when we went there.","Old dilapidated monument, with weaponry show that did not relate with what the event was (Russian made 1960-ish gun at the monument that commemorate 1946 independence war). However as Indonesian, it is good to pay respect to the unsung hero that departed before us in defending the sovereignty (80+ departed from the 240+ men) and understanding the meaning of freedom and independence.

It not an attractive tourism spot though, and all the information is in Bahasa Indonesia only.",There is not much to see. You are asked to give a donation which are usually between 100.000 and 250.000 which is way too much for what you get to see.,Beautiful but sadly no explanation about this monument

Because we met scams by bus in Gilimanuk and it was so horrible.

Why I wrote this? Do something with it!",The campground doesn't really exists anymore! There are no facilities and if you like to stay anyway you have to pay the National Park fee of 200.000IDR/person (on weekends the double price)!!! The location itself it's between the very busy and noisy road no.1 and the not very nice beach. So no way to stay there any more!,"Very nice place, silent and a step into the beach","A not-so-bad camping place. But it got some unmaintained building (which i guess usually used for meet-up place) and it makes this place looked ugly and creepy at night. It also got access to a beach, which is also unmaintained very well, it's always dirty.."
