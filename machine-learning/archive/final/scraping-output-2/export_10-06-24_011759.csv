Some recent reviews warned of bed bugs, but there was 3 of us and we had no issues at all over 3 nights. The rooms are nice and comfortable, however shower and toilet are the same room.

Common area is beautiful, has a pool and conducive to socializing/meeting new people. I found the male staff more friendly/easy going while the one younger lady was a bit intimidating and not as friendly.

Location is FAR out from almost everything in Uluwatu (20min scooter ride). The Warung right next door is awesome!","Pretty nice hostel. 5 minute ride to the beach, 25 minutes to the Uluwatu Temple. Quiet location, warm pool and free dinner. Ping pong table and pool table making solo travel socialising a breeze üëå worth stopping in","Stayed a week here, honestly great hostel. Staff were very helpful and kind super outgoing and organise free dinner everynight which is vegetarian. The hostel itself is far out from everywhere so will need a scooter to get around. The beds are clean and made again every morning. Would recommend for solo travelers to make friends.","Do not stay here! There‚Äôs constant bed bugs which the owner and staff try to keep secret! I only found out there were some in the room when someone from my room told me. I came back and all my clothing on my bed was gone; you‚Äôd think they done the nice thing and cleaned them, nope they said there were no clothes on the bed meaning my north face shorts and tops grew legs and walked off by them self. I spoke to the manager about this and he said I should have used the locker, but they didn‚Äôt provide a key and how can u fit a 70L back pack into a small locker. I would recommend sleeping on the streets before this hostel.","actually a very nice hostel with great opportunities to connect, especially at the free dinner.
the staff was very friendly & helpful.
the rooms were okay, not so clean & the bathroom smelled really badly. lockers were tiny and did not do their job.
unfortunately we found out we had bedbugs during our third night there. we were shocked to find out that it was a known problem, since we heard it from other rooms & the staff was aware as well.
when we looked at our pillows closely, it was obvious that there were bedbugs living inside and was just hidden with a pillowcase.
we consider it very irresponsible by the staff to still give us this room."

Welldone to DRUWA BALI for having this kind of super nice accomodation. Im sure will be back again for my next visit in Uluwatu.","The place is beautiful!

The welcoming and helpful staff, as well as the really friendly owner made the stay here unforgettable. The tropical feeling bathrooms with jungle plants and the quiet pool area with huge pool were definitely Highlights of our stay. The pricing is also reasonable and well worth it in our opinion.
The Wifi was a bit slow overall and quite unreliable at times, which is the only area that could be improved in our opinion.

Overall we had an amazing stay and even came back for a second time just weeks later. And hopefully, it won‚Äôt be our last!","The Jiwana Bali Resort is a dream come true!

Unfortunately, just before my departure, I was robbed one evening. My door had been left unlocked, and the thieves managed to take my MacBook, clothes, and other items totaling a value of 60 million. Surprisingly, they avoided all the cameras.

When I requested the camera records to aid our investigation, the owner provided a flash drive containing only a single video from a different day, not relevant to the incident. Subsequent requests for the correct footage were met with prolonged delays in response, and ultimately, he did not save any of the pertinent videos.

Despite this, the owner initially offered a 10 million compensation, which I appreciated as a considerate gesture. However, he stipulated that if I involved the police, the offer would be void. Wanting to avoid disturbing the other residents, I agreed to handle it internally with an informal investigation among us.

Regrettably, two days later, the owner rescinded the compensation offer, leaving me to deal with the loss on my own. This has not only left me without recourse but also deeply disappointed in how the situation was handled.",Beautiful place for long term stays and for families.... Very kind hearted people.
