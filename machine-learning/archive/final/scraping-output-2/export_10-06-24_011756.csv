This charming property is one of over 30+ Edenia Private Villas in Ungasan, Kuta Selatan, Bali.

Almost all the best beaches on the island of Bali will be found in the Bukit Peninsula of Kuta Selatan, south of Ngurah Rai International Airport.

Villa Didi is perfectly located for surfers & beach lovers.

Impressive white sand beaches such as Balangan, Karma, Padang-Padang, Bingin, Melasti, Green Bowl, Pandawa and Geger are just a short thrilling drive away from the villa.

Driving around the Bukit Peninsula is such a joy. We loved the slow relaxing drives along narrow undulating & meandering roads immensely!

The landscape here is stunning and dramatically cinematic!!!

For a sensational sunset treat, experience the hypnotic Kecak Dance at Uluwatu Temple one evening and spend another evening chilling out at Single Fin, Uluwatu's (actually Bali's) hippest cliff-top bar & restaurant.

Kuta beach is about 60 to 90 minutes away, depending on traffic. If you plan on going there, park your vehicle at Beachwalk, Bali's best shopping center.

There are a couple of Carrefour outlets on the island: their transmart hypermarket at Sunset Road is the largest most well-stocked one-stop supermarket on the island.

While at Villa Didi, be sure to use 2 different phones with 2 different SIM cards - one from Indosat (better option) and another from Telkomsel (backup option) - if you need to be online for mission critical work ... so that when connectivity fails with one telecommunications company, you have a different service provider as backup to connect with.

As to be expected, cellular reception at this particular geographically remote location is generally spotty; connectivity at the villa is best in the room on the highest floor.

Besides driving to Tanah Lot and checking out Legian & Seminyak along the way, we highly recommend a leisurely day trip to Kintamani: visit the amazing Monkey Forest in Ubud along the way; stop for lunch at the pretty Tegallalang rice terraces; and spend the afternoon soaking up one of Bali's best hot spring resorts - Toya Devasya - by the picturesque lake in the crater of an active volcano.

Have a FABULOUS TIME in beautiful Bali!!!

P.S. Didi (villa owner) is extremely responsive & hospitable and his staff - Yek (property manager), Ketut (gardener) & Komang (maid) - will be very happy to welcome you!","Good place with family, enjoy, relax but wifi not working...",Very clean and good location,Amazing villas compound with a traditional touch,Nice area with1gate system

The room is very spacious and clean, with big bathroom and beautiful balcony. You may have to walk a bit to get to the beach or any other place but it‚Äôs an amazing position if you want to go to the south beach clubs in Bukit or to Nusa Dua beach or Malasti. The staff was very friendly and they also had an amazing and loving doggo!","I recently stayed here with my bf and unfortunately, the overall experience didnt meet expectations. Despite being a reputed hotel, the service was subpar from the moment of arrival. The staff were unfriendly, and the overall management of the hotel left much to be desired. One significant issue was the malfunctioning water heater, which remained unrepaired from the first day of our stay to the last.

furthermore, the hotel facilities appeared to lack safety measures. a particularly disappointing incident involved the disposal of my face masks. I placed them in our sharing refrigerator, only for them to be discarded without any explanation. this was especially frustrating as I had just purchased the masks (50 sheets), lol it‚Äôs all not about the price, just wondering ‚Äúwhy they did no excuses?‚Äù. such incidents reflect poorly on the hotel's management and customer service.

I strongly urge the hotel to address these issues promptly, as they significantly impact the overall guest experience. Improvements in management and a more attentive approach to customer service are needed for a more positive stay for future guests.

thanks üòä","I loved my stay in Adila Bali! My room was very spacious, it had a beautiful sea view and a large balcony where you can see both sunrise and a sunset. I also enjoyed the yoga classes and Balinese massages. Amazing restaurant with a lot of vegetarian options, a delicious big breakfast was included in my stay. The location is ideal for people who want to rest and relax. It was easy to rent a scooter and explore both local and touristic areas. Also Adila team is the best, they took amazing care of all my needs and requests. I will be coming back for sure!","This hotel is a perfect retreat. It offers a simple and cozy atmosphere, and we loved the interior design and the welcoming staff. The location was convenient for our needs. The only minor downsides were the lack of a minibar in the room and the occasional presence of geckos. If you're not too concerned about these issues, it's an excellent choice for a relaxing stay.","Amazing, so quite and peaceful, very very spacious rooms, really clean and tidy, ocean view, sea breeze, safe and secure, Coco the villa dog is so sweet, shes clean, vaxed and doesn't hang around when eating, she just wants love and sleeps. üòÄ.

Amazing coffee, loved my breakfast choice. And the waitresses were so friendly and polite! I‚Äôll definitely come back here.","The food and coffee is very good!

Food:

We got the rice bowls (tuna poke bowl & vegan bowl) and the portion is very big - good value for money! Vegetables are fresh and good variety.
The sauce of the vegan bowl is not that good - the one of the tuna bowl was way better. I would suggest to ask for a different sauce for the vegan bowl.

Coffee:

I got an americano and my bf a cappuccino. I  would have gotten a cappuccino with oat-milk but 20k for oat-milk is very overpriced for the average 10k at other spots. Besides that, good coffee and especially the mugs are very cute!

Atmosphere:

When we arrived we were quite surprised about the size of the restaurant. Sitting outside is way to loud and inside its just very small and you cannot have a private conversation. It can feel a bit awkward bc of that. However, the music they play is very nice and not too loud which is very nice.

Summery

Would come back for the tuna poke, the vegan bowl wasn‚Äôt as good bc of the sauce. I didn‚Äôt like the size of the spot and I wished the oat-milk would be cheaper. The bowls and mugs are very cute which I really liked. Was good for once!ü´∂"
