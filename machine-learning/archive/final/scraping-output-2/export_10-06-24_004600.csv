It is not deep, there is no sign saying don't jump! Be very careful.  I lost both my health and 20 million rupiah. I hope they put up a warning sign.","I like that this place has a gym, a pool, a sauna, and a cold bath all in one.

The gym is compact, but the equipment is new, everything is clean and well-maintained, and there's air conditioning. I also enjoy going to the sauna after the workout. I recommend this place for a visit.","A great huge place to get yourself fit with large swimming pool, gym, sauna and plunge pool.

The menu are very extensive so we opted for the basics and seems to be the favourite.

Good place to hang out and work out if you‚Äôre in Ubud.","I went to Titi Batu a few times during my short stay in Bali. I attended the 9am classes with Bamb≈©, which I really enjoyed. I was recovering from a running injury and Bamb≈© was very good at adjusting the exercises for me. The classes were diverse in regards to age and body types.
The facilities are really nice too. I had a smoothie bowl and a coconut water after each class, a real treat.
And of course not forgetting the Balinese staff, very sweet, helpful and patient.","I attended Toto Batu Ubud Club and I as greeted by some excellent customer service explaining the facility and what was included.  At what I feel was a very good price 300k (single entry pass), complete with a 75k food and beverage voucher I entered the venue.
My experience saw me utilise
- gym - very good gym for its size, good selection of free weights and machines, given it isn‚Äôt a hectic gym there was little issue utilising all equipment required.
- sauna - sitting at 84-86 degrees this took my breath away a little.
- steam room - similarly very hot but very effective
- swimming pools
- Lounge chairs
- restaurant- I had both a Hawaiian pizza and green curry, both were extremely well priced and the quality of food was amazing.

Overall I would happily recommend and would consider a membership if I lived in Ubud.

Ps, pool towel provided on arrival was 1st class and just showed the quality of the venue."

The staff were all super friendly and accommodating. Our room was very spacious and well designed. The resort grounds were very peaceful and well designed as well! The breakfast was absolutely fantastic and the spa was superb.  While the resort is outside of the main center of Ubud they do offer a complimentary shuttle, however, the shuttle times weren't always ideal. There were many additional complimentary amenities as a result of staying there. I highly recommend staying here and I will stay again if I have the opportunity!","A wonderful experience at Sankara Resort. Truly a 5 star experience.

I felt the staff were all so kind, caring and open to all and anything they could do to make the stay better in any way (fresh towels, premium glass bottled water.). They even offered to fill a bubble bath for me !

A special thank you and recommendation to the senior waitress Meri and the massage therapist Juli for their excellent service and for trying to make the stay extra special.

The front desk was very attentive (available 24 hours per day) and was always open to helping in any way.

Benefits
- Stunning room with a beautiful huge bed and jungle views.
- Beautiful infinity pool overlooking Ubud.
- Lovely morning breakfast (a la carte ordering - one set per day) with range of western and Indonesian menu options.
- Wonderful staff.
- Shuttle to main Ubud (Included) appx every hour. This goes to Coco Supermarket from the resort.
- Fresh bottled water and fruit in room daily ( loved the snakefruit !) (Included).
- Daily afternoon tea included with a range of Balinese treats. Recommend trying the herbal tea (fresh lemongrass and ginger.) (Included).
- Welcome foot massage in spa (Included).

Recommendations for resort
- The wifi is really good when working but was frequently slow or not working ( the front desk always restarted wifi within a short while when it was not working). System needs upgrade.
- More frequent shuttle times in the evening.
- Recommend updating Google maps / grab etc with accurate address. There is two Sankaras ( suites and resort) and it was confusing for drivers.
- Live music in restaurant was sometimes a little loud (perhaps could finish before 08:30pm).","We stayed in the Sankara resort for x5 nights on our honeymoon.
The hotel itself is very small and it is located in the middle of nowhere, however the hotel does provide a shuttle taxi into the town and back to the hotel at various times throughout the day/evening which we found brilliant!
Overall we really enjoyed our stay - but be aware that there will be lizards, mosquitoes and ants in your room as the bathroom area is open to the outdoors and there is no door to close it at night time.","My husband and I spent a week here on our honeymoon and it was amazing! The entire experience was wonderful. The resort was clean, safe, in a great location with a quick ride to Ubud. English speaking staff made the trip enjoyable for our first time to Bali. They were also able to accommodate a vegan diet!","We stayed with our kids in the private villa and the service is exceptional. I didn‚Äôt find such friendly service even in 5 star hotels. The restaurant servers delicious foods.
The only issue I had on my stay was the a/c on my villa. It leaked water and made terrible noise whole night but as soon as I informed the staff the problem was solved straightaway.
I loved the private pool."

The only thing I didn't like was the bathroom, it was old and not so clean, the towels were not cleaned properly. In summery, I would recommend this accommodation, it is a really good value for money.","The only disadvantage is the location. It is situated around 3.5 km from the Ubud market so you have to use the grab. Food options are also very limited. They provide options to eliminate the non-vegetarian items to make your food vegetarian, nothing specific for people with vegetarian preference. Resort staff are very humble and they try to provide the best service all the time. Rooms are excellent.","The staff was above exceptional. The hotel was beautiful, surrounded by nature. Food in the restaurant great, I would get the breakfast package again. The rooms were spacious and very nice.

I requested a refund in the morning, but the hotel declined, and I accepted their decision. However, as I was leaving, they asked to check the room, which added stress to my already tight schedule. Later, they accused me of taking the insect spray from the room and asked me to check my bags and return it. I found this behaviour disgraceful, especially considering that I had paid $140 for only six hours of stay. They blamed me for stealing their $1 mosquito spray, which was absurd. this hotel lacks basic hospitality and customer service.

There isn't much to do around the hotel, and it's quiet as it's away from the Ubud centre. Also noticed that I don't think no one was staying at this place which makes sense. The stuff barely speak English and communication is hard but when they ask for lost mosquito spray they speak English :)",Amazing hotel with lovely staff. Very service oriented and friendly. Will definitely come back here. The bed was a little bit dated and the sound isolation in between the rooms are poor. However everything else was good!,"The overall experience at the resort was disappointing. The staff lacked proactive service, often requiring guests to request even basic amenities. Limited vegetarian options, coupled with indifferent attitudes, made meals a challenge. Assistance for guests with luggage or children was not offered spontaneously, and even simple tasks like filling a water bottle were self-service. Cleanliness standards for items like kettles and spoons were subpar. The inconsistency between promises, like the in-room dinner menu, and the actual service further detracted from the overall stay. Not recommended at all.  Only people on reception are nice and atleast smiling.","Our stay at the hotel was okay. It's conveniently located, and the staff was really welcoming and helpful, which was a definite plus. The rooms were generally clean, but unfortunately, we did notice some cleanliness issues in the bathroom. There was mold around the sink, and the toilet seat wasn't as clean as we'd have liked. These bathroom concerns were a drawback to an otherwise decent stay.","Rooms and front desk staff were good. Only WiFi was spotty and kept on disconnecting.

Restaurant was the bad part during my stay. Staff in restaurant were very moody. One day they were good and second day they just ignore what you asked for. I asked for milk for my kids one day and the response was like as if I have asked for gold lol. No kidding, it was so bad that I just got the milk from market and start feeding my kids with that."

Staff are fantastic always willing to help and super friendly. thank you for having us ‚ù§Ô∏è",I would recommend to stay away from this place until the refurb is complete. When you arrive at hotel just before lobby the part of the car park is used as storage for building materials. Hotel itself is bit dated but with nice surroundings. We had a villa with private pool which could do with some work around as outdoor furniture was dirty. Room had some visible damage which was just covered with white paint which isn't ideal. The worst part was that hotel didn't have decency to advise guests before arriving to inform them about ongoing work. You get to be woken up just before 8am and then the nightmare starts. Constant banging and cutting of building materials which goes on till late at night. If we were informed about this before arrival we could have made alternative arrangements. Or instead of paying triple price  for the private villa could just stay in main hotel. When talking to the reception they just said yes we are doing expansion work and sorry. No compensation was offered this is just not right you don't hide facts like this from your guest its not acceptable. From what was supposed to be nice relaxing holidays where you can enjoy your own pool with nice view instead you have building site noise all day long and workers walking right by your pool. If you are booked for this hotel check with them and hopefully they will be honest and they will advise you that the building site is still ongoing so that you can book something else where you will be able to enjoy peace and tranquillity.

The room's attractive design made for an incredibly immersive experience. Not only were the villa's surroundings lovely, but they were also more accessible for getting to Ubud Central. The room had the ideal mix of comfort and style, and the included breakfast was delicious. The superb hospitality, on the other hand, was the highlight; every aspect was handled with the greatest of attention, making my stay absolutely unforgettable.","Beautiful villas in a nice area not too far from Ubud centre.
The staff were all very accommodating  during our stay ...Dea and the whole team went out of their way and could not do enough to ensure our stay was wonderful.

We stopped here for dinner. However, had we know about this amazing place, we would have come for a full day. They have swimming pool, sauna, steam, gym, Dj and lovely food.
Very modern place.
Lots of vegan options. Very very tasty! A star! 10 out of 10!","Perfect place to spend the day- gym, food, pool, coworking, what more could you want?

The salmon teriyaki with mashed potato was the favourite meal of my whole Bali trip!

Definitely worth it.","This place is a jewel and I was so happy to find it located next to my hotel (Kutus Kutus, a lovely boutique hotel a couple doors away).  I was able to buy a day pass for a very small fee and used the gym and pool facilities. The gym is sufficient in size with all the essential equipment needed.  I was VERY pleased to find a set of competition kettlebells from 8kg to 24kg - which I put to use!  You are provided a full size towel and hand towel with your day pass along with credit toward food and beverages at their restaurant.  The food is delicious!  I took breakfast there and had a yogurt bowl with fruit and granola, so delicious.  They have lots of fresh juice tea and coffee options also.  I also had lunch and dinner at their restaurant.  I only eat a select few fish (I do not eat pork, red meat or poultry ever) and I was able to find a lot of food options for myself.  For dinner I had the whole snapper, served with saut√©ed garlic spinach and mash potatoes (delicious).  For lunch I had their prawnless (vegan shrimp) sliders and potato wedges, so good! My experience in Ubud was so delightful thanks to access to Titi Batu and my lovely hotel Kutus Kutus nearby!",The place is good for pool and hangout. Would not recommend the place for dinner.  It took more than 30 mins to serve our dishes and nothing tasted good. We were 6 people and a toddler dining.,"The place is beautiful and relaxing, there are so many sport activities you can join, including swimming pool. On the entrance, they put sign ""no entry without a face mask"", but opposite with the actual.  I saw almost all guests not wearing mask but this restaurant allow them. I bought daily pass for gym, the gym is indoor, closed area, but all of guests not wearing mask.  The meals quite pricey. These are the reasons i put 3 stars."

The staff is very friendly, welcoming and accommodating.  You can go with a la carte or a set menu.  We decided to pick a 5 course set menu, and we enjoyed every dish that was served.  This restaurant offers cocktail pairing with it, but we thought this would be too much alcohol.  A couple at the next table selected cocktail pairing, and sounded like they enjoyed it a lot.  The few cocktails that we ordered were quite tasty.
Overall, this was a nice dinner with good food and wonderful service.",Dined on Wednesday night which includes traditional dancing show. We had the chef‚Äôs selection of 5 courses. Make sure you are hungry! The food is delicious and showcases local cuisine. It‚Äôs fine dining out in the open so enjoy the experience. We were delighted.,"Beautiful restaurant nestled in the rice fields.  Staff was unbelievably gracious and made our experience memorable.  Ordered the Chef‚Äôs Choice Option - 5 Courses.  All of which were ‚ÄúOMG, that‚Äôs soo good‚Äù kind of delicious.  Thank you for our best meal in Bali ü§ç",First time going to restaurant.  Best go just before daylight.  Beautiful walk to the restaurant.  The staff awaits you. Seat you to your table. I went for set course with pair cocktail.  Great experience.  Staff are friendly with smile.,"The best meal I had in Bali.

Tucked away a few minutes‚Äô walk into the forest, you‚Äôll be greeted by the lovely staff and the trappings of nature amid a rice paddy. Animals were leisurely grazing  next to the restaurant and koi fish were swimming in the restaurant‚Äôs pond.

The staff recommended some dishes for me and each was excellent. The mixed juice drink used a natural straw the restaurant grew themselves.

Well worth the asking price."

The eggplant was undercooked and a little too oily. Love the concept here of self service, very convenient if you're really hungry and on the go as a vegan. Only 70k for this whole plate! Yum, also looks like they change the menu options, will definitely come back to try more","I think the other reviews say it all: Lovely freshly made vegan buffet, pay as you go, plus some wonderful cakes/desserts if you want a treat afterwards üßÅ üòã A bit of roasted noise but that‚Äôs typical in Bali!",Really nice food! Buffet style so you can try a lot of things for relatively little money. It‚Äôs self service but the lady was very friendly too,"Really enjoyed the food.

Everything tasted really good. I took most of the vegetables, something that had tofu and seitan on a stick.

For dessert I went for the chocolate oatcake (at least I think that's what it was. I really enjoyed this).

I do think that 8k per spoon is a bit small/too expensive on the veg, most places do this for 5k and with a claw server, not a spoon. Portion size felt a little small when going for more veg.

Overall definitely would go ahead but avoid the veg and stick to the bulkier items.","Self service buffet warung, foods are good but not so many options available, everything is vegan, pretty affordable, staff is really kind"

Thank you Irini and all the beautiful souls that work with you. I will miss your kindness, compassion and all the positive energy that you clearly infuse all your food with :) until next time... I wish Samyama all the success and look forward to visiting again when I return to Bali.","I have never tasted vegan food before and this place made me change my mind about it.

I'm serious üòä I was in a 22-day training program at Samyama, and each day, every meal was like a feast! The quality of the food, the amount, the taste...
