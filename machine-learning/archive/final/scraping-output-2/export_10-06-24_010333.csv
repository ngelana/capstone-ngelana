The prize is also quite affordable. We can work here or just chat with friends. It has indoor and outdoor area. The only disturbing thing is the big fly(ies)that kept flying around my food & drink and also landed on my food & even inside glass. It's so annoying T.T","My second time coming here! The coffee was veryyy good! My favorite typical of coffeee! The snack is good! Prefer if you wanna come at night, more good vibes than afternoon.

Ya best know how to hover.","A cool hangout place for young children ,,, the place is quite wide and the best place is the sofa in the corner ,, the parking space is a bit limited, this cool place for coffee has the good coffee flavor which is not expensive and they also provide some snacks but only can  ordered after 12 o'clock.","Actually the hazelnut chocolate drink and the ambience was nice, the only thing I didn't like was there was a very, very, loud group that really bothered me. I couldn't hear my husband talked to me. It was just bad. Oh and I wish the staff who took my order would be nicer."
