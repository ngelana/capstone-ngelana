It's the epitome of cozy and clean, making it perfect for a honeymoon or a family holiday. The staff were incredibly friendly and the service was top-notch. Loveee their Indian food as well, you guys should try it too! Already planning our next visit, we can't wait to come back! ‚ô•Ô∏è","Highly disappointed with our stay. A very beautiful property but poorly maintained. Bed was stained and swimming pool was dirty.

Apart from this, they provide activities like cycling tour, rafting, ATV ride etc. Staffs are also polite and provide good service. Breakfast has a small portion of main course, fruit platter and juice.",Very Disappointed üòûüòû. No Tv channels available in the rooms which is basics needs of these days. Lots of noise from near by rooms with guest. You can not enjoy your privacy in this hotel . No Gym or fitness facility in hotel. Far from the city centre . Over priced üòî hotel.,"We stayed here for 2 nights during our Bali Trip in June 2023. I booked online. The payment process ia very simple, I paid by card here.
The room was huge with an excellent private pool. The bed, seating chairs, toilets all are very very wonderful. They also gave a small cake for my daughter's birthday. They also arrange our Sightseeing and airport dropping cars, our dinner and Floating Breakfast. Serene rice fields and a breathtaking view of the volcano from our room, we really enjoyed. A little bit distant from Ubud Market Place but the ambience is calm and refreshing. Thank you","Title: Disappointing Experience at Alam Puisi Hotel, Bali

I recently stayed at Alam Puisi Hotel in Bali and unfortunately had an extremely disappointing experience. The level of service provided was very poor, and the staff were exceptionally rude throughout my stay.

One of the most concerning aspects was the breakfast service, which was limited to only one serving during my entire stay. This is unacceptable considering that breakfast is a fundamental part of a hotel experience.

Furthermore, the cleanliness of the swimming pool was severely lacking. It was evident that the pool had not been properly maintained, and this greatly impacted my enjoyment and relaxation during my stay.

Overall, I would not recommend Alam Puisi Hotel to anyone seeking a pleasant and comfortable stay in Bali. The lack of adequate service, rude staff behavior, and subpar amenities such as the dirty swimming pool made my experience far from enjoyable."

Will surely come here again on our next trip to Bali.","Wonderfully kind and accommodating staff and a beautiful resort. The pool is stunning and our room was very private and spacious. The bed is what dreams of made of - best nights sleep ever! üò¥üí§ The shuttle times are super convenient and make you forget you are outside the town, it feels like a quick zip into town to do any shopping or dining out üå∫üå¥","Amazing property, fantastic staff who go the extra mile. Stayed in Villa which overlooked rice fields. The private pool was large, the guest pool area was stunning and the grounds were truly special.",Very nice hotel. My only problem was the farm next door. We were woken up at 5 am every day because of the cockerels next door.,Absolutely an amazing place. The staff was so lovely and our son couldn‚Äôt stop playing with them. The place is gorgeous including the surrounding area. Would definitely stay here again

Amaze with the architecture and so Balinese style!,"I have now stayed at Alam Sembuwuk for 1 month and I love it. The staff is SO friendly. The location is a little far out of town, about 15 minutes, but I have rented a scooter and I prefer the nature and to be outside the business of the center, so this works great for me. Their food is nice and there is a good pool as well. I highly recommend staying with these kind-hearted people in this resort. The rooms are spacious, water is hot, the daily cleaning service is nice. There is no kitchen, I wish there was at least a hot plate, but otherwise it‚Äôs great. üòÄ"

The private pool was great and very relaxing. My concern was that the hotel was a bit far from the main activities and city center, so it is important to plan your transportation when in there. Also, the hotel is full of ups and downs and the steps were huge, so be prepared for that. The staff was helpful and friendly.","Great room, but hard to access with a lot of luggage due to a lot of stairs. But the staff carried it all.
Once you reach the room the view is just amazing with the private pool!

The complaints I have is that there wasn't a shaver available. I thought that would be included in a 5-star hotel. Also the hotel is hard to find and once you want to go out on a tour it's hard to find a taxi/grab in that location.

I was a bit disappointed with the breakfast. It's a buffet with limited options. A a la carte would've been great.","I really enjoyed staying here with my then future ex-partner.

The breakfast was nice, the views, and the pool(s).",Beautiful rooms and very neat. Only issues were the toilets with glass doors. The curtains didn't seem to cover much üòÅ But otherwise the staff is super sweet and helpful.,"Don't let the rundown exterior of this place put you off we where nearly going to cancel when we saw the  neglected grounds and empty rooms being used as storage for junk, thankfully we didn't as the large suite room was fantastic,  nice jungle veiw with 2 balconies. Shame the gym isn't open yet we were really disappointed about that. Breakfast is pretty good also."

As the bike is electric bike so we didn't feel tired and it is easy to operate. The track s were also really peaceful. We went through the serene  paddy fields, papaya garden, got chances to see ""kokoan birds"", we visit 1 local temple, and we also step by to a beautiful waterfall. Within the tour they provides a whole coconut fruit.

The team was also very nice and tactful. So, overall it was such an amazing experience for our family. It is recommended. Thank you Blissful Bali Bike tour ‚ú®",,,,
