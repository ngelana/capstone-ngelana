My recommended food is Blayag (this is their traditional food,made from rice)

This peaceful place has the most delicious food for all the traditional or modern food lovers out there. The restaurant is open from 8:00 am until 6:00 pm. The restaurant is located right in the middle of the city of Singaraja, Bali. I'm usually there with my friends and family. I enjoy ordering Satay Pelecing chicken or spicy chicken roasted in banana leaves and iced tea.The restaurant is spacious and has lots of trees so it looks lovely and fresh and the strains of Balinese music sound sometimes when I eat here. The foods and drinks are also delicious and affordable. However, the service is a little slow and it's best when you want to eat here not on holidays, because usually this restaurant does not accept guests because the place is used as a place for weddings or other events. I recommend this place to spend time with family because the place is spacious and comfortable.","This place might look like a restaurant for some reason, but they still call themselves Warung. So maybe don't expect too much? The place looks very traditional, you can choose to sit on the dining room or the gazebos. I don't think it has romantic ambiance, so better go with family, friends, or colleagues. I see that it got mixed reviews, but here's what I think: for taste, they are on average. Some dishes are very delicious but I think they don't really care about the rest. I always go for Ayam Bakar, Sate Plecing, Udang Goreng, Cap Cay and Sop Buntut, and I think those are what they are hyped for. All drinks are good in my opinion. I'm not sure about rest of the menu. Can't say I had a bad experience, but I don't think have the friendliest staff and I think they can/should improve. There's a wedding venue here and mushalla (praying room) for Muslim visitors.","The service took too long, there's only one waitress
They served kind of traditional fast food, but it's not fast at all
Not recommended
Servis nya lelet","A strange restaurant with waiters as if not interested in working. I ordered drinks and foods, and had to wait so long ( more than 30 minutes for nothing. No drinks,no foods till i decided to go)there was no confirmation at all from the waiter whether the drink or food I ordered was there or not. The place is pretty good, but not well maintained, dusty, lots of spider nests, and the book menu is also dustyüëé",Not bad. Prices are good. Food and service are acceptable.

""Thank you""
Thank you Danke for making great food and kopi at reasonable local prices.

We had lunch there today and has a great experience.

Burgers are great with big meat patties,  far better than the ""international food franchise "" further down the road.

Coffee was great also.

Ambience is great you are able to watch the busyness outdoors from your table.

Parking available streetside.
Location is great,  almost town centre with a high profile situation.

There is clean (shared with another business) rest rooms and hand washing facilities available out the back.

Customer service was prompt and efficient.

Would I come back again?
Most Definitely!!!

We will be back to try more from their menu

Well done
