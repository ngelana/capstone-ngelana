Divided in to 3 buildings, blok A, B, and C. Park area is in the basement.",Good for children‚Äôs clothes (paid 25-50k per item). Stalls are repetitive in terms of the stock. Sellers are very persistent so be prepared and firm with what you‚Äôre willing to pay. I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd travel to Sukawati specifically for this market but if you‚Äôre in the area it‚Äôs worth a visit.,"Always start with the highest floor first to set the cheapest price, and then go to the lower floor to compare the price & products.. after you get the best choice, u buy it ü§£","Nice shopping experience here, you can buy clothes, fabrics, paintings & art crafts that sold in Pasar Seni Ubud or Canggu art market with better price, but you need to bargain first. Don't complain about bargaining or why they don't add price tag, cuz basically that's what local people do in the market for long time. As Indonesian, I grew up with bargaining and that's what we do...

There's also big parking lot at the basement so don't worry if you bring car or motorcycle.

The ground floor is the area for art crafts & paintings, the 1st till 3rd floor sell mostly the same, clothes, t-shirts & fabrics...","This art market has a good collection of various articles. You can choose between clothing, home decoration and jewellery. If you come to Bali as a tourist. You can purchase souvenirs for yourself and family/friends. I also recommend visiting the local shops, just outside the main Art market, where there are local manufacturers and wholesalers who can offer merchandise at very reasonable prices."

Content is: rice, urap, fried tofu, steam tofu, and bumbu/sauce , u can ask for more bumbu/sauce.
This one good for vegan","The owner is nice and polite, but the food is okay only. Not so much flavor on the fried tofu but the crispy one is gooodddd, the sambal is flavorful, savory, and spicy, but without it the food is bland.

Ordered the nasi tahu with teh pucuk and crispy tempeh total was 20k. Pricey for a non meat meal tbh.","The best rice In my life. It‚Äôs made with fire wood, steamed in bamboo vessel which is specifically made for cooking rice traditionally.
The banana leaf is excellent.
The spices for my Indian pallet was homecoming!
I felt I had new lungs after the 2nd serving.
I‚Äôm going come here often.

It‚Äôs AUTHENTIC. Don‚Äôt try to scale this gem."

Mmm.  Mmmm. Good!","One of the good places to chill in Sukawati. They have a huge variety of juice and coffee. They also have some selection of food from snacks, meals, and today‚Äôs special. The lychee tea is really fresh and the meat lovers pizza was delicious! overall I like the atmosphere of this place. I really recommend this place if you just want to work on something or just chill near Sukawati Art Market.","Lovely little cafe.
Love the kakadu snack platter.
Would be nice if they make the juices and blend it with ice inside.","Went to Sukawati Art Market and craving for some food. Then we went to KaKaDu Cafe in the lunch time. Food is amazing! We ordered Aburi Salmon Sushi, Spaghetti, Seafood Fried Rice, and Potato Wedges and honestly we love it. Staff is super friendly and helpful."

The restaurant is small but warm and friendly, real Thai hospitality from Phuket.

If you come to Bali, and want Thai food, this is where you.","Very authentic Thai food, taste like home. The pad Thai was very original and not dry. Price was very reasonable. Ibu is very sincere,  hospitable and kind. Can tell she put her heart into making the food. Would surely go back for her food again! Tea and coffee are on the sweet side.","Hi there üëãüèº

Upon visiting this cozy caf√© in Sukawati, I was pleasantly surprised by the authenticity and sophistication of the Thai dishes they offer. Particularly memorable were dishes such as Tom Yum with shrimp, the rich and fragrant Red Curry, and the spicy Pad Kraprao Ayam. Each dish was prepared with special attention to detail, and you could feel that the chefs truly put their heart into their work. This place is a real find for gourmets and those who appreciate Thai cuisine at its finest. Don‚Äôt miss the chance to visit this caf√© if you find yourself in Bali!

Can pay by card and cash
Gojek delivery also availableüëçüèº","While food was amazing, our family was really disappointed to realize we were being cheated on the bill. We were charged correctly the first time, but I think it was only because we were low on cash and adding up the items in front of the cashier. The second and third times, random charges were added, inflating the total by about 40,000 rupiah. When we confronted the cashier on the third visit, she even admitted to the overcharging. Why not just leave a tip jar instead of trying to cheat foreigners?",The food is amazing. Thank you so much. Tastes so good. I was losing hope for food in Bali and here in Ubud found great food. A selection of delicious noodle dishes and burn your tongue paw paw dish. The reviews were right.
