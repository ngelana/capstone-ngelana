Visited the playground twice recently after a major renovation. They have removed all the broken, chipped, unsaved play spots with new safe ones. They spread imitation grass on the ground so it's clean for kids to play.
Lapangan Puputan is a big square. Particularly the corner where this playground is always busy with kids, parents, and food sellers. This playground is always crowded during the day and especially afternoons, couple hours before dusk.
I could only think of more sitting place for parents while attending the kids playing.","During an event, it's quite chaotic, but the police are helping the traffic, so it's under control.

We were visiting a festival event of ogoh-ogoh (demon visualization art), great time to bring your kids as long as you mature enough to describe what it is.","Perfect for walks and jogs. The many trees on this park really freshen up the air despite its surrounding traffic. They also have calisthenic bars to workout on, some swings for kids to play with, and sitting areas for people to chill at.","This field is located next to the official residence of the governor of Bali which has an area of 35,000 m2. This is my favorite place when I want to exercise. The place is nice, clean, beautiful with lots of beautiful plants around the field. The facilities here are parking lots and public toilets. The parking lot itself is spacious and clean, but the toilets are generally not clean and smelly. For this reason, the government must emphasize signs for the community so that they can maintain toilet cleanliness by giving warning signs and fines to people who do not maintain toilet cleanliness. Apart from the toilets, these warning signs must be posted in every corner of the field so that the community can maintain the cleanliness of the field.

Here there are also street swords who trade around the parking lot and the temple. The food is delicious but the price given is quite expensive in my wallet as a student. Here there is also a children's playground and a place that contains equipment for exercising which is still kept clean. However, in some children's toys there are damaged due to being climbed on by adults and for this reason the government also needs to put up warning signs to prevent adults from playing on children's games.","this park is clean and quite well maintained, activities of local usually take time in the morning and afternoon"

They exhibit all the artifacts related to Balinese culture and present them into a very nice storyline. I visited this museum three times in 2019 because this museum is my research object and I still remember the storyline.

If you visit this museum you'll get charge a ticket (in 2019 it was 10k rupiah if I'm not mistaken) and there is a locker for you to leave your baggage. And you'll be guided to go to the first building (there are 4 permanent exhibition buildings as I remember).

The first building shows you stories and general facts about Bali and some artifacts from ancient times such as farming tools, stones, etc. The second building is more of some ritual things from birth, wedding, and funeral. The third building is an economic thing like the Chinese coins they used in the past, etc. The last building contains a keris collection and some big figures of their mythical creatures.

The museum administration was really helpful. They sell some souvenirs, snacks, and drinks in the reception area. They have an administration building, conservation building, collection building, and two (as I remember) bales. On my third visit, they held a Balinese traditional dance practice for young girls. That was so beautiful. Sadly I didn't document it.

I hope more tourists will visit this museum too, not just the beach clubs. I hope more people see Bali as a whole, their culture and history included not just the recreation things. They're historically beautiful.","The architecture is beautiful but the displays are just average. However, it's still a good starting point to learn a few things about the local culture. The biggest issue actually is the lack of air-con... even the fans are not working!",Great museum with lots of history. Had an excellent English speaking guide who took us all around telling us the history of Bali.,"Very small museum. Takes less than 20 minutes to see everything. Online it says tickets are 50k per person but they charged me 100k. There are fake ‚Äútour guides‚Äù who pretend to work there and show you around and later ask for ridiculous amount of money. Didn‚Äôt even ask for a guide, he invited himself.  I can‚Äôt believe this kind of scams are allowed to happen inside a government building! Be very careful when you go there.","Good cultural and historical information on Bali. Our Guide Made was friendly attentive and knowledgeable

Improvements would be better lighting on all displays and the installation of some fans to get the air moving as it is very hot and stuffy inside the buildings

Apart from that it was definitely worth doing if you want to know more about the history and true culture of Bali"

Because as per the google it is very beautiful and big. Didn‚Äôt see that. Small average place. Nothing special. At the entrance it was a man asking for some money for the temple. I gave him 10000 rupees. They have a guest book where you can put your name, country and amount you gave. He entered with me snd after all tried to get from me more money. So bad experience. Unfortunately it destroyed all impressions I had.","I recently had the opportunity to visit the Jagatnatha Temple in Denpasar, Bali and it was truly an incredible experience. The temple is located in the heart of the city and is a beautiful piece of architecture. The intricate carvings and detailed statues are a testament to the skill and dedication of the craftsmen who built it.

The temple is dedicated to Ida Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa, who is considered to be the ruler of the universe and is believed to be the protector of the people of Bali. The temple is a popular place of worship for the local Hindu community and is also visited by many tourists.

The atmosphere inside the temple is peaceful and serene. The incense and the sound of the temple bells add to the spiritual ambiance. I was able to take part in a traditional prayer ceremony which was conducted by a Hindu priest. The ceremony was quite moving and I felt a sense of calm and tranquility wash over me.

The temple also has a rich history. It was built in the 17th century by the King of Bali, Dewa Agung Jambe, who was a devout Hindu. The temple has undergone several renovations over the years and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Overall, my experience at the Jagatnatha Temple was truly unforgettable. It was an opportunity to learn about the culture and religion of Bali and to gain a deeper understanding of Hinduism. I would definitely recommend a visit to this temple to anyone who is interested in learning more about the spiritual side of Bali. So, it is a must visit place for those who are interested in history, culture and religion.","Nice temple but scammed for sarrong and then he wanted more money once inside. Then hassle to buy stuff inside with one person following us for about half a mile down the street, ruinned the experience.","At first we only want to go to the museum and this guy stop us and ask if we need a tour, we said ok, he put ""sarung"" on us and charge 50k IDR per person for the sarung and ask for 10 USD for the tour which is in my opinion was not woth it, I feel tricked and I am sure many people feel the same. My advice just go straight to the Bali museum, and get a ticket there and also tour for 20k IDR"

We waiting for food until 1 hour. The service team just talk each other not care with the customer.
As u guys can see, The chicken was so oily. Texture of Fried Rice was so bad and the taste only Tomato Ketchup.
Not recommended at all.","Recommended Chinese food, authentic, tasty and worth it to buy. The space is not big enough, so it looks crowded, but it's still ok coz we got good food üòä","It's beyond my expectations. Very nice service and prices. They give a reasonable portion of food. The only problem is that place a little bit small for a restaurant. I hope they'll move to another place and make it bigger than before. Overall, I totally satisfied with the foods! Good job!",Average food but still acceptable. Restaurant looks a bit dated on the inside but at least still okay and clean. One of the few restaurants inside Pertokoan Udayana.,I ordered 'Mie Ayam Jamur' and 'Ayam Kuluyuk'. Good food with big portion. Reasonable price. Suitable for family.

It was tasty but the portion was on the small side. Of note, prices have increased. The sign outside said 12000, reviews here say 10000 but there is a handwritten note at the counter telling that it's recently gone up to 15000. Not expensive but other vegetarian local places give soup with a larger portion for the same price.",Quality Indonesian Vegetarian food with good selections at super affordable price.

I am lucky enough to live in Bali where vegetarian food is easily found but variety of food could be challenging most of the times and not to mention most of the food could be overly fried or just simply oily and thou I know I'm healthy enough but it's absolutely better to stay away from those kind of junk vegetarian food, and I think I've found the answer at this place.

they've just opened last August 2020, even at times of pandemic, they manage to give abundance of free Nasi Bungkus to those in need frequently üëè #RESPECT üëç","I try have a meal here at least once a month since its next to my fav pasar.

The Coconut Orange is too sweet.","When you crave for local dishes, this is definitely the place. They serves Balinese local dishes like tipat, ikan teri, nasi goreng and many more for affordable price. And it's located at heart of the city too just the opposite of Bali museum. I recommend to try the tipat and jajan Bali. Looking forward to come here again","The food is yum! Really local taste ‚Äì- the crowd can definitely certify its authenticity!
