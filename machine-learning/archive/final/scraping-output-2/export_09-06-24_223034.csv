ChIJ03kvra2P0S0R-laKk2HuLV0,Fiji Swing reception,-8.1983266,115.1806042,"Dusun Nyuh, Lemukih, Kec. Buleleng, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81171, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=6714284722333832954,CLOSED_TEMPORARILY,,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.4,16,,"Starting point of the trekking down to Fiji waterfall. The entrance fee was pretty expensive, like 25~30$ per person. You can also take a mountain motorbike service to reduce the trekking time. However, the motorbike service doesn't provide any safety gear. Also, the trekking path has scores of stairs, which might be strenuous for some people. I also recommend bringing watershoes or flip-flops since there are parts you have to walk over the creek.","Best way to Visit both Waterfalls, both of them breath taking! They guys are amazing, super friendly, good english, will take you to see world famous north bali swing, rice fields and water slide! The water slide is so much fun and you literally spend half and hour just going up down

I give them five stars, but would give more!

Best advice, go there and talk to them, explain what you want to see and for how long!

Ace!",Be prepared to climb over 400+ steps and see the most mesmerizing waterfalls in Bali. Sekumpul and Fiji are a must visit.,"Coman, the guide at this company was absolutely fantastic! He was patient, helpful and kind. Mum lost her flip-flop shoe in the water when crossing the flowing river and Coman, the hero he is crossed the gushing waters and rocks and retrieved it from the other side of the river in the bush! The tour started off trekking to sekumpul waterfall - which was breathtaking and our guide was very encouraging in getting us to swim under the waterfall Which we were so happy we did and thank you for all The beautiful photos! We then went to Fiji waterfall which was so beautiful just wish there were less unthoughtful tourists. Then a scooter ride through the ricefeilds to Lemukih natural waterslide which was SO FUN and the staff were so lovely and welcoming! We had our first fried banana at Lemukih and god was it good. Lunch was also included in the tour overlooking the ricefeilds and it was SO TASTY. Highly recommend this tour. Couldnâ€™t have asked for a better day!","Very beautiful!
Great guide"
