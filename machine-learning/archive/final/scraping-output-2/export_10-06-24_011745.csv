Our room was very nice, they cleaned it every day during the our stay. We rented a scooter from them and it‚Äôs very close to many beaches and restaurants. Pool was nice, not busy at all so you can enjoy it. The only downside was the food(although good (not the best one) the breakfast(we had included in our final price) was quite poor) and there were lots of caterpillars around our villa and inside on the wooden walls and bathroom. They are nice people, willing to help you if you have any query and they let us enjoy the pool after we checked out, give us towels and offered a place where we could shower as we had the flight in the evening.","The quaintness of this location was fantastic and the staff were outstanding. The best service that I have had while in Bali.

The setup is great for larger groups, as you can then book out the majority of the villas.

The restaurant food was some of the best quality on the island. A very personal experience and friendly atmosphere.

Truly some of the best food and friendly people.","Good:

This property is conveniently located and pretty close to all the restaurants, beaches and grocery stores.

Staff is friendly and helpful. You can rent a bike at the reception for a good price, although helmets were old and dirty.

Food choices are simple but still filling and delicious.  (we liked fruit plate and pancakes, omelette is also tasty!)

The territory is clean and quiet, we had our cabin cleaned every day.

Need improvements:

Towels were washed but worn out with stains that didn‚Äôt come off after the washes. (See picture)

Keep in mind that in the cabin it was very dark and we had to open the bathroom and the front doors to let some natural light in.

Black caterpillars are everywhere- hundreds are on the property and they do go inside the cabin and often you will find a few in the bathroom (shower mostly), on the room floor and on the walls!

Moldy smell in the cabin.

Table in the cabin is very small - not suitable for work or just sitting (your knees will be hitting the shelf below the table)

Small wardrobe and not enough hangers and shelves/hooks in the cabin in general.","Beautiful place with wonderful staff, a tasty breakfast and a peaceful and quiet environment. It‚Äôs so relaxing, the rooms are very clean with a lovely breakfast delivered to your room on time every morning. It is a little far of a walk to anywhere but a cheap ride. Over all a beautiful stay and would love to go back",Really nice hotel with friendly staff. The breakfast is delicious. The rooms are nice and clean. We would recommend this place‚Äôs to anyone seeking in good quality stay. üëç

Location: Near to town within minutes of car/bike ride. Convenient despite being away from the hustles. I even walked back one evening.

Premise: seemingly built around forested area, comes with on site restaurant that serves really good food. Room is decently sized with en-suite bathroom. Huge bed with fresh clean linens. Nice pool. Careful the floor is very hot in the day! An equipped space for yoga.

Some improvements could include better (and repair) lights to guide the pathway around the premise esp after sunset. A lot of worms when I was there, which is the only worry I had during my stay - it‚Äôs not for people who mind this. At times, there‚Äôs the musty smell in the room but not overly powering. Otherwise, a pleasant stay at good value.","It was a pure pleasure staying in this resort surrounded by nature and very nice personnel. The room was not only spacious but also tastefully furnished, I loved having a closet in the bathroom!  The fully stocked yoga shallot was perfect for unwinding and practicing in serene surroundings. The pool and the lounging area are also very relaxing, always found place and swimming pool is big enough to swim. The restaurant Forage is another place worth recommending - the food is so good and made my stay even more enjoyable!
In general, as a solo female traveler I felt safe and even taken care of, I highly recommend it.","lovely stay. The staff really make you feel like home away from home. We stayed in one of the bigger rooms as we where travelling as a family with kids - nice and bright. The food is very good with a good selection for kids - lots of interesting and tasty local ingredients and unprocessed ethos, no seed oils also which i loved.

I really loved that they have a sauna, cold plunge and steam room - its a complete wellness centre and you can do yoga on demand but we didnt get a chance to try that out. Locations is great - close enough to all the famous beaches but still hidden away in nature away. Perfect for a Bali family holiday. My kids loved the evening they put on the fire pit for us!","I stayed here for 3 days and enjoyed every moment.
It‚Äôs not low budget, but Kaya Mama lived up to the expectations raised by not being low budget. Rooms were clean, staff friendly and facilities as promised on the fotos.
Only downside was a few aggressive moskitos, not in my room though.","Such a special place, I highly recommend. The ambiance the hospitality of the staff gives such a sense of relaxation and holiday. It has an all in one which makes it perfect to unwind, with a cold plunge, sauna, yoga classes that almost feel private. And to top it all off the restaurant is a hidden gem in Bali. Such a perk to have an incredible restaurant inside your villa stay."

Adi abian villa is very quiet, there is the swimming pool, some beds to lay and enjoy the sun!
There is also a shared kitchen of you want to cook your own meals. You can buy water, Coca Cola.
We went to nusa Penida 2 days and while we were there, they clean the room and put clean linen and towels!
At the beginning they provided us beach towels.
With a little extra money, the owner came to pick us up from the airport and drop us the day we had the flight.
The owner was ready to help us in everything; he also suggested a place to rent the motorbike.
Absolutely recommended!!","Really a wonderful place to stay! The property is absolutely beautiful and well maintained. It has a very cozy feel to it. The rooms are gorgeous, clean, and comfortable. Bathrooms are large and have plenty of hot water. The beds are by far the most comfortable I have slept in while in Bali. The staff is super friendly and helpful, they will do whatever they can to make sure you have a pleasant stay. You definitely won‚Äôt regret staying here! üòá

10/10","We just can‚Äôt say enough good things about this gem of a stay. We‚Äôve been here for over a month and fall more in love with our experience every day. Waking up to sunshine and birds singing outside, beautifully maintained pool and really just the nicest, most caring staff. We‚Äôve been traveling Bali for 6 months and stayed in multiple places: this one has been our favorite. We are so lucky to have found it. Strong wifi has been a big plus to be able to work from paradise, cleanliness is top, and every detail inside room is well maintained. Keep in mind the location is perfect to enjoy all of uluwatu and binging. I could keep typing but you get the point. Don‚Äôt look anywhere else and just book here‚ô•Ô∏è","This stay was INCREDIBLE. We stayed for almost a month and it had everything we‚Äôve ever wished to work remotely while enjoying in paradise. Staff is always smiley, hard workers, they are so kind and will always help you with anything. The pool spotless, and we also had great luck with neighbours. Really cool vibe and atmosphere for a dream stay. Thank Wayan and all the team! Hope to see you very soon üíñ","I've been living here for a while and the service is excellent üëå the place is peaceful and quiet, close the main amenities but secluded enough. The rooms are super clean and comfortable, the bathroom very spacious, the pool is also very clean, the common area super lovely and most importantly, Wayan, Ketut and everyone working there is absolutely amazing! üëç they go above and beyond to ensure guests have a great time! they're caring and thoughtful!

Kitchen is shared and kept nice and tidy as well as a very aethetic pool.

Decent location but still a little bit of a travel to any beach but a welcome place to return to after a day of travels.",We stayed at uluwatu village house for 3 nights and it was perfect. Nice quiet location but 10 minute drive to lots of shops/cafe‚Äôs. The room was super clean and you could tell it had been very recently renovated to a very modern finish. We met the owner of the resort and he was a very nice man. He lives on site with his family who are on hand literally 24/7 to assist with anything you need. I would definitely stay again and would highly recommend. The only negative things I could say was that the bed in our room was rather squeaky every time you moved. The lighting inside could have also been a little bit better. Both very minor things and neither of which ruined our stay.,"One of the best places we have ever stayed on Bali. Perfect location in between everything. Wayan and his family are so friendly and helpful. Felt like home away from home. The room itself is very comfortable, clean and spacious.

A big bonus is also the great pool as well as the kitchen you can use for free! We also had a great scooter from Wayan which made getting around easy.","My partner and I had a lovely week long stay at Uluwatu village house. The room was simplistic, clean and perfectly comfortable, everything we needed, even a pool to cool off during the day. The location is great, about 10 minutes from the main area of Uluwatu so much more peaceful yet still easy access to shops and cafes. Our host was very accomodating and organised a very nice scooter we could rent for the week as well as helping us with airport transfer. Excellent value for money accomodation!","I had an excellent stay at Uluwatu Village House. The owner and his family were incredibly welcoming and friendly, making me feel right at home. The shared kitchen was a great feature, allowing me to cook my own meals and save money. The room was comfortable and clean, with everything I needed for a pleasant stay. I highly recommend Uluwatu Village House for anyone looking for a cozy and welcoming place to stay in the area."

Let‚Äôs get to the basics first. The room is spacious, and clean. Rooms have their own private bathrooms with hot running water. The establishment has a shared kitchen with fresh drinking water, cooker and refrigerator. It is off the main road so the rooms are away from the hustling and bustling noise of the Indonesian scooters.

Room service is limited however fresh towels will be given upon request. The family running the place are very sweet and helpful. You can rent a scooter from them for 100k per day (a bit pricey from experience but it was filled with petrol already).

Location wise is amazing as it is close by to all the good beaches, beach clubs and other attractions that ate worth visiting in the area. There are restaurants and laundry services really close to the guesthouse as well.","I was visiting my friends staying at this place, so this is my impression of the place. The name says correctly hidden as it is off the road, and the road to the guesthouse is sandy and small. Not so much luxury here, but relative lower price.","This stay is really good. The apartments are decently equipped, offer A/C and a big comfortable bed.
Outside are different possibilities to relax and chill after an exhausting day. The site is nicely located and within a short time you can reach different beaches and attractions around the peninsula by bike.
The hosts are friendly and always helpful.","Very comfortable beds (possibly the most comfortable we had in three weeks in Bali) and clean, spacious rooms. No idea how they're charging the amount that they do, but it's an absolute bargain without feeling like you're settling for less.

Check-in is very smooth and the family who runs it is friendly, always saying hi and waving. Scooter rental 80k/day and they also offer airport pickup and drop off (in our case, they were nice enough to drive us to the airport with ten minutes notice).

Location - you'll want a scooter to get around if you stay here. Very close to multiple beaches and Uluwatu Temple, as well as some very good restaurants and coffee shops (Bukit Sausage and El Merkat were favorites of ours).","Beautiful, clean and easy as well as cheap! Would recommend to anyone. Lovely room and bathroom with hot water. The host couldn't do enough for you, breakfast, scooter hire and laundry. Can't rate it highly enough"

Great shower, hot water, silent AC.

Ketut the manager is a great guy. Always making sure you‚Äôre happy and content.

Only downside is lots of noise from the neighbours. The wooden design means no soundproofing, you can hear everything.","We stayed there for one night.
The stuff was super kind, they kept our baggages during the day as we arrived before the check-in time.
The bedroom was clean but you could hear lot of noises coming from the close neighbourhood. Probably you could sleep better taking some earplugs with you.
The bathroom was alright, a little bit small because taking a shower everything got wet (especially the toilet that is just next to the shower).
Beautiful garden and good location to go to the Temple and to tourist places.
We also rent a motorbike for the day there. It came with a full tank and two helmets for 130k.","Upon arrival staff were friendly and carried our bags to the room. The room was small but kept clean and tidy! The hotel overall isn‚Äôt the problem, however the surrounding noise of dogs and roosters caused really disrupted our sleep.
