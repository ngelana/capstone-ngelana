They are really passionate about their work! They were engaged with us during the whole trip and they made a wholesome experience:

picking us up / chill in the base camp with drinks / adventurous boat trip and snorkeling spots + water and snacks in the boat / lunch break in the base camp with homemade food and coffee + chill time / kayak in the forest / drive to home

during all of this they shoot us with their üì∑

and you feel safe with them no matter the conditions. Fully recommend them!!!

Thank you guys! Keep up the good work because you are making unforgettable memories to your clients! Magic! üôè","Incredible Lembongan snorkeling trip! Spotted a group of 8-10 manta rays and a turtle at Crystal Bay. Tour guides were fantastic, attentive, and ensured our safety.  Exhilarating experience - deserves a 6-star rating if possible!","Definitely would recommend this company for snorkling. Everything is very well organised from pick up to drop off.
Team is friendly and seems very professional. The equipment is in a very good condition so was pleasant to use it. Welcome drink, snacks and towels are a great bonus.
GoPro photoshoot is just amazing - it‚Äôs so beautiful there under water that is absolutely worth to have pics from there.
Unfortunately we weren‚Äôt lucky to see mantas, but well you never know. Otherwise we saw tons of beautiful fishes, corals and even a turtle. Also the trip on the boat itself was great, as we saw the islands from the water (Penida one) and the colours and beauty is excellent.
Thanks a lot, guys! Keep doing a great job ü´∂üèº","Best experienced for Snorkeling Trip in three islands paradise (nusa lembongan, ceningan and Nusa Penida). We got pick up from our hotel with friendly driver. The boat is very comfortable and big with experienced captain and crews. The crew took photo with Gopro camera which made your picture so good. We were very enjoy the trip with young coconut. Recommended for everyone...üëçüëçüëç","Fantastic snorkelling trips, we went one day and didn‚Äôt find any manta rays so we went back the next day and they tried another spot and found them. The guide, Young Coconut is excellent and everything is run very well. Equipment is good. Three separate stops with different things to see at each. Despite seeing so much it still only took 3/4 hours so you have the rest of the afternoon to relax. Photos are included in the price which is such a nice extra."

We did a 3 hour snorkeling trip to mangrove point, crystal bay, and a third place with corals.
Capt. Blaxy Jr. was professional and knowledgable, and we had some good chats and a lot of fun along the way.

We hoped to see one or two manta rays, but oh my- we got to see 7 manta rays and even a whole flock of dolphins!
I think we were a bit lucky too, but hadn‚Äôt expected that at all.

Since the best hours to go varies, we recommend getting in touch with them before booking your private trip.

We highly recommend doing your snorkeling trip with Blaxy.",Blaxy took us (8 people) on a snorkeling trip to penida and at mangrove point. He was super professional and knowledgeable and patient. Highly recommended,"Captain Blaxy took us out for a short drifting snorkel along the reef. Picked us up from our bungalow and dropped us back. It was great sitting down after the swim and chatting about stuff. A great family owned/run business and very professional.
Can‚Äôt rate the food as we didn‚Äôt eat. Everything else highly rated","Lovely little Warung. Snorkeling, diving and mangrove tours also available here. Highly recommended - this is a small family operation and they take their offerings seriously. Their snorkeling activities offer a couple of stops that are a little less crowded than the standard Crystal & Manta Bay routes.","The most kind family we met on the island! We rested and ate and went snorkeling in the morning. Price is very reasonable, people are very warm. Snorkeling was beautiful and blaxy took really good care of us. Very relaxed enjoyable time. Highlight of the trip."
