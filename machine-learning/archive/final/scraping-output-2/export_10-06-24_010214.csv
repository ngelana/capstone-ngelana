The whole team is extremely friendly and professional which makes it really pleasant to come here. Though the location is a bit far from any touristy area, we enjoyed the serene surroundings and the sea view from the pool and restaurant area. The only drawback we had was that the surrounding fields got burned 2 nights during our stay which caused quite a strong burnt smell mainly in our open bathroom. We were offered a complimentary massage for repeat customers which was relaxing. Thank you for this great time at your hotel! Your service is top-notch and keep it up!","My husband and I chose this resort for our honeymoon and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It is a bit far from the more popular / touristy areas, but it is the perfect getaway. We were sad to hear that the water was too rough and no swimming was allowed because we love the beach, but we were able to access a beach with swimming access about 20 minutes away in Sanur. Aside from that, the service is excellent. They care about providing great service and they all seem happy with their jobs. Everyone is very friendly, even the gardeners would briefly stop their work and say hello as you passed them walking to the amenities.","We've just completed a 5 night stay at this amazing adult only hotel in their one-bedroom suite with private pool. It was so good, that we've already booked again for another 5 nights in August and I'm delighted to share why.

First and foremost, the service throughout our stay was perfection - worthy of the finest 6 star hotel. Every staff member was English speaking, super friendly, professional and conveyed passion in wanting to serve you.

Secondly, the suite and property layout is traditional Balinese style, beautifully maintained, exceptionally clean and stunningly located in gardens on a long black sand beach. It was mesmerizing watching massive waves rolling in only a few meters away so definitely no swimming in the sea during our stay.

Thirdly, the food at the Standing Stones Restaurant was top notch. So good, we didn't venture out of the hotel once, which we would normally do regularly. We were totally pampered by the staff and found it perfect to just relax and unwind. Good Wi-Fi through the property, even around the bar on the edge of the beach. Really... I cannot find a fault worthy of mentioning.

Finally, a big hand to the staff for caring about the stray dogs and puppies on the beach. As passionate pawrents, it was heartening to see they too were being cared for.

Congratulations Mr. Bari, you run the best hotel we've found in Bali and already looking forward to our return visit.","This hotel is lovely for a bit of an escape. We only stayed here for 2 nights and we stayed in the hotel. If you're looking for somewhere that's close to amenities etc. this hotel isn't for you. The staff were very friendly, and a shout out to Okta who was wonderful everytime we encountered him. The food was nice, there was a small issue with the service for dinner one night (think there was a miscommunication in the kitchen) and we were left waiting quite a while for food however they were incredibly apologetic and offered us a complimentary drink so no hard feelings! The view and the hotel grounds are well maintained and the room was lovely. Overall a lovely stay for a peaceful escape.","Location is a little far out but that contributes to the idyllic charm of the hotel. Everything was fantastic and all the staff extremely
polite and friendly.

We were especially impressed that the restaurant staff assiduously recorded our dietary needs to make sure we were covered for the entire stay. Major props to the restaurant for the
range of interesting vegetarian options available and the great cocktails!

Room cleaning twice a day is also amazing at a time when many hotels are cutting back to once every 2-3 days.

The Black Sands Spa lives up to its reviews and the massage and bath were incredibly relaxing.

We truly enjoyed our little slice of paradise and it was a perfect weekend getaway!"

Lunch is weird indeed because there's a pool going through the middle of the restaurant, but this place is really only for dinner or breakfast. They usually also have different entertainment shows scheduled on most nights.

Breakfast is phenomenal! Better than 99% of hotels by whatever standard.

Staff is friendly and very kind. Definitely recommend!","This villa is so excluded to the area. It is right beside a beach viewside for its restaurant. I didn't stay but wanted to visit the restaurant. Honestly, if I were to go back to Bali, I would pick this villa as my stay. There are security guards at the gate entrance as well. 24/7 staff service. It's around 2million IDR per day to stay during the time I was curious of its pricing. Since I just visited, the bill was very expensive for me. You need to spend minimum 200k IDR at the restaurant and the menu does not show the pricing. I had breakfast, and a few drinks, and my total was right above 500k IDR. So at that point, you're better off only going to the restaurant as a villa guest stay instead as a visitor.","Oh wow it's sooo good. I enjoy every moment here. Peaceful vibe. Stunning view. Perfect chill vibe. Professional stuff, high quality service. Tasty food. Love it‚ù§Ô∏è",It's a beautiful place and the staff are very polite and accommodating. Food is really good too and the atmosphere especially on the days with singing from artists is spectacular.,"Amazing atmosphere and views everywhere you look, the service was excellent and the staff were very friendly, the food was outstanding and really delicious we tried several dishes and all of them were mind blowing, a true 5 star experience, there was a band playing acoustic soft music which enhanced the experience, the restaurant is located in a resort and overlooking black sand beach, I would really recommend this place üëå"
