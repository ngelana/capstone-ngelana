So dirty, the room was so discusting. The sheets were not clean and had hole in them, the towels used to be white but were now brown-grey. We took one looked and checked out directly and booked another hotel. In the taxi the driver told us it is known for being haunted. I regret not taking pictures too prove this but we could not get out of there fast enough!","Do not book. The pictures lie. This was the most disgusting room I've been in. Stains on the curtains, bedcovers and sheets. Didn't even want to sit on the bed. Brownish colored bathtowels. Was there for about 5 minutes before we decided to get another hotel. The taxi driver to our new hotel said it also was famous for being haunted. No pictures cus we litterly ran out of there.","I stayed here from October 9th until October 14th for business trip.

The room was quite spacious, with one refrigerator.
Unfortunately, the room where I stayed have no dress cabinet, but that was not an issue to me.
The bathroom was equipped with soap dispensers, which is good thing, most hotel would place soap bar

The TV was showing cable channel and the AC was working fine .. too bad during my stays, I have fever, therefor I cannot stand cold air ;)

This hotel also have swimming pools, not big, but it is nice.

The staff are also very helpful.

Location of Hotel is not on center of denpasar, but rather to the south of Denpasar, between Kuta Beach and Sanur Beach, but you can go anywhere from here ;)

If I come to Bali again with my family, I would stay in here again.","Budget hotel with satisfactory service.

I've stayed in this hotel for 3 days since 27 to 30 Dec 2018 on second floor. No stink and rats as what they told in other review, just barking dog noise from neighbourhood area.

Breakfast is nice in terms of taste, but don't expect much in terms of variety. They only serve fruit/veg salad, white rice, fried rice, veg dish, meat dish, bread, sliced fruit, tea, coffee and juice.

The only downside is it's location isn't strategic enough if you don't rent or come with your own vehicle, quite far from anywhere expect the airport.","Expensive smelly hotel.
This place reeks of rotting trash from the nearby trash collection point. Rooms and corridors are old and not well-maintained. The air-conditioner vibrates and is noisy as hell. Worst possible hotel you can get at Rp 550k price point."
