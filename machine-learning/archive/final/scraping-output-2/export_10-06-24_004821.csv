I really like the ones tilted to the left or right. So very cool.,"Great and strategic place to refresh, relax, or just get out of a crowd. There're food court, local market, play ground, gazebo, benches, tables, basketball field, volleyball field, and also soccer field. It's kinda quite place, except when there's an event or in a peak hour. Unfortunately, it's maintained poorly. But luckily it still can give you a nice view and some sense of nature.","A comfortable place to enjoy a weekend with family. If you are sitting in the garden while enjoying the atmosphere, this place is very comfortable. There is a play area for children.",Good place and many people come here in the weekend. The child playground is so crowded but fine.,"after renovation this park become so much nicer. the view is very clean and neat. people can play basket ball, jogging, or just sit on the grass for sightseeing. but you must prepare parking fee when you want to visit this place."

This understated place serves up some amazing grilled Chicken you can technically only find in Lombok. Luckily they serve it right here in Bali and it is quite the experience.

The last time we went, the place was so jam packed that we had to wait 20 minutes for a table and it was well worth the wait.

The staff even brought us a table out front, but the smoke kept blowing at us so we just opted for sitting inside.

They serve up whole chicken (head and heart included which only costs about 75k per chicken. You can request it to be spicy and non spicy. For additional items, you can add rice for 5k and veggies for another 5k.

The chicken comes out with a super crispy skin and tender meat. Generally people order a chicken to share, but my group of friends went in and ordered 4 chickens! One for each of us! It was so fun and we enjoyed our meal.

Many people do take away, but I believe it‚Äôs best fresh off the grill. This authentic experience is not to be missed! They do offer smaller chickens I heard, but they ran out! Be prepared to wait.",Was in Gianyar and Was hungry find this rumah makan ordered some chicken and sate. The chicken was so skinny and the sate was made of gizzard ( hard like rock ),"This place so legend! Good price, delicious ayam Taliwang üòäüòäüëçüëç",We really did not like anything in there. Most people could not even finish the food. Glad I tried it. Never again.,"Nice food. If you come here near closing time, ayam taliwang already sold out :(
Based on the other reviewer, this resto served halal food. InsyaAllah"
