The property is so quiet and peaceful, it truly feels like an escape from the noise and business of the city streets. All you can hear on the property are birds singing and dogs barking. The rooms are clean, the staff are very helpful, and the location is ideal if you want to be out of the tourist centers but still close to Ubud or Denpasar/ Kuta/ Seminyak. Love it here!","The staff here are so friendly and welcome, they really can‚Äôt do enough for you. The room was the largest we have stayed in during the last 10 months of travelling. It had a huge bed and really high ceilings. The bathroom was the size of most standards rooms. It was nice decorated and had a well stocked bookshelf.
The downside was the complete lack of soundproofing to the other rooms. We could hear every word the couple next door were saying it was as if they were in the room with us. To make things worse they had just flown in and had jet lag so we‚Äôre up all night. The guys in the room on the other side were snoring needless to say I had a very poor nights sleep. üòü","It‚Äôs truly a hidden oasis off the busy part of bali. You can rent a scooter so you easily get to every corner of the island. The owners are super friendly and will help you with everything you could need. The room was spacious, clean and the aircon worked well.
Wish we stayed longer!",We got bedbug bites from our stay there and there were cockroaches in the kitchen where we ate and they store the food. Very beautiful location and design of the hotel but they should do something about the cleaning.,"This place was incredible. I thought the reviews were an exageration of how good the service was but let me tell you... it was better in real. From 200 hotels I visited in my life, this is the best service I received. Staff and owner were really kind and made sure everything was perfect for you. The owner even offered us a meal free of charge and cooked for us. The rooms were incredible. Very big and comfortable. Nice desk to work for me was a bonus. Pool is nice. Loved the nature in the garden. Really relaxing and you feel at home! Totally recommend this place!"

Wish we had recorded the sessions so we could revisit as we shared with each other.  We felt so great afterwards! Bring cash with you as they don‚Äôt have a card machine yet.","I took the full package. For 1500ml
And honestly saying it was not worth it as he was not a master of order opening or Healing checkers . But enjoyed the experience.",This has been byfar my favorite experience in Bali! I got a tremendous healing from the consultation to the numerology to the quantum energy healing. The release of pain and sad was unmatched from any other type of spiritual healing I've ever had. I'd love to go back as often as possible. I wish to learn more from them. It's a dream to work with them in a place such as this everyday of my future existence. ‚ú®Ô∏è üíûüôèüèΩ,"3 of us were looking for spiritual healing sessions during our stay in Bali when we came across the flyer for this place. We were looking to book various different types of sessions with traditional healers.... but we found this place that was able to offer all the various different sessions we were interested in one package. We contacted them and all arrangements were made by Mr Nyoman in very little time. Before we knew it, we even had a car waiting to pick us up from our villa. Upon arrival, the very beautiful and pleasant Sinta welcomed us and explained the process to us. She explained the whole process to us before introducing each of us to our individual healer. The very gentle and soft spoken Mr Komang Wardana introduced himself to me. I was impressed from the Get Go ..... certain things that came out from my palm reading session were on point..... and things only known to me !!!! A lot of guidance and insight was also offered. Next on to the aura cleansing session..... a lot of deep seated issues surfaced..... but mr Wardana very calmly and ably guided me through it and helped me work it out of my system !!! I felt like a load had lifted off my chest and shoulders !!!
The trauma healing was very deep and also very revealing. I was able to release a lot of past pains i have held on to without even realising i was doing so.
After the whole session, i felt lighter, lifted and a whole lot happier.
How long did that happy happy feeling last u may ask ???? I can happily say that it has been over 10 days now.... that happy happy still remains, i am still enjoying the benefits of the session, my outlook on many things also seems to have changed. I am able to laugh off what previously would have dragged me down.
Mr Komang Wardana.... Matur Suksama üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ
Thank you so so much for the guidance, the insight and most of all for helping me with the deep seated issues i was holding on to. Wishing you love, light and happiness always üôèüèΩ",I came here for healing. I did the full package and had the most amazing experience. I feel so much lighter after releasing all my trauma. Everyone was really warm and welcoming. It made it easy to relax. Highly recommend anyone who is looking to release any trauma to visit this place. Will be returning when I am next in Bali.
