I did not understand the concept of this place. It's spacious and offers nice hang out places and a large clean pool. I felt it was a bit overpriced, and the food was rather minimal.","The manager of eleven penida beach club is Australianising!!
Racism..
we ordered for a nachos and mentioned the waiter thrice that we need it vegetarian.
The dish was served and we noticed the unusual taste and came to know it was beef..
Nobody wants to take accountability, after 10mins the waiter walking here and there called the manager, he came with his not so pleasing attitude
I told him‚Äô we mentioned we want it veg many times, we can‚Äôt eat beef, we are Hindus and we consider it sacred‚Äô
He said a namesake me too, and without any gesture of apology, he moved back to the stage to sing pop to please the Australian tourist. As probably he thinks Indian rupees don‚Äôt work in Nusa penida.

Also about the food, the place is over rated as the pizza tasted 1.5/10.
Chocolate milkshake:2.5/10
And the price is high for the standard of food and service they deliver.

The positives are the music (of course aud people pleasing) lol, ambience amazing .
* the nachos wasn‚Äôt charged in the bill but without notice/ apology/intimation.
They made us feel like a reward and as though we were struggling to pay for it.","We were staying in the area and found this restaurant with good vibes so decided to give it a go. The staff there are absolutely friendly and fantastic. You'll also be able to watch a bit of sunset with is on the left side if you look out of the restaurant. The vibes here is amazing, with good musics and lighting. It's next to a beach, and also they got a swimming pool inside the club in case if you wanna keep it easier to tidy up.
However when it comes to food, the food are comparatively worse. We ordered a seafood spaghetti, and a beef wrap. (Originally we could like to have the salmon bruschetta but it's sold out)

The pasta was over salted, with cheese on top and tiny fish pieces that is not really fresh. With the beef wrap, it's basically a wrap with bolognese sauce. You can imagine the texture of the wrap is soft and oily with the tomato sauces. Again, this wrap is salty as well.

The vibes, the environment, the staffs here are amazing. Just cannot expect too much from the food they serve :( they probably serve good drinks here maybe","i love this place!!!!!!
qheken and hendra are so cool!!!!!!!!
definitely ill come again!
they have happy hour and good cocktails and service and live band!
i love local biz here!!!@

Service was excellent, friendly and prompt. It was an open air building with fans and very comfortable.","I came here twice and didn‚Äôt love the food. I had a burrito which I believe had baked beans in instead of the usual kidney bean. As a brit it‚Äôs safe to say I was very surprised to realise it was baked beans in my burrito. I also tried the local chicken noodle soup which was nice but didn‚Äôt have many noodles. The brownie and ice cream was nice but more of a chocolate cake rather than a brownie.

Decent hotel, pool is nice
What i disliked is the breakfast and the staff at restaurant.
They have very limited options for breakfast and being vegetarian and when options are even more less, they denied when i asked for more fruits. Even the fruits what they give you is just 2 pieces of watermelon and papaya.
Even milk they dont refill unless you ask for it.
Overall breakfast must be improved.","Very polite, helpful and hospitable staff. Pickup and drop was done on time and smoothly. Free refill of water from the restaurant, which minimizes plastic wastage. Pool is open 24/7, helped some folks in our group practice swimming before snorkeling out in the ocean. It is conveniently located from all the major tourist points, and so close to both the harbours.",I had an excellent stay. The property and rooms were very nice. The staff were very helpful. They provide bikes for rental too. They have 2 swimming pools one for kids and one for adults. It can be accessed any time.,"My recent stay at Arsi Santha Hotel was overall positive. Despite a few minor drawbacks, the property offers good value for the budget-conscious traveler. The low shower pressure was a slight inconvenience, and I was disappointed that they didn't provide port pickup as promised. However, what truly stood out was the exceptional service from the staff, particularly Rendra. His assistance and friendly demeanor made the stay truly enjoyable. Rendra's dedication and helpfulness were amazing, and they significantly enhanced my experience at the hotel. Overall, despite some room for improvement in certain areas, I would recommend Arsi Santha Hotel for its excellent staff and value for money."

The food was good (we had tuna and octopus satay), and the smoothie I ordered also.

However, having to pay 150K for the long chairs felt a bit too much considering we were having lunch there and consuming drinks. It‚Äôs not like we just wanted to lay there and enjoy the pool.

Overall, it was nice to have a swimming pool to stay in but the service was average and the price of the long chairs definitely not justified compared to other places we‚Äôve been to.

I wish we had continued a few more meters and went to 21 Beach Club‚Ä¶","Caution: The restaurant's menu is relatively pricey, considering the absence of gourmet options. Be mindful when dining here; in addition to the displayed prices, there's an extra 16% charge (10% for taxes and 6% for services) that is not explicitly mentioned. It's worth noting that this establishment appears geared towards tourists. While the food is satisfactory, a potential concern is that the rice isn't refrigerated, posing a risk of food intoxication.","Saved me when I had to wait a boat for 3 hours. Nice pool and clean toilets.

You can use normal chairs for free, but small sunbed was 150 000idr even though you bought food.

Small pool but enough for getting fresh","We had a very comfortable stay in Penida Dream. The room was furnished with nightstands and shelves and the AC was working perfectly fine. A good plus for the tea, coffe, kettle and water for personal use.

We had the breakfast included, so every morning we would receive what we had ordered the day before right on time. It was the perfect way to wake up!

We couldn‚Äôt enjoy the pool that much but it was a nice treat after a hot day around the island. The hosts are very welcoming and friendly.
I would recommend this place to anyone!",Incredible value for money ! Very nice rooms and optional breakfast delivered directly at the room. Would highly recommend if staying on Nusa Penida! 10 minutes away by foot from the main restaurants of the island

food is good. carbonara portion came bigger than expected; love that it came with bread! fried calamari and chicken burger was good too. will likely come back again to try another pasta","This cute little restaurant served us great food, we had the breakfasts which were presented really nicely and was very good. The price was super cheap as well! We were served by Gilda and she was always smiling and very welcoming. The place was clean and pleasant to sit in, although a bit hot. Overall great breakfast!!","We absolutely love this place. Live music, amazing stuff (we like our waitress Surya) and delicious food. The place had a vibe, quick service, beautiful comfy place. Definitely worth of trying ü§©",I went here for breakfast and it was amazing! Cappuccino and smoothie bowl were delicious. I‚Äôll probably come here the rest of the days i will be on Nusa Penida. Especially Gilda was very kind and came to check in so i didn‚Äôt have to wait if i wanted to ask for anything! You also have a beautiful view from upstairs!,"THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE!!! My husband and I found this little gem right off by the harbor. Food was amazing, service was 10/10. Dilla and Esa were both very welcoming, friendly, and recommended the traditional Indonesian coconut pancakes that were super tasty! Highly recommend checking this cozy cafe out :)"

Beautifully located with some amazing sunset views. However bathroom needs some scope of improvement  but overall an amazing experience. We requested for pickup & drop service and they helped without any additional charges. I am really thankful for the help.,"The location of the place is exceptional, in front of the beach and is well protected from the sun by a nice tree. All day long you can enjoy the sound of the waves.

Be aware that you can only swim during high tide (twice a day).

It is easier to reach the Bungalow walking on the beach.

Unfortunately we had a mouse in the room, which ate a part of a bag and managed to open a bag of very good cacao beans. The staff checked the room for the mouse and instead found an old condom below a piece of furniture, which confirmed my feeling that the cleaning of the bungalow was not sufficient.
We didn‚Äôt get any compensation for these misadventures, only the statement from the manager on WhatsApp that they will improve.

The slide door to the toilet broke down during the second day.

The last night there was a big cockroach in the room.

They don‚Äôt have water refill. Very sad as you find many bottles on the beach. The first day you get two bottles and then you have to pay for the new ones.

For breakfast we had the first day banana pancake which were very bad. Unfortunately the breakfast choice is difficult if you want to avoid egg or caffeine.
The second day we had soup ans fried noodles, which were much better than the pancakes.

Communication before the trip was good to book the ferry tickets, but during the stay the staff doesn‚Äôt make an effort. There are very nice, but not proactive.

I found the place over expensive for the offered quality.","Cute place that I feel doesnt deserve some of the mixed reviews below. Its a beautiful place and the staff is very kind. It feels like a mini paradise on the beach, you hear the waves at night from your room.

Only 2 criticism would be a) indeed the bathroom could be nicer / cleaner / newer b) to get there you need to cross the big mess that the neighbours houses are which contrast with how cute the place is","‚Ä¢directly in front of a beach

‚Ä¢cool vibes

‚Ä¢chilling & sleeping with the sound of ocean waves

‚Ä¢spacious & clean room(wifi provided)","We went with this location due to some good reviews - boy did we regret it! We didn‚Äôt have any check-in, when we arrived 1hr after checkin started. Room stunk of mold, received yellow stained towels, no support what so ever, and the bathrooms were in the conditions where you wanted to shower/walk with shoes and avoid bare feet. After asking for check/in information (wifi, breakfast info, and info for tours) we received a paper with password and no further information. We had to ask around to get inaccurate info, as we were first told breakfast started at 11, then 8, when it really started at 7am. We were given a scooter to use with an empty gas tank, and the service was just absolutely terrible. The only good things were: the AC, the sound of the waves and the breakfast staff (a lady). We cancelled the rest of our reservation, and booked somewhere else - best decision we made! We found a place that was superb, cheaper, with excellent service and location. Avoid this place - don‚Äôt be fooled by good reviews!"

The host was unbelievably helpful, offering reasonably priced scooters, helping plan our activities for the day (how long it takes to scoot to each beach ect) and was able to book our transport and snorkeling tours at a discount which were absolutely amazing.

The rooms are spacious, clean and amazing value with a comfy bed, good water pressure, balcony and AC.

The location is close to the main road, about a 5-minute walk down a dirt path that gets muddy when it rains and has no  lights. As with most of this island though renting a scooter was quite important to get around which made the dirt road not a problem.

Overall I highly recommend staying here, the host will really make sure you make the most of your time if you want to do activities. Definitely do the manta snorkeling tour and rent a scooter if you have prior experience on them!","I stayed in the bungalow for two nights.  My room was spacious and very clean, the AC and hot water worked great!
Kadek (hotel manager) took care of everything!  He made a great plan for my visit!
He recommended me places and times to visit all the viewpoints!  He even told me when I should put gas in my scooter!

I received better service than a 5 star hotel!  Highly recommend staying here!",You will feel like you‚Äôre part of the family as soon as you arrive! Kadek and his mom run a fabulous business together at an incredible price. The bungalows are clean and simple. You have everything you need available in your room to you. Breakfast is delicious and you‚Äôre in a perfect location‚Ä¶. Just a 5 minute walk to tons of restaurants and bars. Also about a 7 minute walk to the beach.,I really recommend staying in this place. The bungalows are pretty new and very confotable. The breakfast is delicious and the owner is just amazing. We decided to resign from snorkeling because of the weather but then in the morning changed our minds and he settle everything an hour before and gave  us a rider to the port for free. He also settle us a ticket to Gili and just gave js a rider for free. The best stay in Asia for 4 months.,"The host, Kadek,was so kind and friendly! He helped us with everything we needed. He booked a taxi from the harbour and he got us a great price for a private driver for when we visited Broken beach and Kelingking beach!

Kadek also helped us book our snorkelling trip in which we went to four different spots and saw mantas. He always looked out for us and went the extra mile to give us a great stay. Kadek‚Äôs mother and sister also helped and were super welcoming!
They drove us with scooter and the day we left Kadek‚Äôs mother served us breakfast before they opened so that we could eat before our travels.

If we come back to Nusa Penida we‚Äôll definitely stay here again! Definitely great service for a great price! Thank you for having us!

Best regards,

The beds were comfy and the bathroom had shower gel and shampoo. We were also able to hire a scooter for 75k a day and explore the island. There is also a hammock on the balcony outside and some bean bags if you want to relax.

There is a few restaurants and shops within walking distance and to the ATM as well.

We liked most of all that the staff were so helpful and friendly and were always available when we needed any advice! Thank you so so much and we would definitely recommend!","Convenient Location near Bajam nyuh Pier. Kadek is all smiles and very welcoming. Clean rooms, cold AC. Comfortable bed.

I really appreciated this, especially while already being stressed about my plans being derailed.

I didnt have hot water but it was so humid and warm so not a big deal. They serve yummy rice bowls and for the price i am very satisfied. Pillows have good support. Check with owner for # of power points if that's important to you.
