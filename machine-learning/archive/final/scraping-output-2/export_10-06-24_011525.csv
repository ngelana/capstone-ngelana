Kuta Sel., Kabupaten Badung, Bali 80363, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17211582050099337496,OPERATIONAL,+62 811-3804-793,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.5,130,,"Fell in love with this hotel,the service,the view right at the first time. I wish our second time to Bali had such a nice experience we got like we got it here at Jimbaran Cliff Hotel.

Very Helpful and nice staff, amazing infinity pool view, clean room, I love everything about this hotel. If there was a 6 star,I would give it 6 definitely.

Definitely worth every penny. I still remember how they welcomed us with warm welcoming, with amazing Balinese music and excellent service (at 12am or 1am in the morning, yes,you read in right ‚ù§, our flight to Bali arrived in midnight).

Sending love to Jimbaran Cliff Hotel team from America if you guys staff read this. Thank you the team so much for making our trip to Bali such a Never-Forget-Experience. ‚ù§‚ù§","Disappointing. Pictures and reviews were decent, but there is a lack of attention to details. My request for an airport pickup was never read, I had to call them after I got to Bali. Water is given in small 330ml plastic bottles and only 1 per person per day (yet the hotel claims to be concerned about the environment). The AC dripped into the bed. Outlets were not convenient for bedside charging. The kitchen is unusable, no gas tank and no pots and pans. When I asked the staff, they said that the kitchen is only available if you ask in advance (the OTA booking says there is a kitchen). My shower drain is positioned in such a way that water pools unattractively after you shower. The light over the sink buzzes and the faucets and sinks are set up in such a way that I've sprayed water all over myself multiple times. Food is expensive and mediocre. Luckily I'm on a work trip and barely spending time there. The only plus side is that the pool area and view is nice. Overall, overpriced and barely comfortable and I would not stay there again especially given the wealth of hotel options in Bali!","Beautiful and secluded location more suited for honeymooners. The deep soaking pool was amazing! Service was a hundred percent. Each villa has it's own private pool and I noticed a public pool area which needed attention. The downside is if you want amenities close by, you won't find much but there is a car from the villa if you need it.","A nice private hotel located on a cliff; however, it's quite far from the main street. There is a restaurant open 7am-11pm same as a reception desk. Hotel members are friendly and helpful. Good room facilities, beatiful bathroom area and spacious apartments. Outside private pool area is a lovely hidden place.",We stayed at this beautiful hotel 1 year ago and I still love it! The stay was amazing. The location is very beautiful with a big private pool (which is really private) with an amzing view!! The service was also amazing. Super friendly and supportive! I would love to come back someday!

Minor suggestion, it would be great if the WA reg form can be polished to look more professional, fix all typo and use effective words. It was a bit fishy tbh, but as i was not required to pay DP/Booking Fee i'd decided to just try and thankfully it is great.","Service is unfriendly and complicated. We got a car where the machine is shaking and noisy, but they claim it‚Äôs alright and just a rubber slip.

When we request for a change, they make it very complicated and demand us to go to the main office (even though we have arrived at the garage) to sort out some paperworks. Admin WA also forward us to three different people so it‚Äôs very hard to ask for assistance.

On the return day, they demand extra money because of scratches that were there beforehand. Also very rude.

Please pay attention to your service.","Price is good, car is good. But the service can be more friendly, hand over can be done more polite, pick up also rude just left in a rush fast speed without saying anything and we did not even have a chance to give tips since the pick up after work hour. Couple times missed communication and not complete information to customer.","Great service, eventhough the Whatsapp Admin less responsive but their service are reliable.

They wont give upgrade or clean subtitution.","They have some pros and cons:

Pros:
- Competitive price
- Fast response admin
- Detail to documented previous dents and scratches

Cons:
- Admins and drop-off staff were not able to coordinate properly. In my case they drop the car an hour earlier even though it was very clear that we agreed to meet at 7pm, had to rush and reschedule some plans because of this.
- On the return date, i was late for one hour than the booking time (7pm) but they charged 2hours late fee because of the miss-coordination they did themselves.
- Drop-off staff was also late for an hour, had to wait and paid him separate drop-off fees. So in total, i was late for just an hour from the booking time but i had to pay almost half the rent fees. I don‚Äôt mind to pay but its a disappointing experience.
- On top of that, the car was rented with empty tank (i even had to pay 100k in advance to the drop-off staff because they need to put some petrol on the car), but the when i put a full tank on it (which cost 400k) they refused to compensate it at all. I understand its not really their fault (i should‚Äôve known better) but it would‚Äôve been nice for them to do so, as they rented it with a completely empty tank and required us to pay petrol in advance. Which i never experienced in any other car rental company.","- drop off staff is not contactable after the landing time, even though we‚Äôre still waiting for luggage but we still want to hear an info right?
- the free pickup location is at the airport, but the drop off staff was ASKED for their transport fee (Gojek fare). When we asked the admin, the admin literally said ‚Äòseikhlasnya aja‚Äô. Quite different?
- the car booked was ‚ÄòNew Brio Matic‚Äô but the Brio comes was from 2019 and the car is so meeeehhhh. The indicator somehow not working (the fuel status, sometimes the hand break indicator, and the transmission). Which VERY IMPORTANT indicator.
- the admin is NOT HELPFUL AND NOT POLITE AT ALL.
- NEVER EVER booked in this rent again near the future.","The experience was really bad. The staff and car quality were really bad.

Some indicators on the car were broken :
- fuel indicator not updating even though I already fill it up twice,
- air bag indicator always on
- and the accelerator pedal not responsive and causing car going backwards when I stop at ascending road (even not steep)

The staff and admin are rude when we are complaining about the service.

Really really not recommended.","Very bad service and not recommended to rent a car here.
I wanted to rent, I was asked for a booking fee first, but when we arrived, the car was different from what we order.

They were more than 1 hour late in delivering the car, disrupting our schedule.
After arriving, the back door of the car could not be opened, there were many scratches and dents on the car body.
The rear AC is hot.

When we asked why the car didn't match our order, the officer who delivered the car said that the car was still being used by the car owner.
It is very strange to rent out a car where the booking fee has been paid, but the car is still being used by the owner.

When we complained to the admin who we were coordinating for the rental, the admin actually said that the client wasn't just me, if I want to cancel, please cancel.
Very unprofessional.
Very bad service."
