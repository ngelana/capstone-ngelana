All of the staff gave me great service, and the room was prepared very well. I liked the nighttime vibe at the cafe, it gave me a relaxed and chill dinner with live music and the shimmering sound of the sea waves. I think it deserves to be the best resort on Nusa Penida.

As we opened the door to our room, we were greeted by the mesmerizing sight of the beach stretching out before us. Waking up to the sight of the sunrise over the ocean was truly breathtaking.

The room itself was cozy and comfortable, with all the amenities we needed for a relaxing stay. What's more, it was incredibly affordable, making it one of the best value-for-money accommodations we've experienced.

One of the highlights of our stay was the opportunity to go snorkeling just steps away from the hotel. The staff were incredibly helpful in arranging our excursion, even providing transportation to and from the snorkeling site.

While the dinner options at the hotel were just okay, we thoroughly enjoyed trying the local seafood. However, breakfast served to us in our room was a true indulgence, allowing us to savor delicious food while taking in the stunning beach views from our patio.

The staff at were attentive and accommodating throughout our stay. They even allowed us to store our luggage and use the hotel's facilities after we checked out, making our departure as smooth as our arrival.","This hotel has a fantastic location, right next to the sea. You can walk out of your room and be in the ocean in less than a minute. We rented snorkeling equipment from the front desk and explored the ocean outside the hotel. The Blue Harbor also has a decent bar and restaurant, and the best hotel breakfast we had on this trip. Only downside was our room had a view of a concrete wall rather than the ocean.","Of all the nice things about Penida, staying at Blue Harbor was the best part of our 2 days on the island. The team ( Special thanks to Ms. Ernie) took excellent care of us right from booking -she was kind enough to help arrange the pick up and drop to the harbor, recommend us the best Scuba diving folks as well as during the entire stay. The food, the room service, the view from the hotel, everything was top notch. Breakfast is a la carte to choose from limited options, but the restaurant is great for eating on a daily basis as well. Our stay here would be one of the best parts of our Bali trip- with beautiful sunrise and sunsets as icing on the cake. We even got to spot dolphins.","I wish I could have stayed longer! Amazing snorkeling right outside your bungalow. I swam with a turtle just within ten minutes of swimming. Beautiful traditional Bali wooden architecture, with soft beds and comfortable a/c. Two pools one small and one even smaller. Attentive staff and delicious food drinks. Highly recommend.",A wonderful place with an amazing beach view and very good service. The food is delicious too. The only problem was that the shower water was salt water but otherwise everything was perfect.

The food is one of the best in Penida! The pho did taste a little inferior compared to our favorite MeVui in Sanur. The manager explained that it's difficult to make beef stock in the more limited-resources Penida, so they have to use chicken broth instead (that's been clearly stated in the menu). Still, it's so good slurping a good warm of soup right after snorkeling! That's pho sure!","had a delightful dining experience ordering the hu tiu, nem nuong and tea. Everything was incredibly delicious, and I'll definitely be back again. The service was also very friendly and he can speak fluent Vietnamese with South accent. Thank you for serving us.","Yay me vui is always a good idea, glad to have it at Nusa Penida, so close from my hotel. Good food at night and have very relaxing atmosphere here. Hope me vui open earlier at 10am for breakfast. And one thing i just concern about the dogs around the beach. To make visitors more comfortable I think that would be better if you guys have permanent or wood partition outside (see one of my photos with wood partition). I'm happy eat here and see the dogs but they looks like hoping we give them eat too üòÑ","Amazing location on the beach.
They have WiFi.
The king size pho is really big and filling. The iced tea and squash drink are amazing too.
Their bathroom was clean.
Their decor and aesthetic are amazing.
Their menu is fun to read as it has info about the history of the food and some vocab to learn.
They have like 6  locations.
A mandatory 16% of the bill is charged for tax and service.","I came here to fulfill my craving for Vietnamese coffee and rice paper rolls. The rice paper rolls are nothing too special but the sauce they use deserves a shout-out, that tasted amazing. The rolls were a little tangy and could have been soaked a little better before wrapping. The coffee on the other hand was the worst Vietnamese coffee I've  had. Then again, I decided to go for Vietnamese cuisine in Indonesia. The service is one of the best in the island and I definitely recommend trying this restaurant, but maybe sticking to the cold drinks and the cooked foods!"

We had an unforgettable stay at The Mambo Hills Resort in Nusa Penida! We stayed for three nights, and the room was absolutely amazing‚Äîspacious, clean, and with stunning views. The staff were incredibly attentive and friendly, especially ‚ÄúG-Day,‚Äù who made our stay extra special.

The resort is the perfect place to relax and unwind. It's quiet and serene, providing the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle. Each night, we would head down to the Mambo Dive Resort where we enjoyed live music and a fantastic happy hour from 4pm to 6pm.

The highlight of our trip was the snorkelling excursion. The host ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù explained everything from safety to the best snorkelling spots, and his beautiful wife even made the delicious lunch we had on our return. We spent over five hours exploring two different sites and were lucky enough to see loads of manta rays. The underwater scenery was breathtakingly beautiful.

Overall, our stay was absolutely unreal. We can't recommend The Mambo Hills Resort and Mambo Dive Resort enough. If you're looking for a combination of relaxation and adventure in Nusa Penida, this is the place to be!","Had the best experience doing the refresher course with Uys, and diving PEG and Blue Garden with Uys and Phil! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more professional and fun team! Equipment is in great condition and I had no safety concerns at all. Both dive sites were absolutely beautiful, we saw 12 turtles in less than 45 minutes!!! Would highly recommend Mambo for both new and experienced divers :)","I did the open water course, and it was overall okay. I think the experience will really depend on the instructor you get.

I was the only student in the course and I definitely benefited from a private lesson paying a group session cost. But my instructor‚Äôs mood sort of shifted drastically from the first two days which left me quite puzzled (maybe he was having a bad day, which is human and normal) and this affected the last day‚Äôs experience and my overall memory of the open water course unfortunately. I feel like we rushed through some things, moving on to the next part as quickly as possible - to be fair there‚Äôs a lot to cover but it felt a bit rushed. Of course I did ask questions in between but it heavily relied on me stopping him if I didn‚Äôt get something. Overall it also made me wonder whether he was putting his 100% because I was the only student in the course. The first two days he definitely brought a fun atmosphere and I appreciated it. It‚Äôs not his responsibility to entertain me as we‚Äôre doing a course not a fun dive but his attitude and approach did affect my comfort and confidence level especially since I was a bit nervous.

The dive center operations team was very helpful and flexible with the dates and answered all my questions on WhatsApp. Thank you! The lunches were simple and delicious. ü§§

They give you a little something if you leave a review - that‚Äôs why they have so many reviews! (It‚Äôs a smart strategy) I think the dive center lives up to its rating more or less.","Did my open water course here, the dive team is amazing. I fell sea sick during one of  my dives the dive team was very considerate and halted on the beach to make sure I‚Äôm okay. The training is very professional and you‚Äôll learn a lot from the instructors here. The location is on the beach and is just so damn beautiful. Big shout out to our dive instructor Aldo!!",Stayed at Mambo for 4 nights and had a great day diving consisting of 3 dives. Great set up with lots of quality equipment right on the beach. So easy to walk straight  on/off the dive boat on the beach! The boats are really modern and clean. Recommend!

It has been a great experience to dive with them. They have great facilities on their shop, well maintenance dive gears, and wonderful team.

Cut was my guide during my diving session with Blue Corner. My experiences of being guided by her were awesome. She‚Äôs such a cool, fun, and helpful DM. She is genuinely happy when her guests are happy.

I also brought my friends to try discovery scuba diving. The team took time to let my friends be comfortable being underwater during the pool sessions.  The experience was so good they are now falling in love with scuba dive.","Dived with a group of friends January 2024 with blue corner. A fun and friendly company that has experienced professional guides where safety is paramount. We generally had a guide per 3 Divers. Nusa penida diving is a treat, we went to a great variety of really healthy reefs with sealife galore. They even managed to find us a sunfish on my birthday. I cannot recommend more highly. Thanks to Jason, Etienne and Chuc for making our holiday.","The guys that run the place are probably the nicest that I‚Äôve ever come across! Made me feel very welcomed and did their best to ensure that we had an enjoyable experience. Although we were super unlucky to not see the mantas diving (similar to every other diving centre on the day), the team did a great job by looping round the boat to another area where we were able to snorkel with a manta! We were the only diving centre to do this. Shows that they truly care about providing the best experience!","I had contacted Blue Corner dive through WhatsApp, and was so excited to dive at manta point.
I was not disappointed. Jason, Magnus, and the team at blue corner dive were incredible.
They made a point to explain that mantas don‚Äôt like people coming from above, and how to respect the mantas by not chasing them and observing.
It was incredible experience, and one I won‚Äôt forget (thanks to a certain titan triggerfish).
If you‚Äôre going to nusa penida, the team at blue corner dive will treat you and the animals with utmost respect.
I felt very welcomed and supported here.
Thanks again ü©µ","First time diving and this place is definitely a good choice. Instructor Cud was so nice and professional that I could totally trust my life within her hand.All three dives were gorgeous, numerous mantas encountered, corals were beautiful, fishes were amazing. All in all 10/10 experience ."

Overall I do not recommend anyone to stay here.","Very bad experience, we had check in at 2 p.m. and they canceled it half an hour before entering, we had reserved it a month in advance and they canceled it because they rented it to people who came in that day and since we had 3 rooms reserved, it deserved them but it is worth renting it to other people at double the price, I do not recommend it, unless you want to be left without accommodation, I recommend Tentacle Bali cottage (better quality), since they solved the problem for us and charged us the same, when they We tell about our mishap with the other accommodations","I had a great experience staying here. The staff was lovely, the WiFi and AC were reliable and the beach access couldn‚Äôt have been better. Easy access to good restaurants and Legend, the best dive operator on the island. Highly recommended.","Honestly the only good things about this place were the view of the beach (as soon as you step in the water be careful you don‚Äôt hurt yourself on the corral that covers the ground), the price and the puppies (which will bark all night long). The rooms are pretty gross, I know it‚Äôs cheap but that doesn‚Äôt mean I want brown water in the sink that never clears up or water that never actually drains on the bathroom floor. There were cobwebs all over the ceiling of the room and definitely mice wandering around as you try to sleep through the dogs barking all night. There was also no toilet paper in the room as well as used shampoo and soap in the bathroom.

But here's our experience:

We headed in at night and there was a lady who helped us to our bedroom. The lights inside were extremely dim, with 3 mildly lit lights, with 1 light not working. Plugs didnt work with our chargers as well, we believed it was damaged. My dad headed in the showers first while i rested, and once i entered, i saw a dead cockroach. Pretty flat, can tell it isn't a freshly dead one, so i assume they didn't clean the rooms before leasing it to us.

Once I'm out, my father then told me not to open the cabinet as the inside were filled with dust, as well as dead cockroaches. We decided to stay despite that, but we didn't last 20minutes as he dropped his mini flashlight behind the bed, and while he went to look for it it's full of dust behind. Overall the whole room is dusty and musky, and we were pretty drained so we decided to book another resort. I'd say pay for another 1.5x of the price to stay here, you can easily find another at a better location and definitely bright and lit.

Things that can definitely improve from here:
1. The doors should work to be locked properly.
2. Lights to be fixed and slightly brighter.
3. Clean out the room before the next guests come.

I strongly believe as reviews states that the owner and his wife is nice and helpful, however upon reaching and settling, we did actually head out to look for help from them but they were nowhere to be found, which resulted in us just leaving the place completely. We understand that having your own property and wanting people to live around may be a nice and enjoyable moment, but we found ourselves not enjoying at all with the unkempt room, with no one all around us, and only darkness. We may be at the area at the wrong time to have no one around even the host though. But sad to say we will never book this place the next trip.","A magnificent place!
If you‚Äôre looking for a 5* resort, this is not your place‚Ä¶but if you love being surrounded by nature, if you enjoy the sound of birds, geckos, crickets‚Ä¶this ia definitely a great place to stay in!

The location is amazing, close to beach clubs and restaurants.
You can rent a scooter directly from there and visit the whole island.
Gede and his wife are extremely nice, helpful and friendly hosts! They are always smiling, always trying to make you feel good.

Overall, for me it was a great experience, and I would definitely stay here again if returning on Nusa Penida.","Nice pool, good bedroom and lighting. Make sure you mind the offerings above the door.
Water pressure to water heater not enough. No place to hang clothes in bathroom.","We had a really lovely stay here. The bungalows are away enough from the main street to be very peaceful day and night, but close enough by foot even to delicious nearby resort restaurants. The room was spacious and clean; beautiful garden in front with mangoes and coconut trees supplying our breakfasts üòã also nice to sit on the terrace to birdwatch! Gede and Madi were very helpful and nice people to talk to! Overall an authentic experience.","Had a great stay here, roomy bungalows, clean and the beds were very comfy. Away from the main road but still close to the beach. Gede and Madi were very friendly and helpful, showed how to open a fresh coconut and made great pancakes."

The rooms are quite nice. Despite is near the road the wall protect well from the sound.
I‚Äôve explore the coast and on this part this was the most simple and best hotel I could choose.
All the cabana are front beach/sea and the owner build it far from the shore and that‚Äôs why is one of the few with a nice and clean beach. Most of the others are constructed beaches or there‚Äôs no beach at all.
The owner is very chill and friendly always available to help. Including a bike to rent.
The breakfast is quite simple but with the necessary things (not luxury‚Äôs).
A wonderfull experience and I  truly desire that the owner can develop and make the hotel bigger and sucessfull.","One of the most beautiful places we have stayed. Right next to the beach. We stayed in the Pool Villa. Rooms were very neat, bathrooms especially. The Owner of the property Mr Aga, a very helpfull person. He gave us lot of suggestions.Always there for you. Have to say he Has maintained the beach right in front of the property very well. Very clean. It was like a private beach. You can also snorkel from there. Mr Aga also arranged day trip for us and scooter rental.
Breakfast was nice, simple and well arranged. Right in front of the beach. The freshly squeezed orange juice is da highlight.
Will miss this property in Nusa Penida.
The property is also very close to the nusa pendia port.","Wayan,
Is a fabulous host. He is so helpful. The Korean restaurant he recommended is delicious.
The rooms are great and right on the beach.","Very comfortable stay, owner is a really kind and accommodating person. The view waking up is amazing.

Could not ask for anything more with this hotel.","Host is very friendly and helpful. Awesome ocean view! But the Villa just beside the main road, so it‚Äôs very noisy, we encountered power cut like once per day, hot water doesn‚Äôt enough for shower. But it‚Äôs still valuable for stay."

Like in other reviews, the music is pretty loud, but stops around 10 - 11 pm which works for us.

Booked through Expedia and it was a confirmed  booking but when I arrived at the property the property owner told us that Adi Bunglow is overbooked. I have to move along and check at-least three properties with the owner for spare rooms so that we can check in. It was a great inconvenience and waste of time. After two hours we were given two rooms at a different nearby property Ulu Artha which was one of the worst stays I ever had so far in Bali. Book this place at your own risk.,"I very much recommend stay here as we enjoyed ours. The place is lovely, the bed comfortable, there is beautiful garden with colorful flowers, mango, coconut and papaya trees which adds to the good vibe. Adi is very helpful, he organized everything for us, the speed boat from Bali, scooter rental, snorkeling trip, which made our stay that much more comfortable. Best wishes from us Adi!"
