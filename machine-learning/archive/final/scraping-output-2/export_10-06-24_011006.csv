Option of self service also. Plenty of space to chill.","Pork steak is ok, beef tenderloin steak could be good, but it came in raw. We've cut the meat but the plate is not hot enough to cook it properly. It was disgusting that the blood was coming out from the meat.","PeTo (Pitu = 7)
This place is extraordinary. They have 3 kind of service, self service half service and total service. I choose the self service and it's a good experience for me.
This steakhouse over some 'rare' menu, because I rarely found the menu at the other steakhouse. The price is various depends on the menu.

And I gave rating now, because I don't want other people had same experience like me.

Staying here definitely not worth it, unless they had full renovation and change the staffs.

The room was completely dirty.
There was some hair and footprints on the floor, blood stain on the bed, leaking water from the tap, room smells smoke and the walll was moldy.

We request to change room, but the other room was not better. Still dirty and not well maintained.

When we want to ask, are there better room instead of this one, the receptionist go home, because she said her shift was over.
So we have to wait for 10 minutes, for another staff coming.

After the next shift staff coming, we have to explain our problem again. Since the previous shift tell her nothing.

Then they offer us another room but this time with 'upgrade' because this room was twice the price, but we don't need to pay a cent.

When we look at the room, we are some kind of relieved, because this room was far better from the first and second one, but unfortunately this room was not cleaned yet.
Since this room was not used for a long time, so they have to change the sheet, fix the air conditioner, and some cleaning here and there.
And it takes 2 hrs minimum to clean all of it.

Finally, we decided to cancel the book, but the receptionist can't help with the refund.
And so we leave with disappointment and book another hotel near Sanur.

Although we can't refund, but I don't really mind. because the stay will not be worth it.

Worst experience ever.",Ok,,,

Price is very high compared to the dirty place you get.
Do not expect hospitality.

They just rent out the space, cleanliness is excluded, UNLESS you complain, they will clean up (but not clean enough).

You need to always ask for basic cleanliness, it was a messy management, I do hope the owner is taking care of the place in the future.
Rust is everywhere on every water tap (I did not use the sink in the bathroom at all, not even to wash my hands), they cleaned the sink after few days after I complained loudly for 3 days straight upon arriving (otherwise they do not care at all), but still not clean enough.
The water kettle was also rusty, the inside part was black, and they cleaned it after I complained for 1 week.
I don't think they ever clean the curtains, probably since years ago.

Complaint must be addressed to the cleaner, to the marketing lady, to the management - yes there were 3 persons whom I need to contact - super draining. And there was none to take care about how the guests are feeling, because I tried to negotiate few times about the price I paid, the marketing lady was telling me ""it's fixed price"" and it will be more draining for me to ask for refund/ any discount due to unpleasant stay, because those 3 persons are not a decision maker.

Additionally, the cleaner do not know how to clean.
Even if I precisely mentioned what to be cleaned (it was written by WhatsApp point by point), they asked me ""is this clean enough"", well it is not but it's not my job to tell them how to clean, or... they forgot to clean, so basically they don't know what they don't know.

The only thing that made me stay is the space, the studio is spacious enough. But it took me almost 10 days out of the place during 1 month stay, and if I had more money I would check out earlier as I could not sleep most days, the location is noisy during day time (I think there was a local warehouse doing renovation all day long including saturdays in the back of rooms) and also during night time there was a loud noise from cafe around, until 2-3 AM.

Search for somewhere else to stay, save your money.",I love it here and the family is very nice. Very clean rooms also and the two Pomeranians are so cute.,"Huge room, more than expected. so comfy and has private parking lot.",,
