The spot is fantastic. It‚Äôs really refreshing.
I think they should have kind of attractive things to do. Not only for the photo spots.
Offering some breakfast menu‚Äôs will be profitable for the business. Not only asking for entry tickets.
I was wondering if they give me the breakfast menu at that time, unfortunately having no explanation at all about the place.
Hope they can growing up till my next visit. ü§û","A beautifully laid out place from where you could quietly sit & watch the spectacle unfold with the comfort of a hot cup of coffee and/or a simple breakfast ‚Äì minus the hundreds of tourists around you clamoring for selfies. It also has a view of Mt. Batur to boot, which ironically is not possible if you are on the summit.","Really nice spot for a cool drink and fantastic views staff a really nice people üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
$4 to get in nice cold drinks I brought a beer, bottle of Coke and baskets $8","Beautiful place for sunrise. Amazing view.
You can rent a tent here for sunrise camp with friends or family.
They provide a tent, sleeping bag with matras. Don‚Äôt worry about toilet, it‚Äôs very clean. They also have a local menu for breakfast. Coffee, fried rice and snack.
Very recommended for your best sunrise experience.","pinggan village is a village located in Kintamani in the Mount Batur area, in this village we can see very beautiful mountain views and beautiful sunrises with fog, there we can take pictures on the edge of the cliff, camping and for refreshing, there are equipped with facilities gazebo, toilet and parking area, access to get there can be by car and motorbike, the entrance ticket price is only 10 thousand per person"

overall the location is excellent, but they need take better care of it. there was still some trash and dog mess around the camp ground plus the lighting need to be fixed. the lights on every footpath and campground should be checked again because from my experience, it was quite difficult to walk on night time due to minimal lighting. the staff were very helpful with loading rented stuff into the campground area, but there's still a lot of room for improvement in their hospitality. when we asked why the lights in the campground were off, they didn't suggest any solutions or explain the cause and when we arrived we also struggled to find staff for the check in process. for those planning to shower in this area, there are only 2 toilets available, so please be patient. the hot water facilities are a big help, but please, cleanliness of the toilets really needs attention.

it‚Äôs such a shame if a place with such great potential isn't maintained well and doesn't step up its hospitality. you can bring your own tent or rent with them. all camp ground from A to D offer awesome views, and the location is pretty clear and easy to find. If you're planning to camp here, just make sure you're well prepared for your personal need and keep in touch with the whatsapp admin spesifically during your arrival! ü§ó","Honestly, this spot's awesome for camping fans. However, everyone's blasting music and the constant smoke from all the bonfires gets on your nerves. It's like each tent has its own little inferno and people can't seem to keep their voices down.

The bathroom situation's not great either, and don't even get me started on the mini kitchen ‚Äì definitely could use a scrub.","Went there with campervan for the first time and had quite good experience. We were lucky not to bump with lots of people at the time, so the limited space still feels spacious and the spot we parked in has electrical socket. The only thing that needs improvement was the bathroom since there was only one to accomodate all campers","If you like outdoor camping, don't miss the breathtaking sunrise view overlooking mount Batur Kintamani. You can bring your own tent and rent it from them",A good campground with a nice view over mt. Batur. There is a building with shower and toilet on the campsite. No food available so bring your own.
