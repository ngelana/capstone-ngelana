You get almost 3 hrs of fun on the downstream river. Don't book any tour packages. Hire a bike and reach this location. Don't shy away to ask a discount. We got it for 1.5 mil for 2 PPL including zip line. You may get a better price as well.,"The adventure is wonderful and the route is very nice, helmets and life jackets, paddles
Shall be Renewed as it start being in weak condition.
The local guides are professional in their work.
After finishing the adventure you get a lunch in the end.","Good experience with BMW Rafting.
Guides are hardworking and definitely skilled in rafting.

Not as physically demanding as I anticipated. I was only required to do a little bit of paddling at the start but the guide does everything for the rest of the trip.

The view along the river is amazing and our guide was kind to tell us the names of plants that we were curious about. Water does smell a little but is tolerable.

Be sure to put on sunscreen or cover up (even if its a cloudy day) as we were noticeably more tan afterwards!

Shower and towels are provided at the end point. Buffet is also decent.

Start and end points are different. They provide service where they move your car for you.","It was a good experience our rafting with BMW Rafting.
Our guide was great.
The rafting take place along the Telaga Waja river, it is not an extreme experience but an exciting one.
While rafting on the Telaga Waja river we enjoyed the beauty of the nature: waterfalls, cliffs, the jungle‚Ä¶
It takes about 2 hours from start to end.
At the end of the rafting we had a lunch buffet that was included in the price but it was nothing special.
After the rafting it is possible to take a shower, I suggest to have flip flops for your hygiene, towels are provided.
(Visited in March 2023)","18km of white water rafting.  Water level was lower when we went. Still provided a very fun 2.5hours of experience at a very reasonable pricing.  The service, guide, and the free buffet afterward were excellent.  I would definitely take the kids to visit again next time we are in Bali."

It ended up with a super extraordinary experience. You would run into bomboo and need to lie down. You have two four meters jumps, go through a small waterfall. We saw monkeys on the way As well. It definitely wothy to Do it. The staff is great and the restaurant with great view in the end is one of the best part as well.","Thank you for such a fun and adventurous day! ü•≥ All Avatar guides were super professional and helpful!
