The peaceful atmosphere and relatively untouched nature of the beach provide a serene escape from the crowds. One of the highlights of Pantai Kelecung is the magnificent sunsets. The facilities at Pantai Kelecung are limited, so it's advisable to bring your own food, drinks, and beach essentials. Also, be mindful of the currents and take necessary precautions when swimming","A beautiful & calming black sand beach, the beach is wide enough and empty of visitors.  Access to the location is smooth, unfortunately many stalls were closed so it was difficult to find food there","Remote volcanic beach at the end of the Kelecung village. It looks like the beach from the Goonies movie üòÅ. Indeed it's a turtle egg incubation area and the ""relict"" of a 6 stars resort (it was abandoned just recently) is still visible, for those who love ""architecturology""","Black sanded beach
Peaceful place with only a few people coming, all areas are clean, there's some warung open there so if you need food you can buy it there
For the photo, it is a great place to explore","Really amazing place, away from the turist and perfect for sunset."

The View is stunning, you can see the beach from the terrace above the lovely separate kitchen building. The Place at all is very modern and stylish and the balinese style still is present in simple elegance and you have a precious beautiful temple in the garden. It is clean, the landlord really cares about the appearance of the property. He and his family are very nice and there have been good conversations, support and understanding of my needs. Even everybody in the Village and around have been absolutely kind to me and supporting, trying to make conversation and invite me over to let me take part in their life. Kelecung is a great location. It is best located and close to Canggu and Tabanan ( ca. 30 mins) and still tranquille and not crowded (yet). From the House you can reach the Ocean by scooter within 5 Minutes, where one of your direct neighbours owns a cool Beach Bar with very nice cocktails, you shouldn¬¥t miss out, cause Wayan Yudits Cocktails are incredibly good and more than affortable. The Beach is a dream beach in black, but has rough waves and is beautiful. Actually there are two beaches, another hidden one, which is more calm also. Another 10 Minutes to the opposite direction in the Center of Kelecung you have some little Warungs and I really want to recommend you to Visit the biggest one, you will surely find it. Warung Wayan Wishnu. Sri, Wayans wife has amazing cooking skills and Wayan is the most friendliest, funniest person, with a solution for all problems and answers to all questions you might have about Bali. Also he knows a lot of Drivers who can take you around, but if you want to rent a scooter or car you can directly turn to your landlord Wayan Erna, who runs a car and scooter rental in Kuta and will give you very good conditioned vehicles to a good price, directly put into your gerage - which is also there for you to use!
I stayed there happily with my adopted dog Samudra, cause fortunally Wayan Erna is an animal lover too, he owns two dogs himself. I would like to highly recommend you the place - short or longterm - it will more than fulfill your needs and give you a pleasant stay! I come from Germany, for now i sadly leave here, but when I return to Bali, I will return to Kelecung for sure! Special thanks to Wayan Erna, his family and Yuni from me and Samudra, for the nice time we were able to spend at this place and with you!
