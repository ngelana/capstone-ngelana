Highlight of this place was the place itself. It reminds me of myself building a place in The Sims game with money cheat. Huge renaissance style paintings, huge statues, high ceilings. I used to throw all of the expensive decorations in the place and this place is like the real life of my The Sims houses back then. The music also loud.

I‚Äôm sure this place built with all the best intentions, it just doesn‚Äôt doing it for me.

Another note was the restroom which sadly was not built extravagantly like my The Sims builds. It can be a little bit more cleaner, brighter and better air circulations those will help the place tremendously.

I‚Äôd still recommend people to visit tho, just for them to experience my The Sims-like decorations in real life.","We decided to look for a new place to try and I found this place on google map.

The venue was huge and spacious. With kitsch and over the top decor which sort of eye catchy and made the place looked ""different"".

As usual people flock to brand new place in denpasar so expect difficulties of getting a seat. Car park also difficult, better ride motorbike.

What we order :

Mie Ayam, not that good.  But it's according to my friend so I can't explain..

Nasi mala, breaded chicken a bit too dry and salty for my taste.
Portion is small. But enough for female.

Siomay is 3 pcs small size siomay. Decent taste but considering the price... not in a good balance.

Kulit tahu. Surprisingly decent filling. But kinda oily.  Should be strained more, but it came super late so can't be helped.

Kaya toast, unlike the picture on the menu, it's thin toasted bread, barely taste the kaya jam. I got better kaya toast at Chinese warung at dalung area  for less the price . So this kaya toast is a letdown.

Staff seems to be overwhelmed and lack of direction. Our dumplings came super late. It supposed to be appettizer, not dessert.
Management, pls do better.

I'd say the level of food in this place similar to mie gacoan but a bit more expensive and have Singapore peranakan food gimmick."

I have only good things to say about Gurita Playground, and we will certainly go there again.
One downside is that there are timelimits on the visits, meaning you pay for a certain period of time whereas other similar places usually pay once and the child(ren) can play until they are finished and tired.
Other than that, we had very positive experience at Gurita Playground and i have no issues in recommending this playground for your child, children. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her time there, and we have visited several times.

Is your child bored or need to meet other kids Gurita Playground provide that and take care of your needs while waiting as your child plays.
