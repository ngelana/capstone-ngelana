You will be well looked after, nothing is too much trouble. The food was delicious and plentiful. It is remote but who cares! A short taxi ride into Ubud for the shops. We would definitely return for the relaxation.",Amazing place for a honeymoon. Very personable staff and they went above and beyond to tailor the stay to our liking. The honeymoon package was worth it and the little touches such as all the staff remembering our names was very much noticed and appreciated. I would definitely recommend the honeymoon package to anyone looking for a romantic getaway.,"My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary, and I can safely say it was one of the best resorts I've ever stayed at. It's beautiful, quiet and secluded - absolutely prfect for a romantic getaway. We booked the princess suite and if was amazing.

You will not regret booking it.",The jungle setting of this resort is beautiful and the staff are so nice. The food at the restaurant is top notch. The hotel is about half an hour from the centre of Ubud but we utilised the free shuttle to get in to town which was easy. Our room was at the bottom of the resort so we caught a shuttle up to the lobby but this was easy to arrange.,"Can't say enough positive about my experience here.  Beautiful grounds, excellent service, super clean.  Meals, spa, room, pools, everything was 5-star."

Having stayed at other five-star resorts in Bali, I must say that the staff here stands out with their exceptional attitude. They provided us with a personal assistant, which adds significant value compared to other resorts in the same class. Zara, our personal assistant, was wonderful and took excellent care of us throughout our stay.

The estate features a magnificent spring pool, which I absolutely loved, and the other facilities are equally clean and well-maintained. The highlight of my stay was the food—it was incredibly delicious and unforgettable.

The only minor drawback was the absence of a bidet in our toilet. Apart from that, everything was perfect.","We went to COMO Shambhala Estate in Bali for our Honeymoon and it was the one of the best hospitality experiences I have ever had. The staff predicted our every move and everyone knew our names. I am now going to seek out other COMO's in other location. The Spa was amazing, the food was top notch and the service was a new standard in hospitality and tourism.","An unforgettable Honeymoon Experience at Como Shambhala Estate! Do yourself a favor, treat yourself, and stay here.

Last year celebrated our honeymoon at the Como Shambhala Estate in Ubud, and it was nothing short of a dream come true. From the moment we arrived, we were enveloped in a world of serene beauty and unparalleled hospitality.

The resort itself is a masterpiece of natural elegance, seamlessly blending into the lush Balinese landscape. Wandering through the trails, we were enchanted by the sights and sounds of the waterfalls - a true testament to nature's artistry. The ambiance of tranquility and peace is something that we still carry with us.

The spa at Como Shambhala Estate is a haven of rejuvenation. Each treatment we experienced was tailored to our needs, leaving us feeling revitalized and pampered. The skill and care of the therapists are commendable and contributed greatly to our overall wellness during our stay.

A highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the culinary experience. The food was simply out of this world - a delightful journey of flavors, with dishes prepared with the freshest local ingredients. Every meal was a celebration of Balinese cuisine, crafted to perfection.

The wellness activities provided were top-notch, offering a perfect blend of relaxation and invigoration. Each session, whether it was yoga or meditation, was a unique experience, deeply connecting us to the serene environment of Ubud.

Above all, the staff at Como Shambhala Estate deserves the highest praise. Their attentiveness, warmth, and professionalism made us feel like royalty. Every request was met with a smile, and their efforts to make our honeymoon special were truly heartwarming.

In conclusion, our stay was an experience we will treasure forever. It is a sanctuary of bliss and an epitome of luxury in the heart of Bali. We are already dreaming of our next visit, and we cannot recommend this resort highly enough to anyone seeking a slice of paradise for a special occasion or a peaceful retreat.

Thank you, Como Shambhala Estate, for making our honeymoon an unforgettable journey of love and serenity.","The breakfast place is so magical, I used AI to generate the below description. Experience this for yourself when you stay here:

The rain came and went, leaving behind a forest sighing with mist, its breath painting the landscape with enchantment. In the background, the lilting melodies of traditional Balinese music gently filled the air, merging with the rain's soft patter on lush foliage. The fragrance of rain-soaked flowers added a subtle sweetness to the atmosphere, complementing the earthy scents of the forest.

As dawn broke, birds serenaded the new day, their songs echoing the rain's departure and ushering in a sense of renewed hope. This was more than a mere forest; it was a sanctuary of peace and serenity, a magical retreat from the frenetic pace of the outside world.

In this secluded haven, soft conversations flowed like a gentle stream. Waitresses, with soothing voices, engaged lone travelers, weaving threads of connection and camaraderie, transforming the space into a comforting abode for healing souls.

Amidst this tranquil setting, the soft roaring of the Ayung River added a powerful yet soothing presence. Standing near the ledge of the restaurant, one could feel the river's vibrant energy as it rushed through the valley below. Its rhythmic roar, a harmonious symphony with nature's chorus, provided a majestic backdrop to the serene atmosphere.

The occasional gush of cold wind swept through, invigorating the senses and adding a refreshing touch to the morning. This cool breeze, mingling with the warmth of the emerging sun, created a perfect balance, further enhancing the sense of rejuvenation and tranquility in this magical corner of the world.","The Como Shambhala Estate is without doubt one of the most beautiful properties I have stayed at. Just returned from an amazing 5 day stay on my own on the integrated wellness program and I cannot begin to describe how rested and rejuvenated I feel. Everything at the property and the service is geared to provide you with a first class and holistic wellbeing retreat. From the grounding energies of the property high above in the jungle forest, the nourishing soulful meals (that tastes as good as it looks) and the amazing treatments at the spa, it’s simply hard to imagine how they could make this offering any better. Everything is meticulously and carefully thought through (the gardens, the programs offered and even down to the plating of each dish!) with a service that is always warm, graceful and unassuming. The healing natural spring pools at Kedara was an absolute highlight and where I spent a few tranquil afternoons resting and swimming. A big shout out to Ayis and Meida for their kind hospitality, and to Yasmini, Ani and Rahayu who looked after all my meals so wonderfully. And of course Prasanth the wellness manager who is terrific. Well done to the Como Shambhala Estate management and staff team for creating an unparalleled luxury wellbeing retreat. I cannot wait to come back. It was simply perfect."

It’s one of our favourite places to visit when we need some rest & relaxation time!
The views, the deluxe suite, the gardens & the amazingly delicious restaurant food makes for a truly wonderful experience.","Pro:
I absolutely love my stay in Rijasa. The staff are really courteous and great. The room is so amazing!! Very clean, huge and luxurious. The balcony is huge, and there is a comfortable gazebo in balcony for you to relax while enjoying the view. The infinity pool is amazing, overlooking lush forest and ayung river. Staying here is the highlight of my trip.
Bed is bery comfortable. Hotel is very quiet and peaceful
The hotel is 30 min drive away from the main attractions in Ubud, but there is a free on demand shuttle service to take you around. I stayed during a low season, so it is easy to get the shuttle anytime i want. But during high season it might not be easy.

Con:
There is no jacuzzi in all rooms anymore, replaced by gazebo.  I was disappointed as i was not aware of this. A lot of reviews in this hotel mentioned jacuzzi.
There is no amenities around the hotel. No restaurant, no shops, nothing.
The restaurant allow smoking in all areas. It is a nightmare for non smokers.
The food preparation in hotel restaurant is very slow. Wait can be over 1 hour.
There is no sunbed around the pool, and the pool is too deep at 2 metres. And there is not lifesaving floatation device. Isn't this a safety lapse?
No kids pool","A majority of your stay in Bali should be spent in Ubud. It’s the most beautiful region in Bali. Rijasa is situated on the banks of Ayung river overlooking a valley with dense forest. The infinity pool is damn good from where you get a panaromic view of the valley and the resort. The rooms are large, spacious, clean and the whole property looks like some royal palace.

For an unforgettable Bali trip, Rijasa Agung should be on your list!","Really loved our stay at Rijasa. Location is bit away from Ubud but man o man, it was fantastic.

Right from the first time you enter the lobby, till we checked out the staff was really really supportive and helpful.

It has both swimming pools facing mountains and forest. Breakfast and mini bar was included which was good. We hired a scooter and it takes 30-40 mins to reach Ubud palace (famous landmark)

If you prefer to stay at a quiet location away from all the crowd, you can choose this. THEY PROVIDE FREE SHUTTLE TO UBUD PALACE 😍","The worst service and management I ever met.
Definitely not recommend anyone
They only have nice views but the service staff and management very bad.
Restaurant has no proper coffee (no coffee machine)
Staff not friendly and not flexible at all.
Worst experience 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"

Despite its simple and unassuming appearance, what truly sets it apart is the warm and homely service it offers. From the moment I arrived, the attentive staff and inviting atmosphere put me at ease and made me feel right at home. The service was so good, with daily room cleaning and fresh linens, including neat bedsheets and pillow covers. The washrooms were also kept neat and clean. What made the experience even more special was the lovely family who runs the place, along with their adorable dog, Ruby. They exuded the genuine hospitality and welcoming spirit of Balinese people. Moreover, the breakfast they served was delicious. If you're seeking a place that prioritizes warmth, comfort, and affordability over flashy decor, I wholeheartedly recommend this stay. I'm already looking forward to staying here again on my next Bali trip.","Great place to stay if you are with a bike. Cozy room, nice breakfast, comfortable stay is guaranted by the owners. Thanks!",If you want to visit Bali we recommend staying at Vaneka Garden House. The family is the most hospitable we have ever met. The wifi works perfect. There is space for parking. The room was super clean and they even cleaned it for us every day. Breakfast was delicious. The family helped us with everything we needed and made our stay amazing.

It was honestly one of the best settings I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Had a cool and mysterious Jurassic-park kind of vibe with lush greenery everywhere. What I loved was that everybody was extremely kind and professional, and the hotel property was stunningly beautiful. Great restaurant, gym, pool and spa services too.

Good selection of Indonesian and western foods.",This amazing dining experience has both international and Indonesian cuisine - both delicious! On Friday night there is traditional Balinese dancing which is spectacular. And if you get a table on the edge of the dining room the view of the stars over the gorge is amazing.

We had the set menu that was included in our three night stay package. Great food and service, but only worth it if you are staying at Como Shambhala or already coming here for the spa - I wouldn’t make a trip here for it.","Just OK quality but terrible value for money. If the prices would be that of a good restaurant anywhere in Bali it would be pleasant experience - but if you see the prices that are above Cuca or Mosaic or any other TOP restaurants in Bali it becomes a meh experience where you will notice dated and scratched tables, dated tableware, dated furniture and restaurant design straight out of a 20 years old Bali picture book. Service staff is fine and attentive but Jesus Christ you can't compensate for this prices and give any good value back.
To make it short if you want to pay 200$ for a 30$ experience this is the right place.
PS: the breakfast was also sooo below average if considering the price tag and reputation attached to the estate and Como group...",Very very good !,Delicious dishes.,Nice food
