You are a few hours from civilization but if that’s what you’re looking for this place is perfect. Staff and House is 10/10. Pleaseeee get you a massage everyday if you have time! The ladies are phenomenal!,"Beautiful resort. Nice accommodations  Fun and relaxing activities were offered. Each villa was unique.

The staff was fantastic,  the beds were comfortable and the food was delicious.

Can't wait to return!","We found La Balian Villa quite by accident while travelling around Bali. After a day of navigating the roads and the traffic it was such a relief to find a beautiful relaxing place, set in rice fields, to sit and unwind by the pool with a drink in hand. Unfortunately we only had one night there due to commitments elsewhere, but we were made so welcome by the staff who were very helpful.
We had a well appointed and comfortable bedroom with a bathroom overlooking nature and with various separate areas to sit and relax without being disturbed we wished that we could have stayed longer. Next time our plan is to stay one week here armed with books and bathers!! Thank you for a Balian jewel.","Just got home from a wonderful week at La Balian, the photos don't do it justice, the location is perfect, not too far from the action yet the setting is so tranquil.  The villas and grounds are all new and comfortable with gorgeous alfresco bathrooms.  The staff were so friendly and welcoming, we can't wait to go back again. Totally recommend it.","Wow what a relief to sleep in such a comfortable bed and my wife was delighted by the amount of light in the bathroom, two important things for us which we seldom find in Bali. And the food prepared by the in house staff was delicious. By the way....that was our second stay, so no need to say any more except we'll keep going back."
