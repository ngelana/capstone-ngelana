Beautiful spacious room with jacuzzi and outdoor shower. Very good food with reasonably priced drinks. We arranged for all our clothes to be laundered, excellent value and also had a couples massage. The village focuses on diving with a few other places to eat and a supermarket, but is otherwise quite limited. There are some lovely short walks available with amazing views of Agung. A little difficult to find as google sent us the wrong way, hopefully the owner will update. Highly recommended.","I have been getting lunch there.
High prices for the quality. And they didn't  explain properly the meals, u can not use the swimming pool or the sunbed if you just come to get the lunch.
Expensive, no quality, and not friendly","We stayed there for 2 nights and it was
Amazing. The staff is so lovely and the bungalows very well equipped and very comfortable as well. The food was really good too- oh and so convenient to be that close to the diving center and sites as well. Also, stunning and relaxing view from swimming pool, we couldn‚Äôt get enough of it.
Note on internet : it was perfect everywhere in the resort although we aimed to disconnect as much as we could.","Absolutely stunning room and bathroom but you have to keep in mind it is a 3 star hotel so the mattress and pillows are not the best. It was perfectly clean and the offered a LOT of mosquito products, which was great!! The hotel is right in front of the beach and the snorkeling conditions there are amazing! You have some restaurants in the area. Amed is around 25 min away with a lot more options.
The one point I have to criticize is the breakfast. I would not recommend paying for it in the hotel. It is extremely poor!! You have to choose one option from around 10 I think (rice, eggs, toast..) and you get some fruits. That‚Äôs it! There was only cow milk. We paid roughly 100‚Ç¨/night and I‚Äôd say you are paying for a great room in front of the beach and a great pool. In comparison to other hotels in Bali it is very pricey. I‚Äôd say they have to improve the breakfast! If they do, it‚Äôd probably be worth the price.","Me and my husband stayed at this hotel for 1 night while on our honeymoon, so we could experience scuba diving.
This place is just beautiful. We had top class service from start to finish. Such lovely people that couldn't do enough to assist you. The rooms are amazing with mosquitoe nets round the bed. All the amenities including very good air con. Also a huge whirlpool bath! Food was very good and excellent price. The pool area was well maintained with the most beautiful view.
The area is very quiet but this suited us as we wanted a little romantic break.
This place is a diving paradise. Right outside is the shipwreck and plenty of diving spots.
We really are sad to only have one night here and hope we can return one day.
Thank you for an amazing stay!"

Location is pretty much in front of Liberty wreck Ship! Walk distance to the beach 5 minutes by walk, there‚Äôs even shortcut next to this accommodation.

Breakfast is really tasty, my favorite is Banana Pancake, their watermelon juice as welcome drink (depends on their availability) also refreshing!

The staff are super friendly, smiling at you sincerely and happy to serve!
They seems to be well trained and professional at their jobs!

The pool is massive and deep enough for you to dive! The pool also clean and well maintained.

The garden around the property is very pretty and refreshing. You‚Äôll hear birds chirping in the morning and in the afternoon.

Highly recommended.
5/5*","We stayed here to go snorkelling on the liberty wreck before going to Gili Meno. Perfect location for that, 10 min walk to the entry point for snorkelling the wreck.

The accommodation was great too, clean, big good AC, nice pool, quiet etc... Everything you could.hope for. Food was cheap and good quality, beer was cheap too.

Would recommend.","Great place to be in between our dives at Dive Concepts!
Very nice staff, great atmosphere and overall a nice place to be.
Room looked really nice and was clean.
We loved our stay here.","Super warm headed and helpful stuff here. I forgot my glasses in the room, they just helped finding it and sending it all the way from Tulamben to Jimbaran, across the whole Bali‚Ä¶I‚Äôm truly grateful, and highly recommend this place!","I really enjoy my stay here, every time taking a break after my shore diving in Tulamben, being part of Bali's peaceful tropical nature. Delicious breakfast & dinner can be booked a day before. The French owner must spent huge efforts on its garden & pool & rooms. I highly recommend this place where you can really relax your body & soul within reasonable budget."

The villa is so perfect it was like a utopia, I wanted to stay forever üòç","Beautiful, peaceful place. I spent Christmas here with my family and it was absolutely wonderful. Helpful, friendly staff. Oka provided everything we needed. Trips, scooters, gala dinner. If you are looking for relaxation, but also fun, we recommend it to everyone!","Absolutely amazing place to stay, super relaxed atmosphere and a true beach villa vibe.

Because there are only 3 villa's along this stretch of beach front and they're each separated by natural bush, it makes it the perfect place if you want a bit more privacy, for sunbathing, swimming in the pool etc.

This area of Tulamben is well known for it's diving and snorkelling so the villa has snorkelling gear ready use and a private access to the beach to go snorkelling or swimming.

With it being the perfect spot to see the sunrise from the lower sunbeds or in the pool it is definitely an insta snap in every direction you look, if that's your thing too.

After staying here for a few day's you'll definitely wish this place was home.",,
