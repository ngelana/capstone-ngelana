Then Platinum Executive Club might be your perfect pitch! Located on Jl. Suwung Batan Kendal, this upscale karaoke bar offers a luxurious ambiance with top-notch facilities.

From what I've seen online, the private rooms boast a five-star feel, complete with impressive sound systems and comfortable seating. Reviewers rave about the friendly service and the extensive song selection.  If the pictures are true, the vibe seems perfect for a fun night out with friends or a special occasion.

However, it's important to consider that there's limited information available online besides what appears to be a social media presence.  While some reviews mention value for money, others seem to suggest it might be on the pricier side.

Overall, Platinum Executive Club seems like a promising option for a high-end karaoke experience in Denpasar. If you're looking to splurge on a night of belting out your favorite tunes in style, this spot could be worth checking out!  Just be sure to do some extra research on pricing and maybe even contact them directly before heading down.",Nice atmosphere for karaoke but small people wjo.can speak Japanese and poor list of Japanese song.,the best pokoe,"It was really good time with friends priceable staff was so friendly
My friend was book for VIP room but when we arrive there's not available for the VIP room and they are send to regular room and it was not bad and we have funny stories that we are ordered some chivas and white wine and there complete with some fruits we don't understand it was separate bill if I Know I would like to take  away home so if you guys want to visit this karaoke platinum make sure make clear the order for the bill so you don't waste , enjoy your day  "" cheers ""","Good place,  good service,  good for lady room (ms.rika),  good room,"

I think that their fried chicken is one of the best in town.
Only 55K for package of fried chicken, rice, soup, and some side dishes. It's really worth to try!!","Food is cheap, good tasting and clean. Service people are friendly. I had pork bone soup, braised pork rice (lu rou fan) and pot stickers. I recommend the pot stickers.","The best dining place around Serangan area!
It‚Äôs the most authentic Taiwanese cuisine you can get in Bali and it‚Äôs just really-really good!
One of those Asian gastro-treasures in the middle of a random street.
Even if you never been to Taiwan I bet you‚Äôll love it!
WeiWei became our ‚Äòmust stop by place‚Äô when we go to Sanur or Serangan.
Oh! And these rice cakes, ohh!
Yumm!","Generous portions and worth the price. The taste is authentic and delicious. The area is clean and spacious, and the service is friendly. There is a huge parking area.

The downside might be that if you are dining alone, it can make you feel self-conscious. It could also be crowded during Lunar New Year.","Amazing authentic Taiwanese food!! We drove all the way from Canggu to have dinner here. It was totally worth the drive :) I am half Taiwanese and haven‚Äôt had such good Taiwanese food outside of Taiwan in a long time. They even have papaya milk üòç The service was perfect, the girls were very friendly and fast. The price is very good as well.
