The place is simple and breezy so it's comfortable enough to dine in even in a hot weather. I suggest you to visit the restaurant to get the menu because they have alterations here and there. Bakso goreng and siomay is not always available and a bit hard to get via online order. I was told by the owner that bakso goreng is their best seller, I personally would recommend you to try the siomays. To get them just ask their contact person to make sure it's availability. ü•üüòã

Update: they moved from Tukad to jalan Dewata (near satu titik)! Pricing didn't change and they added addittional tables. There is a big parking space (free). When I visited I was the only order they have and I waited at the outdoor area, sadly every single table has ants üêú. I hope it can be improved.","the bakmi is okay, chewy, the broth is legit üëåüèº
love the siomay, super tender, and really umami.

a bit difficult to find a car park, but the atmosphere is great, feels like having meal in gradma‚Äôs house","Delicious honey chicken charsiu noodles! I recommend to add some chili oil to make the noodles taste it even better. The bakso goreng was really good too. It's a new menu, not printed on the menu book yet, so make sure you ask for it. The place is homey, looks like an actual home.","Went there for dinner last Saturday.
Their Bakmie is actually taste good, best one on that price point that got us ordered for a second bowl.
Their beef meltique tastes so good, juicy and tender. The flavour is simple yet powerful. Very recommended to add the chili oil and add the broth little by little as it is a type of dry noodles (we finished the broth anyway).
If you are a big eater like us, I will suggest to add noodles+topping (again, the beef meltique is the best option imo as its only +15k)

Overall a great experience.
Just remember to take a close look as their signage board is not that big.","I recently had the pleasure of dining at Bakmie Tjoa, and I must say it was a delightful experience. The fried meatball they serve is absolutely delicious! Its crispy exterior gives way to a savory and succulent interior that left me wanting more.

But what truly stole the show was their Wagyu noodle dish. The combination of tender Wagyu beef and perfectly cooked noodles was nothing short of amazing. The flavors melded together beautifully, creating a harmonious and satisfying meal. The texture of the noodle was spot on, firm yet chewy, making every bite a pleasure.

Aside from the delectable food, the owner of Bakmie Tjoa was incredibly friendly and welcoming. Their warm hospitality added an extra layer of enjoyment to the dining experience, making me feel like a valued guest.

Overall, I highly recommend Bakmie Tjoa to anyone in search of a delicious and satisfying meal. This place is a true gem. Don't miss out on the fantastic food and the friendly atmosphere."
