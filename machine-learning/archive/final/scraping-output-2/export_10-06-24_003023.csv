A small donation is always welcome üôè","A truly spiritual experience with the powerful water amidst the green fields
Don‚Äôt forget to bring your sarong if you want to get inside the holy water","A hidden gem in the middle of rice paddies. The only possible access is by motorbike, there is no way around that. The road is doable, the workers use it every day, yet it is a bit rough. Make sure you are acquainted with the rites you will do at the temple, you must do them on your own. There are changing rooms, you must wear sarong and proper clothing for the ceremony, you can change afterwards into dry clothes.","Easy way to get into the holy water, and nice rice field view around.",
