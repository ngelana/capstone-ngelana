Kuta, Kabupaten Badung, Bali 80361, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=4234273872765526091,OPERATIONAL,+62 821-4600-8787,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.3,62,,"Stayed here for 2 weeks, great location in the seminyak area but also really quiet which made my stay super comfortable! Spacious room with an amazing service from all staff. Definitely recommend and will be back again.","Stayed for 9 nights. Big room, hot shower, cold air-conditioning, shared kitchen and fridge area. The best thing is the location, only 2 minutes to the main Sunset Rd by bike, but so tranquil and peaceful being down a quiet road. The staff were friendly and helped with bags, laundry, and local advice without even having to ask. Recommended for a longer stay of a week or more. Book through Agoda because the direct rate is more.","Dirty place. I asked for refund they declined. The swimming pool is not here btw, it belongs to their Villa part.","They stole my 2 mln Rp deposit and don‚Äôt give it back.
My advice ‚Äì don‚Äôt stay here if you don‚Äôt want to be robbed.

On my departure day said they don‚Äôt have cash. Two weeks later after everyday messages from me said they have sent money online and I should check the problem with the bank. Then I discovered they used the wrong name and even wrong bank. Said its my problem. Constantly refuse to give money in cash.

It‚Äôs been already one and a half MONTHS since I have left the place and still no money.

What makes the story even more sad, I'm not the only one with this problem cause the owner just don't give money to the staff to give the deposits back.

Also, the Wi-fi is very slow and its impossible to work / watch movies. The walls are thin and you can hear your neigbours. The river nearby smells. And there is a constant construction noise.

Upd 1.

3 months later I finally got the deposit, but in SGD and only 1 500 000 (for their own reasons they chose to pay me via Singapore bank and paid 500 000 of my deposit to cover the transfer expenses of the bank). So, if you choose to stay at Amanlane just be prepared to fight for your deposit with the greedy owner and unprofessional accountant.

Upd 2.

Dear Amanlane owner,
So nice to have a comment from you after 3 months of trying to solve the problem.
Never too late)

And let me reply that it's an exaggeration to say that the problem was my bank cause it wasn't:

1. You didn't prepare money beforehand and refused to give the deposit back on my departure day. And I know that it's a common practice of your place, I'm not the only victim there.

2. You hired an unprofessional accountant who wasn't able to make a transaction FOR THREE MONTHS and instead of trying to solve the problem advised me to go to the bank by myself.

3. And the last, but not least, you charged me 500 000 IDR just for nothing - only because your service is lame.

So let me kindly ask you to start working on your service improvement because it is definitely not professional at any point.",Had a great stay in amanlane suites. Very friendly staff. Had a good time.

We made friends with the owner and managers Wen and Nana! Always willing to help with anything and saw them as friends ü•∞ also the local cats and dogs are friendly and we miss them everyday ü•≤

The villa is 2 bedrooms with lots of storage for long term stays like us. The area is fairly local with a few foreigners like myself. It‚Äôs a nice mix and everyone is friendly. It is also very strategic to travel to almost anywhere.
There is a few lovely cafes around such as circle cafe and samaja cafe.

There was lots of space for parking bikes, and they weee upgrading to fit a car as we were leaving. The pool is a lovely addition, where you can also sunbathe on the 2 loungers.

Kitchen is equipped with everything you would need, including microwave and rice cooker.

If I could post 0 stars I would, this is the most disgusting villa I have ever been to, the images speak for themselves
Stains on couches and dining chairs
Doors that don't close properly so geckos and mosquitoes were inside the rooms.
The pillows look like they've never been cleaned and (see image)

Seeing people's reviews about how close it is to city centre is the biggest lie, extremely secluded and when you leave theres an alleyway of aggressive dogs

Left upon arrival",We enjoyed our stay here. Spacious and clean villa. Suitable for a big group. They welcomed us with fresh fruits and juice upon check in. This villa is great but could use some minor touch up as it looks a bit old.,Name changed to maribel its much better now,"I love the villa here. Just 10 minutes from the seminyak by car.
