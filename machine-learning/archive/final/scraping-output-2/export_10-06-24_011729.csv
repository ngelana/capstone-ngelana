I love everything about the place. The owner, the location, the vibes, the room, the bathroom (water pressure, water heater, cleanliness), and the neighbors!.

The cottage itself is beautiful and big. You feel like you are living in the forest with all green around. There are a few mosquitoes so we could not really open the glass doors, but the feeling of living in green is still very good.

Maybe one thing is that the high wooden roof retains the heat, so the air condition can hardly reach out to the ceiling and make the room fresh - especially for the beds which are suspended quite high. I guess if the beds can be put on the floor instead, it would be much fresher.","I highly recommend Pier26 Homestay! My partner and I had a wonderful experience during our stay.

Anytime I‚Äôm coming to Bali I will ask them to rent me bike I will never deal with anyone else","Had no issues at all.
We rented two 125cc Vario scooters for 3 days and ended up extending it for an extra day by messaging them on WhatsApp.

The scooters were in good condition with some cosmetic issues but nothing that would prevent us from riding them. The breaks, lights, engine, lockable under seat storage was all working.

Fuel tank size was about 5 liters which gets you around plenty, especially with unleaded pumps on every corner.

I know some reviews mentioned that original documents were not included so if it helps I can tell you that both our scooters had a laminated card with scooter information (registration, model, cc, owner,..).
I am not sure if that is all that is required in Bali when police stop you but hopefully it helps any future riders to know that it is included.

Helmets provided were open face with either a clear visor or sun visor but not both. If you plan to ride at night I suggest getting a clear visor and bringing a pair of sunglasses with you for day riding.
If you are staying in Bali for a while and plan on riding frequently just buy/bring a helmet that's a good fit and has both visors. It is a worthwhile investment - I speak from personal experience.

Overall a good rental experience (and nothing bad happened to us while we were riding)"

Also I was said to stay in another room which looked much more pleasant than the one I stayed in. Both the owner and the employee were sympathetic and I got 80% of the money already paid back. The accommodation is located in a quiet area - you absolutely need a motorbike to reach supermarkets, beaches, restaurants etc.","Unfortunately, due to a false advertisement, we had the worst experience with this property. It was me a friend traveling, and we basically booked a room with two double beds (according to the advertised). When we got to the property, there was only one double bed in the room, and the owner was trying to push us another room, for extra money (which was over our budget), and we obviously didn't accept. So we had to search for other place on the last minute, and it was agreed with the owner a full refund. To this day, no refund was given, and the owner been ignoring all my messages as well as the platform we used messages... Looks like a lack of character that unfortunately made us have the worst experience with accomodations so far. Avoid it at all costs!",,,
