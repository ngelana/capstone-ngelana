Everything's good for it's price range. Very worth la.
The room, the service, the pool, all's good.
Just the staff forgot about the 15% discount for FnB, but I think I find that kind of problem everywhere around here.

Maybe I'll go here again.","Stayed four time in here
We love it here..Feels like home..
But Sometime we got good room (when we got lucky)
And Sometime we got the room need to have more attention to detail..like the switch or the power point almost falling down to the floor, the air-conditioning is not cold enough for big room..

But anyway overall
We love to stay here..
