But I won‚Äôt recommend you to visit there if you‚Äôre too hungry. Gotta wait for the food around 40 mins for just eating less then 10 mins

Also need to wait staff for a while until she came to get order. Also a lot of insects"

Suksuma üôè","This homestay was the highlight of our trip to Bali. Suki and his family were the perfect hosts. The homestay rooms are very clean, spacious and fitted out well with a lovely porch area and Koi fish pond that has a lovely water feature that relaxes your mind with the sound of flowing water. Priced correctly considering that it is situated in the heart of Penglipuram village, this homestay is a perfect place to enjoy your time away from home but feel right at home with the family. The family and generally the people of the village are truly lovely and beautiful to live with and made us feel welcome and loved over the 5 days and 4 nights that we spent there. A class of its own. We will cherish the experience we had here and will certainly be back for more in the years to come.","Amazing Homestay with great owners, especially dinner and breakfast. Quiet and near a walkable bamboo forest!",,
