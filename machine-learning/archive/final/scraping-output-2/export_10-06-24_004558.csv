It is a purely 5 star experience.","A great place to stay! Other than the great service we received they surprised me for my birthday! I came back to my room and I saw a decorated bed with happy birthday sign and of course a cake  song! Lol who expect that from a hotel?

Experience exceptional service, friendly staff, and beautifully appointed rooms. Enjoy the stunning view from the front pool, and be amazed by the private villa featuring its own plunge pool.

My birthday. The food is delicious here I even had seconds. I definitely recommend, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. They have a variety of options on the menu. So much things to do and it‚Äôs in a prime location","This location is BEAUTIFUL ! So many room options - we stayed on the 1st floor where we could see the infinity pool right out back - we came from US and this was our 1st place we stayed. So many people from All over but some European guests don‚Äôt follow rules and invade other tourists/ guests space by taking over balconies or pool areas but besides THAT - this location is SUPERB!! Very Quiet, Traditional Culture everywhere!
Very Clean, Very Honest & Respectful. Food Delicious, especially the Breakfast Buffet‚Ä¶ I just Love, Love, LOVE this Resort and Staff üíúüòé

Being run by a family, this establishment offers a unique ""home away from home"" experience that is truly unparalleled. From the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed and cared for as if I were part of their family. The personalized attention and cozy atmosphere made my stay incredibly special. It's not just a hotel; it's a true sanctuary where you can unwind and feel completely at ease. I highly recommend Ubad Retreat to anyone looking for a peaceful and intimate getaway. The personal touch and warmth of this family-run retreat create a truly unforgettable experience that sets it apart from traditional hotels.","Had a wonderful four days at the Ubad Retreat. Sri and her staff were gracious, kind and professional. I did not want to leave and will return as soon as I can! I especially loved the beautiful gardens with detail descriptions of many plants and trees.","We had a stay of four days in Ubud Retreat and it felt like home away from home. It's a place to rejuvenate and connect to nature. Staff is so kind and welcoming with really good service. Seri is really a good host and caretaker.
We really missed this place. Hope, we will visit this place again in future.","We stayed in Ubad Retreat, Ubud (2 rooms) for 7 nights and we couldn't be happier with that decision. Its a nice cozy family run place that treats you like family during the stay. The rooms are really nice with comfortable beds and amenities. The bathroom is quite large with showers and bathtubs. The internet provided is really fast and we never had any issues with it. The resort is filled with a lot of trees and plants that give it a nice calm feel. The free breakfast included in the price was pretty decent and we had 5 choices everyday to choose from. We tried almost everything on the breakfast menu during our stay and I can vouch that its pretty good. The restaurant also serves coffee, lunch and dinner and the food is very tasty. If you are looking for a nice relaxed, no frills place then Ubad retreat is the place to come. The resort is run by Gus and his family. Gus was really helpful in planning a sight seeing itinerary for me and helped with taxis as well. The driver (Dewa) who took us around was a very kind and polite man helping us at all places. Seri who takes care of the restaurant and kitchen also treated us like family and developed a special bond with my mom. When one day, we went on a rather packed day trip to Nusa Penida, my mom decided to stay back in the resort. Gus and Seri learned about that and took care of her by delivering lunch to the room. We were really delighted by that gesture and experience. You don't get that in a name brand 5 star hotel.

Overall we had a great vacation in Bali and a Ubad retreat tops the reasons apart from Bali itself for that. We would definitely come back and stay here if we decide to visit Bali once again. Thanks Gus & Seri !!","Happy, kind, amazing and helpful staff. Helped us rent a scooter and always made sure we were safe. No problem with communication! The place is clean and beautiful. The breakfast is so good and the location is just 10min drive from the streets with food restaurant‚Äôs, bars and shopping! We are very happy with our stay, hope to see you again! (Thanks for a wonderful goodbye Gusti!)"

What an experience!!!
Highly recommended! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è","Stayed here for 5 days while in Ubud and absolutely loved the place. The Villa was so beautiful - the place was clean, it had all the amenities, and management was always available. We had Adi taking care of us and he was such a sweet soul. Breakfast was provided every morning (fresh with lots of variety). The Villa pool is really nice and the location is only a 10 min ride to most restaurants / main centre. Highly recommend!","The Meranggi villa was absolutely stunning. The bungalow was first class with everything you need or would want, and the outdoor bathroom was equally as nice. Very clean and modern. The only let down was the pool needed a solid clean of the tiles. Otherwise, this slice of paradise was perfect, as long as you are happy to be removed from the hustle and bustle of Ubud, and any real dining options.","Very nice staff, the villa is just perfect. A good get away with your loved one. The attractions like monkey forrest etc. are a bit further away than described.
Had a lovely romantic stay.","The villas here are gorgeous! It's a boutique style accomodation tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Unud in a quiet village setting and its amazing here. I loved the traditional style teak villa with the most stunning traditional wood carved furniture. The bed is ridiculously comfy, I always had a good sleep. The private pool is amazing. The gardens are full of the most gorgeous plants and flowers. You get a beautiful breakfast every morning and a complementary shuttle drop off to Ubud or Monkey Forest/Nyuh Kuning if required. They even organised an airport pick up for us at $350k IRD. Adi manages the villas and he is the best person at his job. No detail is missed. Everything we requested came on time. We would highly recommend this accommodation to anyone looking for a beautiful luxury villa near Ubud in a private and serene location."

We could hear the river flowing below our room which was really special.
The breakfast was really tasty. Great to be served quality bread, butter, an awesome omelette, also had fluffy pancakes one day and it's always served with fresh fruits too, the Himalayan salt was a great touch and the natural spring water is far better than other water we've had around Bali.
I am sure we'll be backüôè","Lumina is a hidden gem in Ubud. The entire place is tasteful and artfully designed. As a Balinese hotel owner, I really appreciate the designer's attention to authentic and traditional details that make this place special. The view from each room is simply breathtaking. The owner is a talented artist, and it's obvious that she puts so much love into the property. Thank you so much Ibu Carolyn and Lumina team for allowing me to enjoy your magical place. I will definitely come back.","Lumina is a blast of old Bali where the beauty of nature merges with the designer‚Äôs spectacular interiors. The antique wooden cottages are thoughtfully appointed with the flair of a feng shui master, set in lush gardens with volcano, river and rice field views. 17 individually-designed rooms are named after flora and fauna, with each entry hand-painted accordingly; some offer kitchenettes and A/C. The riverside setting is perfect for a romantic getaway, meditative healing retreat, or doing a detox journey. The owner (a luxury-brand jewelry designer) shared her vision of the property as a ‚Äúhealth haven‚Äù‚Äîonce fully operational it will offer personalized re-set and rejuvenation, with spring water pools, permaculture garden, and Body/Mind/Spirit-enhancing activities and programs. There is nothing missing in this full-on feast for the senses.‚Äîtruly the best of Bali.","I absolutely LOVED my stay at Lumina! Was so beautiful, so quiet and peaceful. My room and front lobby was very clean and the staff were absolutely AMAZING. The energy felt was like nothing I‚Äôve experienced in my year of living in Ubud. I felt so refreshed and energized every day (two weeks stay). I will definitely be back and share with others. It‚Äôs a must.","Although temporarily closed for renovations, we were invited to stay a few days and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

We are a family of four with 2 young children, the environment is perfect for those looking to relax and unwind with waterfall surroundings, many swimming pools, beautiful sunrises and perfect hospitality to ensure a pleasant stay.

Thank you to all the staff and we hope to see you again soon!"

Great scenery, not too far located from city area (if you are riding). The host, Nick is super nice and friendly. He prepares good breakfast.

In the bathroom and in the kitchen there is absolutely everything for your comfort and cooking. The villa is located away from the road, so it is very quiet and peaceful here.

The villa is in a quiet and remote area. The staff was very discrete and nice.
The rooms are spacious and the pool is beautiful.
The only downside is that if you don‚Äôt want to eat at the villa, you have to take the car.","Excellent stay in this luxurious and beautiful traditional style and modern home. Tasteful decoration, nice and confortable rooms , great pool... Perfect location in the middle of rice fields , away from city busy traffic but still very close to all main interesting spots in Ubud. Staff very nice and helpful ... Paradise !","What a great place ! We were 6 French tourist coming to Bali for the first time. And honestly I have to admit, it was a very great experience ! Ubud was one of my favorite place on the island and hopefully Omah padi villa was just in that area ! All those rice field and temple, so inspiring.. so the location is just perfect.
The house is the perfect size, the swimming pool always clean and the view on the rice field is a must.
Ps : you can book a cook to come to the villa every morning for the evening, just saying what you want to eat, I think the best is to tell him what kind of food you like and don‚Äôt like ( chicken, beef, vegetables etc.. ) and let him improvise, you‚Äôll be surprise and in the good way ! üëèüèª

During my stay I had an accident and they were very helpful, helping me out with all the things that I need. One can question, can my real family would be so kind? :)","Made and his wife are the PERFECT hosts!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I stayed for one month and have to say that it was a wonderful experience.
The family around and also his brother with his kids were always open for a chat and a laugh and both hosts will help you with anything you need and want to make your stay perfect.
The room is spacious and the bed is not too soft or hard.
The bathtub is the best part of the appartment as it fits even someone who is tall as me (almost 2m;) and the kitchen is (same as the rest of the house) almost brand new and everything you need (also a blender).
You are not in the city center of Ubud but with your own scooter or car you'll be there in less than 10min.
Yoga center is just 6min away and the titi Batu club also just 7min.
The surrounding of the house at that tiny canyon is just amazing with its jungle and sounds. You can see the sunrise from your room (especially the upstairs room).
I stayed in both rooms, upstairs and downstairs but prefer the upstairs room as the balconies face the rice fields but upstairs you see way more.

Contact Made and he will negotiate a fair price with you.

Thank you for that beautiful time in Ubud.","It‚Äôs perfect place! I like staying here so much! I lived in the second floor with incredible view of rice terrace. The best part of my life. Thank you owner Made and his wife. Every 2 day cleaning, hot water, air conditioner, kitchen - everything is perfect. I am missing!",The family is extremely accommodating and very welcoming. I feel right at home in the company of this loving family. The space is very clean and the bathtub is an extra bonus. The internet is reliable which is hard to find in Bali.
