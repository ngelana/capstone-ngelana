Great for kids and family day trips.
Pool bar is amazing and the bar has variety of Indonesian food and western.
Definitely a must visit place while in Bali.","Beautiful and (during the week) quiet water sports area. You can water ski, swim and there is a restaurant.","Great place for wakeboarding in bali. Kids love the over water playground. Spent good time here, though a very hot sunny day","Went to Bali wake park today

Totally great experience this is the first time to Bali wake park and the staff were so helpful

The equipment is so up to date

You can see Maintance is done regularly and the water is super clean

Nailed a few jumps today and find that the 1 hour slow session and the 1 hour fast session is a great balance to try new things and then push yourself

Totally do this",This place is excellent! So much fun! And they have a little practice line just incase youre not ready to take on the main line. Especially good if you plan on doing it all day and pay for the all day package. üëç

The Dolphins are looked after so well. They even rescued some from other dolphin places that we not good. They took the dolphins that couldn't be released and have given them a wonderful home. The experience we had was so magical.  We didn't ride the dolphins.  It was all about them, we got to feed them and touch them. The dolphins didn't have to do anything they didn't want to. The dolphins were every friendly and inquisitive. We absolutely love this","This experience was one to tick off the bucket list when my partner and I travelled to Bali. Interacting, feeding and gently petting the smooth skin of these amazing creatures? Say no more.

There‚Äôs no wonder why these marine creatures are one of, or if not, the most intelligent species second to humans. Their ability to interpret signals, gestures,  remember patterns and execute an act perfectly without flaw is phenomenal.

We learnt so much about these amazing creatures through the assistance of the instructors based at Bali Exotic Marine Park.

Overall, the experience was amazing and the price was right (cheaper in contrast to Australia), and hence I do recommend you and your family/partner to give it a crack and have the privilege to be in such close proximity to this beautiful marine animal.","Was great experience I really loved it and great amazing team that were adorable and so helpful in all ways and always smiley. They work with happiness and they reflect it on you . Special thanks and lots of kisses and love to everyone who were in my great experience in Bali exotic marine park

The doplines were very playful. :),"We had an amazing experience and surely recommend everyone to go and pick the discovery package where you can actually get to interact with dolphine and swim with them. Get to touch them, middle in the water dolphins will come to you and jump around you. Very good co-operative staff."

The food was not good taste. Also the service very very late.. i think because the staff not enough.. the temperature air is hot too even the ac is on.","Best place for Chinese fine Dining. The unique atmosphere, interesting food and friendly staff make the dinner experience at Ang Restaurant complete","The interior design and the details of the cutleries amazed me when i first entered the restaurant. The dishes are all tasty and totally giving the fine dining experience of chinese food that you expected.

Recommended to visit, and they also have home rescued dolphins on the first floor (you can check out Bali Marine Park package). If you bring a big family / travel group and looking for a tourist attraction as well as good meal afterwards in Bali, go come by. The staffs are friendly and well mannered although some of them must be new occupied since this restaurant just opened in early 2023 I guess? The only thing can be criticized is, the portion of the food that can make me gain some weights (every portion is plenty) hahaha‚úåüèº

looking forward to taste other menus in the future","Not as good as the looks on instagram and menus

Foods is so tasteless and taking to long to come out

Place is hot and over priced

It's not  A FINE dining...the foods is worse

Thanks for good and nice photos of menus and instagram üôèüèª

I didn't took photos of all
The foods cos is so bad","today I had lunch at ang restaurant, they have the theme of Chinese food and the food in this restaurant is very complete, there are seafood, dimsum, they also provide halal food (without pork) in one of the dishes, the restaurant is very cool and very clean, the staff  very friendly smile, this place is near sanur and they also have a good view of the GWK statue from far away.  thank you"
