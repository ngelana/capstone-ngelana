The staff amazing, and so warm and friendly, remembering us by name. Suite accommodation was great, with plenty of room for us all (5).
Our teens and I enjoyed a cooking class, including a trip to the market it was almost a whole day experience. Food was great, with a plentiful buffet breakfast each morning, and afternoon tea spread each afternoon.
We enjoyed the light BBQ by the pool one night for dinner. Overall a wonderful experience, and many life long friends and memories made.","Fantastic service from Atika at reception who was so friendly and helpful throughout.  All the other staff were fantastic also! Our stay was amazing, beds comfortable, beautiful pools and outside setting. Our breakfasts and all our restaurant meals were delicious.

Certainly coming back again.","I enjoyed a delightful stay at this hotel. The location is excellent, providing easy access to nearby attractions. The staff were exceptionally accommodating; from the welcome drinks to a smooth check-out process (thanks to Stefany).

I love the balcony and pool area, perfect spot for relaxation. Although some parts of the room showed signs of wear, the overall value and excellent service more than made up for it. Highly recommended for a comfortable stay at a reasonable price."

I stayed in the 1 Bedroom Larger Suite, 1 King, Whirlpool for over a week.

Everything was perfect from the room, the breakfast, the facilities and most importantly the staff. Every staff member was friendly and welcoming. They went above and beyond to make me feel right at home.

The breakfast offered a huge selection of food and everyday they had something different to keep the taste buds well entertained.

The room itself was fantastic, an extremely comfortable bed and best of all the whirlpool Jacuzzi, which was put to good use every night.

I had an amazing stay here and I will definitely return. I can‚Äôt thank you all enough, amazing people and a well run hotel, which felt like home.

The breakfast is varied, the food is delicious.
Since I can't eat everything due to health problems, there is a lot of food that I can eat.
The rooms are very tidy, there is everything you need in them.
It is quiet.
The view from the hotel is not bad.
All the workers are very nice , polite, sociable, cultured...
As a welcome we received a delicious cold tea, and they gladly gave me some more to drink because I really liked it. The only downside is that there are certain hours for swimming in the pool, most likely so people can sleep.
I really like night swimming, so that's one minus for me."

It's mostly instagrammable and the dished didn't taste as good as they seemed.

The service was quite kind but very slow as the restaurant was packed and they couldn't successfully control the peak.

We ordered the smashed avocado stack which was ok (a lot of unnecessary bread in my opinion), and the pineapple, banana & mango smoothie bowl which was kind of boring and bland (but still you could feel the ingredients were fresh, in their defense).

Lastly, we couldn't not to order their famous giggly pancakes (AKA porncakes) so we went for the new york cheesecake pancake which was a bit too sweet, but super fluffy as promised.","Amazing place for breakfast  highly recommended

The hotel was simply stunning, with spacious and clean rooms, friendly staff, and the tastiest breakfast you could ever imagine.

But let me tell you, the real highlight of this incredible hotel was the rooftop swimming pool - it was absolutely breathtaking! We spent hours soaking up the sun and taking in the stunning views of the surrounding area. Plus, the hotel had a spacious gym and tons of activities to keep us entertained every day.

And to top it all off, the hotel even offered a free shuttle every hour to take us to the beach.

This hotel was an absolute dream come true. We can't wait to go back!","What a shame, a beautiful hotel with great rooms and lovely facilities for a good price.
Unfortunately the staff there are thieves and will take your money if you have the chance.
Today checking out I was given my bill for my laundry for $78!
Yes you read that right, 78 dollars for about 3kg of washing.
For reference, in Bali this will normally be done to the exact same standard for about $4.
I attempted to argue it but I was told the form was filled out so there is nothing I can do.

An absolute outrage, you wouldn‚Äôt even pay that much in central London.
It‚Äôs a shame as I would love to recommend this place, but not when they treat paying customers like a cash cow.

I've stayed in Bali for 2 months and been travelling extensively so during that time I stayed in about 25 hotels all around Indonesia and I honestly never pay bad reviews but this hotel is just a warning to anyone who's planning to stay there.
I would prefer to sleep under the bridge rather than stay there!
For the same money you'll find much better hotels in the area.
Stay away from that place. It shouldn't be in business.
Smelly aircon in the rooms, noise from the roof, mouldy and stinky bathrooms, dirty linen. Yuck!","today is my last day waiting for check out and go to Jakarta. this morning at 06.00 the shower and closet bidet are out of water. After I called reception and  He said engineering staff is switching on the water pump. I have beeen waiting 30 minutes for the water the be used. It is bad for catching the schedule today.
Its not my first dissapointed staying in this hotel. We have been staying for 5 night payment settled at check in time. first night there was leakage on the indoor unit ac, we were in the family room on the 2nd floor. engineering staff fixed for an hour at 22.30 (sleeping time). on the 2nd night we found there is still leakage and we used garbage can for the leakage. the 3rd day we reported again about the leakage in the morning but we found leakage still at night when we came from activities outside, at the end at 4rd day we were moved to other room.
About the service, hotel staff always try the best service they could. I think the management / owner must know for improvement","Quite an unpleasant experience here, charged $20 dollars for a removable stain on the sheets, when asked to speak to management they said this wasn‚Äôt possible. The WIFI also did not work in the rooms, the draining system was clogged causing the sink to fill up and the sliding doors in the shower did not work. Would not recommend this hotel or revisit again.","I arrived at the hotel at 9pm Bali time. By the time I checked in, there's still plenty of room available throughout the building. I chose the 3rd floor, room 311. The sink jammed and the room is a little bit dusty (cobwebs present in the corner of the room as well). Called the technician to come over and fixed the sink. Moved to room 306 the 2nd day only to find out a broken down exhaust fan and a Called again and he said it would take a relatively long time in order to get it fixed so I just let it be. I can already tell what would it be since it's a 250k hotel which wasn't too pricey for me. The view is as expected, nothing new. A swimming pool is available on 6th floor. The service is average (3/5). These shouldn't occur next time. Best regards, Julian."

However, Recommend.","service was great, very friendly attendant that made sure we were taken care of. food was alright, a little bit on the salty side for us.  the surroundings were beautiful & most importantly, the gelato store is 10/10!"

Our Junior Suite was amazing.
Attached Mozzarella restaurant food was not up to the standard you would expect for the hotel.  The Breakfast however was good and had great variety. Our lunch on our first day was very ordinary. In fact other than included breakfast we didn't eat there again. Not paying good money for average food.","My partner and I had not stayed here before so we didn‚Äôt know what to expect, from the second you walked in the staff greet you with the biggest smiles and welcome drink/towel. We were slightly early too and were able to easily check in before 3PM without issue. We checked in on my birthday and shortly after being shown to our room, staff knocked on the door and about ten staff sung me happy birthday with a birthday cake, it was so beautiful! We booked the lagoon room and would definitely do again, you open your bedroom door and there‚Äôs steps that lead you into the main pool. The king bed was the comfiest bed we‚Äôve slept in. The bar staff are extremely friendly and make excellent cocktails also. The room service is fast and the food is excellent. The location of the hotel is mainly why we booked, you walked out and it‚Äôs a very short two minute walk to Legian beach (very close to Padma). I don‚Äôt think we will stay anywhere else in future because from start to finish this hotel was perfect. Planning to get married next year and this would be one of our choices to stay. Thank you Bandha for a wonderful experience, could not fault one thing. Elly and Jamie 1002.","Lovely hotel, very close to a great beach. Very professional, polite and helpful staff who excellent in their customer service.
Very high level of cleanliness through out the entire hotel, which is situated close to a variety of restaurants, shops, spas and bars.
We actually found the pillows too high! (Even the smaller ones) But clearly most people disagree.
Would definitely return,","Dirty Bed Sheets

Post for a friend who stayed here at the hotel.
The service in this hotel is great.
Most staff very helpful. Was not at all happy with the cleanliness in the room. Checked into my hotel with stains over the sheets and when I brought it up with reception and showed the photo they blamed me.
You should never have to sleep in sheets looking like this. So gross! I think for the money you pay for this hotel you should at least get clean sheets. I will not stay in this hotel again and do not recommend it.","We have stayed at several 5* hotel/resorts around Legian and Seminyak. The Bandha Hotel &Suites has the best rooms. Spacious, extremely clean and so much natural light entering the room. The best sleep we had. The bed is huge and comfortable. The bed linen was excellent, so soft, felt like silk. Staff were extremely nice and always smiling. Breakfast had quality food. Options were not huge compared to some other hotels, but it was our favourite. Everything was of high quality, food and coffee.  Everything was very tasty.   Coming back to this hotel with my parents next week because it's that good."

Thanks!! ‚ú®","Absolutely delicious food, great location and amazing staff.. we were served by Charles and Rere who did an amazing job. The food was a little more expensive than other options in the area but was amazing quality. 3 dishes and two drinks with the surcharges came to $36aud. Very cheap in comparison to the same quality food back home.

We had the pork chilli dumplings and oh my goodness, best dumplings I‚Äôve ever had. Hubby had the pork and rice and I don‚Äôt remember what mine was called but so delicious.  Great atmosphere. Check it out.","The food here is so tasty! We had a few variations of the wonton soup and they were all packed full of flavour. The staff are  really conscientious we had Christ, Itaa, Gaby and Charles. They gave us recommendations on the food and everything was brought to the table really quickly.
The prices here were very reasonable and the food is fresh and delicious!","Welcomed in with a smile, Dewi was very helpful with  choosing what to have.

The food itself was fantastic. You can choose your spice level depending how brave you are.

Perfect place for tourists who want to have a quiet room during the night sleep time.

You get much more than you pay.

I was here for 8 nights.","Although very cheap the rooms need more attention,(maintenance) linen was clean, but unfortunately the place is still very rundown. Pools looked clean and inviting, staff were very accommodating. Breakfast is a very basic buffet.","We spent the day here was amazing
They have 2 swimming polls.. (All huge)
The room with bathtub only at second floor
They don't have mineral water for guests who were staying at the hotel ü•≤
The staff is so friendly (not all staff) maybe because I am a local one (not bule)
But the breakfast was so cheap üòç 35k per person
My 2 children got free breakfast üç≥‚òïüçû
The spa is so cheap also . But always full booked
Maybe next day I will try the service spa on the salon-spa
Yes, high recommendation!
We will be back for sure","I have stayed in this establishment many many times but unfortunately, since the pandemic, it has gone downhill.  The staff are pleasant, as are all Balinese, the grounds are well kept and maintained but .... the room I was assigned this time ... well, I wouldn't let my dog stay there.   There was a putrid musky smell when I arrived, mould in the bathroom, no way would I have a bath in the bathtub, no hot water in vanity, toilet wouldn't flush properly, cabinet door off its hinges, the towels were grey and stained, the bed sheets grey and stained .....  it's a pity because this used to be a good place to stay.  Also, numerous other guests got sick after swimming in the front pool whist I was there and had to seek medical attention.","First impression absolutely negative. The room was not ready on time. I did ask them beforehand if I can check in earlier and never received a reply. But even by normal check in time of 2 pm the room was not ready and I had to wait like 30 minutes more. Can‚Äôt recommend.

Additionally, they have old building and new building. Old one has dusty, moldy rooms, with stained linen and towels, not working drains and most importantly faulty AC. I asked to resettle me to another room with a better working AC and they did that - the new building room had 2 single beds instead 1 queen bed but at least AC was cooling the room enough. However, the ceiling was leaking as hell during the rain, that much I had to put my towel underneath‚Ä¶"

Do not recommend this place in any way, shape or form! The only useful thing about this place was the boy who helped us take our bags to our room. I wish I could be nice with this review but I just can‚Äôt. After looking at 3 different rooms in total we found 1 that was decent enough but still not the rooms we paid for. Bring your own towels because they seem to not have enough for everyone including beach towel's to swim. 1 beach towel we got had blood on it. RANK! Mould in the bathroom. Bird poo all over the balcony. Doesn‚Äôt even look like it‚Äôs attempted to be cleaned. Breakfast was shocking, I wouldn‚Äôt even bother paying extra to have it included. The bathroom reeks of fish and the toilet doesn‚Äôt flush properly either. The doors are that brittle you could kick it down. The locks don‚Äôt even work properly and takes about 10 minutes to lock and unlock and that‚Äôs if it decides to work. By far the most disgusting hotel I‚Äôve stayed at and I highly recommend you do not stay here!! Save yourself the hassle and just book somewhere else!","Stayed 1 night before our flight home. Very old school Bali which is great. Fabulous location. But extremely run-down. Wifi slow, no shower pressure at all and bathrooms weren‚Äôt the cleanest (hello mould!), bath towels were dirty, and zero light in the rooms. With a bit of love without even doing a renovation, this hotel would be nice. Gardens are gorgeous however you can tell there is no upkeep. But I guess you get what you pay for. It‚Äôs cheap but wouldn‚Äôt go as far as saying value for money. Decent enough if you‚Äôre on a budget though.","Look, it is an old hotel. But everything cant be spanking new.
Position is in the middle of Legian and on the beach. Massive grounds and 2 huge pools.
Our room was older decor but we had good aircon, good bedding, fridge, kettle, water and a new loo. And hot, hot water. For $28 it was great and we will use again.","We always love staying at Melasti, as it‚Äôs very affordable, yet you get a spacious room with big comfy bed, nice swimming pools and private access to the Legian beach. There are many open spaces and greeneries, also a sufficient parking space. To the owner and the staffs, keep up the good work. These classic Balinese style hotel must be preserved and maintained.","A beachfront hotel and resort located in Legian, Kuta. The beach is just within walking distance. The building is a little bit old style (I booked standard room btw) but the environment and surroundings are  great. There are 2 big pools ( plus 1 small pool) and 2 restaurant bars. I think the maintenance, the amenities and the cleanliness could be improved."

Authentic yet all the modern facilities,' I needed anyway'. Quiet, calming grounds with lots of green canopy for cool shade. Large airconditioned rooms with large balcony/terrace, serviced daily. Elevator to 3 levels. Beautiful pool with full service. Great buffet breakfast. And..the most beautiful, friendly, happy staff. Thank you for a great stay. I would definitely book here again without hesitation.",5th time we have stayed here and if possible we will always stay at Kumala Pantai. Get the real Bali feel not like the usual hotel chains. Cannot knock the staff they are brilliant and highly recommend booking direct with hotel and if available you will get late check at 6pm.
