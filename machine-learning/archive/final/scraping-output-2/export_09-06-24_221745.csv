Such amazing value for money with some of the best service we have received. Staff go above and beyond. Welcome drinks a snack and hot cloth provided on arrival. You can pre order your dinner for whatever time you wish and I highly recommend eating here, either outside your room or down by the pool and sea watching the sun set. Breakfast included and delivered to your room. Room was big, clean and the sheets were fresh. Ample moped parking. And such comfy sun loungers! 10/10","The cottage is good, clean, and worth the money. It’s not a luxury like a hotel, but I enjoyed my 3 nights stay here. The beach is full of rocks and sometimes you can find corals or beautiful shells.","Absolutely amazing place full of peace and tranquility.  The service is incredible, you won't find such helpful staff.  I recommend it on a scooter.  You can take trips around the area and there is a lot to see!","Bali Cottage is a quiet and lovely place that's perfect if you want to relax. It's hidden away from all the noise and feels special, like a secret.

The rooms are very nice and the price is surprisingly low for what you get. What made our stay even better was the hotel manager. She was really kind and gave us free dessert and fish on our last two nights.

If you need to get away and enjoy some quiet time, this is a great spot. I almost don't want to tell people about it because it's such a great find.","Such a lovely place, little cottages with patios. All surrounded by green well kept garden and plants. There’s stepping stones to the pool which is right by the sea. You can have breakfast on a table right next to the sea or by your room. The room was very spacious, clean and bed was very comfy. The shower was hot and staff are friendly. I recommend."

All staff is so cute and friendly! I’m so happy that we decided to stay there. Tasty food… and the PRICE!,"An excellent resort, with very friendly and accommodating staff. You could not go wrong staying here with the incredible hospitality provided by Serly and the team. And for the price... a must visit!","A lovely new resort
Serly couldnt be a nicer manager.
The bungalows are all new, as is the whole resort.
A lovely place to stop over on the way to Amed or Singaraja.
Best of luck for this new resort."

I want to write something from our experience at Agung Bali Nirwana! We were there in November, 3 of us: me, my partner and he's son. We spent the most incredible 10 days of our trip to Indonesia and left very heavy hearted from there. Perfect living conditions with huge kitchen, living room, bedrooms and bathrooms. Everyday cleanup and wonderful staff. We made friends with the staff there and had the best trip advices from them. We jut had to express what we need and there it was, taking care of: motorbike rental, snorkelling equipment, travel possibilities to other beaches and places and many other services. We were picked up by the ferry and after our vacation had also a trip by car to the airport in Denpasar. The food was amazing, massages were good and all the activities made our stay a perfect relaxing vacation. The pool was great and the ocean was at our feet, perfect for snorkelling and i guess diving. Amazing sunrises and great atmosphere at the local ceremonies. The staff was always kind and smiling and very helpful. Thank you, dear friends for those beautiful days spent at the villa! Prise and quality = perfect match!","Third trip to Bali, second stay at ABN.
In a very positive way the villas, grounds and staff have changed very little since our last stay eight years ago. Considering ABN's seaside location, its quite remarkable how well maintained everything is and speaks volumes about the attention to detail management and staff provide.
If your looking for nightlife and nearby shopping this is not the place for you. If you want to experience Bali's tranquility, culture and unspoiled Coral reef, ABN is highly recommended.","Fantastic location. By far the best quality/price ratio in the neighborhood: calm, sun, food, sea, pool, massage, bats :) and staff.
Will be back without hesitation.",Great getaway villas good for small groups own pool and beach nearby. Accomodation clean and well kept and food good.,"Beautiful balance of privacy and personal care. Very tranquil. Perfection in the details. Amazing, the perfect place to relax (in paradise.)"
