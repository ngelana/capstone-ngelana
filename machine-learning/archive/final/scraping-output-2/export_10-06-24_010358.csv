1. The staff is awesome! From the moment you walk in, they remember your name throught your stay.

2. The hostel is social. Plenty of chances to exchange stories. Pub Crawl is super fun. And this is coming from a shy guy üòó

3. Lovely pool.

4. Lovely rooftop area. Small but offers a fantastic view of the beach.

5. Best rooms ever: These are the best dorm beds I‚Äôve ever found. Period! Beds are huge, have separate stairs to climb which is super convenient, and super clean.

6. Clean toilets - 24/7

7. Great prices - There are offers certain days a week. Pizza day is one of my favourite. Also, Pub Crawl is reasonable for the value you get.

8. Scooty prices are fine but they can work on their condition.

9. Best in class Co-Working Space: The area is nice chilled glass space with really high speed stable wifi with an unobstructed view of the pool. Working from here was a dream üòç

Overall this was a dream hostel to stay. Loved my time here. Wish to visit again üòâ","A place full of many extroverted guests and staff members.

Even if you‚Äôre not interested in the social scene, the staff make sure the common areas are all quiet by 2300. What made for the best experience with this hostel was by far the staff.. they were very attentive and went above and beyond for everything you needed."

Visited twice during my week in the area. Once for Sunday brunch (such lovely jazz music), another with friends for dinner.

For brunch, I ordered the boneless chicken leg: this is absolutely delectable. I think in the moment I called it the best chicken I've ever eaten. It's seasoned so incredibly well, so juicy and soft - it had me cleaning the plate with the rest of my mash.

For dinner, we ordered a lot. The main thing I want to note is their accommodation with my friend's nut allergy. They were thoughtful of this even in their complimentary dish ‚ù§Ô∏è So lovely to have this peace of mind.

Main dishes ordered: Seafood Arborio Risotto, Grilled Fillet Barramundi, Duck Leg Confit (our favourite by far), Chicken a'La Vanille (a lil dry; granted, our server warned us lol)

Sharing: Kahf cheese (loved this)

Dessert: Passion Fruit Pavlova

Drinks: Blue Dream tea, Butterfly Pea Flower tea, The Roots (my personal favourite)","Excellent dining experience. Lovely atmosphere and  very attentive staff. The food is fantastic, especially for the price you pay. Very high quality, delicious and well presented. We both had the grilled Barramundi and passion fruit pavlova, The kitchen were happy to substitute an ingredient so I could avoid coriander which the wait staff were extremely helpful with. Highly recommend.","The food is amazing. They have delicious vegetarian options and also other healthy options. All the food that we ordered are good, but the best is the pumpkin risotto and fried truffle polenta. Hummus is just so so, the blend is too thick and less tasty. But the rest is amazing.

It is also a good place to hang out to meet your friends just enjoy your brunch or maybe just grab some coffee after your pilates session. Their coffee is good too. Also if you're planning to chill and do your work, the ambience is pretty cool and there's plenty of space. For a coffee and croissant was around 100k, which is a reasonable price for a cafe. The staff were also excellent, attentive, and friendly to everyone.

We ordered the sweet corn tartlet, beef ragu arancini, pig cheek croquettes, prawn and warm polenta, roasted chicken. All the starters were creative and quite an explosion of flavours in the mouth. However, the main dishes that were supposed to be the highlights paled in comparison due to taste and textures. Really did not enjoy the cocktail i ordered too, it tasted like a bad mojito. Service was good, staff was attentive. Design and ambience of the space were on point (especially Further hotel). Not sure about the fan blowing in my face‚Ä¶but overall, it still deserves 4 stars.","Bar Vera emerges as a shining addition to the culinary scene in Parerenan, Bali. This establishment seamlessly blends Western (Australian-centric) cuisine with an enticing Asian flair, resulting in a menu that offers a delightful fusion of flavors.

The culinary offerings at Bar Vera are nothing short of impressive. From impeccable textures to precisely balanced temperatures and flavors, the dishes showcase a commitment to culinary excellence. The specials, in particular, stand out, presenting intriguing options that are undoubtedly worth exploring.

While the beverage selection is in ok level, I was surprise when they put corpse reviver cocktail on the menu, but turns out, they can‚Äôt make the real one but offers the other options to us.

However, it is evident that there is room for improvement in the service department. Staff training, especially in product knowledge, would greatly enhance the overall dining experience. A notable instance was when inquiring about ingredients aged for 12 months, receiving an inaccurate response regarding rice instead of the Comt√©.

In summary, Bar Vera delivers a delightful gastronomic experience with delicious offerings. While the service may benefit from refinement, the overall ambiance is undoubtedly inviting. A visit to Bar Vera promises a culinary journey that will leave patrons savoring the delightful fusion of flavors in a pleasant setting.","Everything on the menu is worth to try. We had the octopus, striploin, pommes and cabbage. Simple menus but they elevated on whole new level. The dessert banoffle souffle was theatrical and delicious.

One of the best, if not the best, vegan place I have eaten in Bali. The restaurant is beautiful, the staff is very friendly and attentive and the Food is sublime and very well presented. All fresh and tasty  10/10 I loved my experience with them and would repeat in fact I went for lunch and the next day for breakfast.","My plant power big breakfast was amazing! It is a bit more on the expensive side (215k for brekkie, tea and mineral water) but definitely worth it. Not only because the food is very high standard, the atmosphere is nice and the staff incredibly kind and hospitable. Def worth a detour if you are in the area!","So many vegan options! Super yummy. I went for dinner with my boyfriend. We had the curry with flatbread to share and then carrot as a side, the sandwich and rice cake. For dessert apple and coconut. Peaceful atmosphere, friendly service. Recommend it!",Perfect place to kick off our holiday. Food is delicious and fresh. I tried the watermelon ‚Äútuna‚Äù poke bowl and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. The flat bread and dips was also a hit. Staff were super friendly and attentive. The venue itself is striking. Would definitely return :)

The interior is cozy making it a perfect spot for a chill dinner with loved ones. Will definitely come back ","Being a huge Spanish food fan, I was practically bouncing with excitement when I stumbled upon Pescado the other day.  Let me tell you, it did NOT disappoint! Each dish was a revelation! We ordered a selection of tapas to share, and every single one was bursting with flavor.

And to top it all off, they even surprised us with a free drink!  That little touch of generosity just added to the overall positive experience.

Lets fiestaaaa!","I like üá™üá∏ food now after a visit to Pescado. I was expecting to have more of the burnt crust in the paella but they served a perfectly amount of it. I like burnt rice in üáÆüá© dishes too, I guess it‚Äôs universal haha.

The tuna tataki also great! Fish is fresh and the mashed potato is creamy. Will definitely visit again.","If you want to try paella and if you love seafood, you should visit Pescado in pererenan! I tried the croquettes, garlic prawns and cheesecake, which were all delicious.

They also have sangria promo on Thursdays for only 50k IDR.","The paella is the best at this Spanish restaurant in Bali. Every single tapas dish is also delicious. In addition, the staff are all incredibly friendly!"

The price is also affordable for everyone.

There is a nice ""Infinity Pool"" outside next to the bar.

MINUS:
The AC was very loud, at any speed and at night I had to turn it off because of that.

The location is not so ""wow"",so don't expect that everything is near you.","Amazing and friendly staff, comfortable rooms, the restaurant has the best fried rice, room service every day, little complimentary items when down by the pool provided by the wonderful staff, location is perfect and very close to delicious restaurants, fantastic shops and convenience stores.

The only small negative is it was very noisy at night, but this could have been the time of year we stayed (New Years Eve). Lots of other guests slamming their doors in the middle of the night - the front door to the rooms aren't soundproof.",Excellent hotel 5 min walk to beach and close to some amazing restaurants. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful breakfast was nice and pool temperature just right. The rooms were cozy and clean.Having room on 2nd floor provided us with small fully shaded balcony with comfortable bed/sofa to relax in full privacy.,"We are very enjoyed.
We had all you can eat promotion with 125++ but is so yummy .
With a good japanese food, small pool but so clean.
Staff was wonderfull, i have 5 start for this place, will happy to be here .

Will come back for food promotion .","I spent 8 days in this friendly Hotel and my experience was simply perfect. The location is perfect and food, staff, cleaness, price were really amazing.

My dish was an artful symphony of traditional Balinese flavors with a touch of modern innovation. The tender, perfectly cooked meat was complemented by a rich, savory sauce.  A vibrant salad brought freshness, while zesty lime added the perfect touch of brightness. Even the side vegetables were expertly prepared, showcasing their natural sweetness with a hint of enticing smokiness.  If you want to experience the essence of Balinese cuisine, a meal at Home by Chef Wayan is an absolute must.","What a gem! We found Home after finding that the chef was behind the food we had eaten on a live aboard boat. So for our last night in Bali we had to try it out.
It‚Äôs definitely off the main drag of Canggu and well worth jumping in a Grab to eat here.
Simply furnished with outdoor and indoor seating you could feel the love from the first step.
The food is a modern take on Indonesian whilst keeping with the delicious fresh tastes we love.
We enjoyed so many dishes it‚Äôs hard to choose a favourite but it must be said it‚Äôs the best rendang we have had! The duck breast was so so tender, the sates had been properly grilled with a house made sauce.
The sambals are all made freshly which really adds to the flavours.
There is an extensive cocktail list and they too are well made and delicious
Do yourself a favour and come here you won‚Äôt regret it! .","This restaurant wins my ‚ÄòFavourite Food‚Äô Award in Bali during the last 6 weeks of travel! I tried the Tempe Bakar and Holy Moley it was OUTSTANDING (even came back to have it again haha) and on my second visit was lucky enough to meet Chef Wayan himself, what a lovely lovely human!

The Black Rice Pudding is an absolute MUST as well!

Don‚Äôt miss a visit to this absolute gem in Pererenan. üôå","Had dinner her with my fiance and it didn't disappoint. The atmosphere is nice even though the place is outdoor the staff is very friendly and helpfull. All the mains here come with rice but we decided to not take the rice and they were kindly enough to offer us to change the rice with sautee vegetable.
The grilled octopus we had a little bit overcooked and the sambal can be too spicy for some people, the ledok nusa is out of this world. The creaminess of the potato and coconut milk balanced by the punch from the sambal and bawang goreng, this is my first time trying ledok nusa and what a introduction it is.","So cozy and delicious food! Thank you to the lovely staff who made me feel like HOME. Got to have dinner with a book full of photos of Bali, enjoyed a very tasty and warm meal. I almost end up having dinner at a very fancy restaurant nearby but I knew I wanted something that felt like it was made with love and intention. And it was! Thank you!!"

While the surroundings offer an incredible selection of restaurants and coffee shops, to which the staff will kindly drive you with their buggy, one could just stay at La Reserve, as the food and drinks are excellent. We cannot recommend La Reserve strongly enough and we will certainly be back!","Excellent boutique hotel,
The room is amazing. We had the villa with private pool, and filled with a lot of details, nice furniture, and well equipped, with its own personality. Access to the private pool from the room and shower area to give you full privacy and offers to have a dip whenever you feel like.
Staff are excellent, always helpful and doing all extra steps to make your stay as smooth and as amazing as possible. Arranging the spa booking, recommending restaurants around, and dropping us to the nearby beach.
Spa was really good and manage to go back few times during our stay.
Restaurant is amazing and the dish from the breakfast menu was beyond our expectation.  Nicely platted, and generous

With limited rooms, you won‚Äôt feel staying in a crowded place, and feel like on paradise

Overall it was an excellent experience, and the best place to relax. We would come back again","This is one of the great places to stay. The decor is stunning. The attention to detail flawless. The staff super-attentive without ever being over-bearing. And, when you do leave to go out locally, the golf cart whisks you anywhere you desire and picks you up. This really is what clever indulgence feels like.","Absolutely Fabulous on all levels.  The hotel is like a sanctuary with limited rooms, beautiful gardens, reception and dining spaces all exquisitely designed and decorated with unique and stunning furnishings.  The incredible staff go above and beyond to make your stay a standout and special experience.
The Rooms are amazing - we had the private pool pavilion rooms which was wonderful and so well appointed with everything you could need during your stay - soft fluffy towels and and soft comfy bed linens ....
The Food was delicious- the breakfasts are an occasion with many options to choose from, fresh fruits,  juices and pastries are all so beautifully presented and tasty.
We will definitely be back as we have only been home a week and I wish I was back there :).","We‚Äôve been to Bali around 5 times, and this was definitely one of the best we‚Äôve ever experienced. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They offer free buggy pick ups that take you to restaurants and places nearby, which is really convenient for tourists like us. The breakfast is French style and delicious. The villa has a retro-French vibe, which is very beautiful and stands out from the other resorts. We also love the small pool in the villa, it‚Äôs clean and private. Would highly recommend to couples or friends who are looking for an exquisite experience in Canggu."

ALi has landed all the way from Australia, bringing with it a blend of coffee culture and brunch delights. The surroundings are still deep in the throes of construction, so visitors should brace themselves for a bit of noise and dust from the ongoing developments on either side and across the street. Parking can also be a bit of a headache, so plan accordingly.

Upon arrival, the sleek and aesthetically pleasing exterior of ST. ALi is sure to catch your eye, although it may not immediately evoke the traditional Balinese vibe. Instead, it stands out with its modern charm and inviting facade.

Inside, the cafe was buzzing with activity, a testament to its newfound popularity. The design is a delightful fusion of Japanese minimalism and retro rustic elements, creating a cozy yet chic atmosphere perfect for a leisurely brunch or a quick coffee break.

Speaking of coffee, this is where expectations might need a slight adjustment. Despite the buzz surrounding its opening, the coffee here didn't quite hit the mark for me‚Äîit leaned a bit on the weaker side. However, the food more than made up for it. The Ali Smash has quickly become a favorite, offering a delectable mix of flavors that left a lasting impression.

The menu offers more than just coffee, with a range of cocktails and full brunch options that cater to different tastes. It's clear that ST. ALi is more than just a coffee shop; it's a vibrant spot for socializing and enjoying a hearty meal.

While it‚Äôs currently bustling with curious patrons and the atmosphere is lively, ST. ALi is a solid option for those in the neighborhood. Whether you‚Äôre in for a quick coffee or a full brunch experience, it‚Äôs a place worth checking out amidst the evolving landscape of Pererenan.","Here around 4PM and it was nice, no queue. Wanted a cup of coffee after meal, and got a cup of latte. The coffee is weaker compared to what I had in Oz, but it‚Äôs still smooth and okay. The staff was nice and accommodating. Pet friendly, so you can bring your dogs! üêï parking is available for bikes.","New kid on the block by the people behind further hotel, bringing the famous Australian cafe to Bali‚Äôs shore.

The same delicious coffee can be found here along with their merch, coffee capsules, beans and more.

Fries were absolutely delicious!!","I was so excited to visit here, but when I got my food that I ordered, I was disappointed.
The coffee was so weak, even though I ordered a size up.(So I thought I had only ordered one shot. Even though the price is same to the cafe in AU!!) But okay, that's fine.
But the food made me so disappointed. I don‚Äôt know how to cook the meat like this... I tried to eat it but I couldn‚Äôt. Even the pancakes were not good as well... that‚Äôs the first time I gave up on eating my pancakes.

Sorry to say that I was disappointed. Usually, I don‚Äôt write bad reviews for businesses, but I hope that my review will help your business improve.","It's one of Bali's most beautiful cafes in my opinion. The place is amazing, the architecture is totally trendy and instagram focused, and the branding is great. The drink and the food were really good as well. Glad to comeback here for next holiday."

The yoga is great and only place that I know offers hot yoga.  But I‚Äôve recently learned to really enjoy the high internist training in a hot room.  It‚Äôs intense and a great workout.  I originally came for bikrim hot yoga but found HIT to be addictive.  Also took vinyasa classes and found them to be outstanding.  So this is my new favorite yoga place in the canggu area. I will say it is outstanding and you will have discovered a gem if you came to try it.  Look for me the sweaty old dude!!!!
