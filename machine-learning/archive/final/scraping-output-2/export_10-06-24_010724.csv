The best menu is bebek I think. Last visit, I ate bebek penyet, including kangkung goreng. That's the best! You must try it. They give you 2 choices of sambal, the red and green one. The red one is spicier.

While the prices were considered cheap compared to Jakarta, the overall experience left me with mixed feelings. Perhaps my expectations were too high, as the food turned out to be just average.

The long queues were a drawback, making the wait feel less worthwhile.

The ati and ampela satay isn't eatable at all. The rice is a small portion for the price and although we have to order it separately from the duck dish, they serve them on one plate.

She went red then walked away, another one came to take my order. My friend arrived a few minutes late and we have to call the waitress to bring another menu.

Denpasar Bar., Kota Denpasar, Bali 80119, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=5238033455681162688,OPERATIONAL,+62 811-3920-507,indonesian_restaurant,"indonesian_restaurant, restaurant, food",4.5,493,PRICE_LEVEL_INEXPENSIVE,"Used the delivery app to order this, taste good, the sate lidah (ox tongue skewers) for me is a musy.","New place for me and my fam when we want to eat Satay Padang
Found this place when my son want to try Satay Padang,so i used Gr*b food apps to search and decided to order from this stall
And it‚Äôs a success we all love the sauce and the satay was really tender
Decided to visit the stall last week,not too big but it‚Äôa clean
Ordered more dishes compared to the first time i ordered through apps,it‚Äôs all good except the beef satay
This time the beef satay is too dry and tough,my wife didn‚Äôt like it so she order chicken satay
And the beef satay is one of the most expensive menu here,so it‚Äôs should be the main star
Hopefully they can improve it,since the other menu is really good",Every bite i take remind me of my hometown satay. This is the one place that you looking if you wanted to eat sate/satay from west sumatera. With the yellow/green secret spicy sauce pair with the thick juicy ketupat. Taste like heaven. Kinda pricey for indonesian food but worth every penny,"Came here cause I wanted to eat Sate Padang but surprised to see that also serve Soto Padang and also Lontong Sayur Padang.

Me and my friend eventually tried the Soto and Lontong. The taste was okay but not something  ""memorable"" for me. Want I love is that they do offer various Padangnese dishes, drinks and also thw  ussual condiments like kerupuk ""Jangek""

I will surely come back to this restaurant if I have a longing for Padang dishes

The place is not big so I think the appropriate word to call this place is a ""warung"" it does have some quirky and unique decoration though","The best sate padang in Bali (so far).. This is what happens when a real Padangnese sells sate padang... Many acclaims ""sate Padang"" in Bali, but none of them taste this good. The price of the food is affordable and they offered many food options. I cant say that the food is pricey but the taste is equal to its pricing. Hope you guys will survive this pandemic and keep on going and serving the best sate padang!"
