Been here several times since my dad lives nearby, and this place is one of his recommendations.
Ask for the recommended fish for grilled or fried from the waitress, and try the grilled tempe.",There are few choice of restaurants in North Bali. This warung Muslim Pak haji could be one of the best you can find. Plenty of choice in menu. Economic price. Taste is good. Unfortunately the place is not big enough for large group.,The place can be dark and have flys but the fish is grilled in a special genius way with honey sauce and its just a must try. We went back and chose the mahi mahi and also had waterspinach and sambal as sidedish. You can reject the big ricepot you get served without  comment if you want a smaller portion. I recommend take away 1 grilled fish per person and available side dishes,"The best seafood restaurant in Pemuteran, my favourite is grill fish, eggplant and tofu! The taste is delicious and the price is affordable! Thank youu Ibu Haji.. üôèü§ó","Fish soup and grilled fish are the best
Don't forget to try grilled tempe üëçüëç"

The pool is an eye-catcher, warm with thermal water, very large, with comfortable beds, umbrellas and towels always available.  There is a bar in the middle where you can drink directly from inside the pool.  The Jacuzzi is nice but not very powerful.  The rooms are nice and spacious, clean and comfortable.  The bathroom is personal on the outside and is fantastic!  The staff is exceptional, I can't wait to go back!","It's 2 years since I fell in love with Kinrara resort. The location was superb,  breakfast was without doubt the finest I'd had. But for me the holiday we had was made because of the wonderful staff employed here.
Yes its a bit of a drive from the airport,  about 3 hours, however its worth every bump in the road to sit and relax in the pool. And don't even get me started on the outside showers. (Loved them )
I can't recommend this hotel enough..","Location, location, location...

Kinaara looks lovely the moment you get there. Staff is very helpful with your suitcases and check in was fast. You are offered a small welcome drink during check in.
The room was clean an quite spacious, but it is made completely out of bamboo. This looks characteristic, but has a few drawbacks. You can hear everything that happens outside, so if your neighbor sneezes, you will hear it. The main road in front of the hotel also makes for quite some noise, but the worst part were the local mosques. Every morning around 5 the would start a 1 hour screaming match that woke me every morning and the same goes for the evening between 7 and 10. Another disadvantage of the bamboo is that there are little gaps, so insects can get in by accident. Also, there were very few power sockets, so you will have to choose between having you light at the night stand or charging your phone at night. The beds were also quite hard and not to my liking.
The outdoor bathroom however was very nice. There is a sink, toilet and a very nice shower available. The bathroom is walled, so privacy is good.
The pool is great and compared to other places it is warm. The beds around the pool have beach umbrellas and the little bar (that also has seats in the water) make it a very good place to spend a day.
There seem to be no taxis in Pemuteran and the resort is on the outskirts of the town, so walking anywhere can take you 15-25 minutes. The town itself though has some nice little restaurants and good dive centers.
In all fairness, the hotel itself is great. If this hotel was situated in a more quiet area, I would have given it 5 stars. But the poor sleep I had gotten there due to the noisiness and hard beds, can only be rewarded with 3.","The location is good, not on the beach, but still very quiet and tranquil. The pool is AMAZING! Heated, with a swim-up bar. The bar staff are great, and they offer a very wide range of cocktails. The restaurant has wonderful food and attentive staff. And the spa offers great services at a good price. They even offer an after diving package, which was very relaxing and rejuvinating after a day spent SCUBA diving.","Lovely grounds, awesome warm giant pool with swim-up bar, nice villas. Sweet staff. 1/2 board with very good food and lovely restaurant. Noise from roosters, dogs and nearby mosque. A bit of a walk from town and not near the beach. They have a great spa."
