Mr Wayan Pica took care of us and led us for a 2 hours visit throughout this great place, built and lived by the local community in order to share with the world the uniqueness of Bali culture. A very special gem that every tourist in Bali should visit to understand its culture and the kind heart of the local people. Great attention to detail and interactive activities that warm your heart. They even offer you coffee and a delicious sweet sneak! The guide is ready to answer to all your questions and tell you local stories while also exchanging knowledge in order to enhance the sustainability of their offer!!!
Thank you so much, this place will stay in our heart!!!","This place is a great way to learn more about local culture, believes and meet some extremely hospitable people that care to preserve local traditions and explain them to the visitors. It is not so well known, so, not many people visit it during the day, but we found it special and enjoyed the experience a lot. The place is established and run by community members. The guide brings you through different stations that allow to discover different elements of Balinese everyday life and traditions.
Moreover, the area they created is impressive, a cosy and beautiful garden with traditional buildings made of natural materials. The Balinese traditional culture is a great example of sustainability combined with an outstanding esthetics and harmony.
We recommend this place to everyone who cares about local culture.","Great and calm place to learn about local people and coulture in Bali. Wayan is super nice, he was teaching us so many great things. The exhibition is really interesting and the home made coffe, sweet potato cake and arak is delicious! :) Must visit if you are in Sidemen!","We found the museum accidentally, but it was a really great experience. Itâ€™s nice that local community built this museum to preserve local culture and they try to not use plastics. The spoons of snacks are made by palm leavesðŸŒ¿ we can try different musical instruments and local alcohol. I
The best is that a girl wrote my name on palm leaf with Balinese writing system. The manager was very patient and kind. It was a great opportunity to learn some Balinese culture.","If you are looking for authentic cultural experience in Bali , this is for you! Itâ€™s a village-owned, locally-run place started to protect the local traditions and is integrated into their community space nicely.

Come here to enjoy the traditional cooking , Bali instrument, local dessert and coffee. The staff was very friendly too ðŸ˜Š Definitely worth a visit!"

It is worth a short break while on the drive and the views will anyways arrest you, even if this wasn't your destination. But maybe don't drive all the way just for it.

On the day of my visit, the little cute cafÃ© nearby was closed.","This place is truly stunning, so calm, peaceful and picturesque. When I was there, there was literally one other person, it was nice to explore the place (almost) to myself.

Only thing missing on the walking path was a bench, it would have been nice to have somewhere to sit as I absorbed the beauty around me.",Great view ! No parking - stay on the road,Really beautiful rice terrace that we stopped at on the way back to Ubud. Highly recommend
