We were very surprised because of the rating, and we actually only came for the pottery, which was also very good! Highly recommended!
But the food!! I had the lasagna, and we had the foccacia with Hummus, babaganoush, and labne combined with the herbsauce from  the k√ºfte was sooo good, also the desert, chocolate tarte and strawberry tarte with coffe was really amazing, we totally loved it!! üíõ","Hands down the best place for food in ubud. We went there for breakfast one day, the coffee was perfect.

We also went back for dinner and it was a standout, the food was exceptional. We had drinks at sunset and the staff were really friendly and chatty.

Best dinner we‚Äôve had in Bali !!","Went here for a pottery workshop, it was fun and easy to understand for a first timer. Knowledgeable host make it easier to understand about the workshop.

Lunch also had amazing taste, poke bowl with superb wasabi. Huge portion which also a plus point.

The biggest turn down was the black coffee, dark, bitter and when it gets warm it tasted unpleasant. Probably suitable for people who likes their coffee dark and bitter.",Went here because wanted to have a morning coffee only. Ended up staying until afternoon to have lunch. The place is super comfortable for a good talk. It's quiet and beautiful Rice field. Large parking space which i didn't often find in Ubud's coffee and eatery place. It has both indoor and outdoor space and very spacious,"Amazing space and ambience, friendly and professional staff and both the food menu and bakery are amaaaaazing. My favorite place when I‚Äôm in Ubud. It‚Äôs suitable as both a working space or coffee date in day time, or a fancy dinner at night. You‚Äôre missing out if you haven‚Äôt been here"

The location is fabulous. You can get around easily with a taxi, which is cheap. There is a supermarket nearby with all you may need. The pool is beautiful and inviting and the whole place has a wonderful sense of calm.
I was very happy with my stay and I will go back!!! Thank you awesome staff for making my dream holiday","We had a beautiful stay with our group. It‚Äôs located a bit outside of Ubud, which was perfectly quiet. The staff is super friendly. We highly recommend this beautiful place üôèüèª","Great stay, rooms clean, views are amazing. Abit far from central ubud and busy streets but the place offer bike rental or cheaper option 10 minute walk. Very relaxing off grid location","Wadari Retreat is a fantastic place to wind down for quiet-loving families like ours. Our room was generous in space with a kitchen corner to boot. The view of the greenery from our room was breathtaking and picture-perfect!

We were fans of the outdoor pool and the restaurant area that offered stunning panoramic views of the sunset over what should be beautiful rice terraces during the peak season.

The on-site spa treatments available were top-notch and our day ended perfectly with a delicious, reasonably priced meal at the restaurant. Fun fact: they also offer cooking classes!

Despite being tucked away from the hustle-bustle, it's just a 20-minute drive from Ubud center. If you fancy a stroll, there's a well-stocked Pepito supermarket nearby. For families seeking peace and comfort, we can't recommend Wadari Retreat enough.","Our family of four found serenity at Wadari Retreat, Ubud. With its peaceful setting in what at the right time of year would be lush green rice fields, it provided the tranquility we needed. What we liked the most about our spacious room was the pantry. It had everything required for a quick snack after a tiring day of exploration.

Speaking of exploration, the complimentary bikes were a real treat! We set off on an adventure finding ourselves in Ubud town just about 20 minutes later. But, if you ask us, our days concluded best at the restaurant. Dining with a view of the sunset over the fields and a reasonably priced menu - magnificent!

Pro tip: There's a neat caf√© nearby and a Pepito supermarket, which is super handy!"

It‚Äôs a must go to if you‚Äôre in Ubud!","FARM has the most delicious vegan Doner in a lovely, simple setting... Try their signature Farm Iced Tea, too - it's cool and refreshing with a limey-lemongrass twist! Best of all... It's all cultivated, nurtured and harvested from the view right in front of you! A cheaper low-key local alternative to the bustling nearby Rusters. Luckily they have their own garden buffer to maintain a bit of their view in the face of yet another block development which has razed the land just beyond the garden wall!","Last week- I came back to try their food here and the vibe is not the same anymore, not the same staff. Just like any other places here. The food on their list is mostly fried though ""organic"". I hope they can revive the old good vibe here. Before they even have breakfast menu and buffet. But now, for some reason I dont like the food they offer. Its just looks unhealthy to me. I ordered french fries and I didnt like it. I also feel like the staff are just there for work. I dont feel the good vibe from them.

2 yrs ago-
They have vegan buffet by donation! first time I heard of that here and it comes with a refreshing home made iced tea. The staff are super friendly, they chat with us many times unlike in other cafe/restaurant. I do love the energy in this place and we got stranded here due to heavy rain, but we never felt intimidated to stay, they even gave us blanket since its cold. I highly recommend this place!!!","The best moment of our visit was the sigh of disappointment heaved by a group of ladies at the realisaiton that the menu is all vegan. They promptly left looking for something that suffered before they could eat it. üôÉ

üåØ The menu is small and composed of vegan and freshly-made renditions of fast-foody dishes: nuggets, burgers, fries, donner kebab. There are two or so desserts and several drinks.

The portrayal of portions on the pictures underestimates reality. ü§© What looked like a small burger sandwich was an actual large burger! Everything fresh and crispy from the bun, to the cucumbers, to the soya chunks. Even the ketchup and mayonnaise felt crispy fresh. üòã

The hot lemongrass and lime drink was amazing too, with a whole chunk of lemongrass to stir it.

üå± A stroll around the fruit & veg garden is just *one* sales point of the place, but the bigger one is the trampoline and the slide which can cater to adults too. Trust me, I checked, while making friends with someone's kid. I hope to one day fulfil theI promise of going on a slide with them again in the future.","Unreal daily vegan Balinese style buffet! 5-8pm all you can eat for a very decent price, texture and flavors were delicious, good variety of dishes, with veggies partially grown on their own farm downstairs, so it‚Äôs super fresh and packed with all the good stuff. I arrived early and witnessed with how much love and care the buffet was set up and then blessed üòá with chefs and all staff members! Many of the guests also ordered THE original Doner Kebab (yes, the quarter Turkish flat bread style Berlin kebab ü§§) Management was there and super attentive and explained the tradition of blessings and some of the dishes. Kid and dog friendly too.( Also got a playground in the back) Nice breeze and views overlooking the gardens and farm. It‚Äôs a MUST."

I mean, what are the chances that you can find fresh, handcrafted authentic Italian pasta in an unassuming, unpretentious environment in Bali?

Very recommended when visiting around Ubud.,"We‚Äôve visited Pasta di Marco multiple times since discovering it, and our admiration knows no bounds. As an Italian, along with my girlfriend, both seasoned professionals in high-end luxury hospitality in the F&B sector, I can confidently attest to the exceptional quality and freshness of the pasta and sauces ‚Äì truly top-notch. Ordering certain items abroad can be worrisome, but Pasta di Marco consistently surpasses expectations.

The unique feature of choosing and mixing pasta types and shapes with preferred sauces is a delightful touch. Their selection of stuffed ravioli, agnolotti, and lasagna, each with various variations, caters to a diverse palate. Additionally, the takeout option, whether pre-cooked by the chef or raw for home preparation, adds to the culinary flexibility.

I must commend Marco, the owner, often present, tirelessly supporting his team with a contagious smile. He embodies true hospitality, humility, and dedication, showcasing a genuine love for Bali and profound respect for it. Such individuals, with a genuine commitment to the local community, are a welcome addition to this sanctuary.

Ordered the set menus of pork and saba, and enjoyed the experience. Both main dishes were quite tasty for the genre, and side dishes were generous. Ingredients feel pretty fresh and high quality, with organic rice, home-made miso, and good natto. Drink selections were pretty good, and price was reasonable.
