Perfect for Couples, Families or Group of Friends, as well as Wedding Venue :)!!","There was absolutely nothing to do in the area, and the place was very far from any city or attraction. The opportunities provided by the resort were not easily accessible due to how far of a drive it is to any attraction. This place would be great if you are just looking to hang on the resort, but note that their food was not very good either. If you are comfortable with sub-par and overpriced food to sacrifice for the beautiful view this place is for you. We were the only people staying there at the time which gave the place an eerie feeling. It was weird to us that no one was at the resort as we were staying during the busy season. Most other hotels were completely booked. Also, they use an iPad system to order food and no one answered our orders or requests. Luckily I caught one of the staff walking outside after an hour of waiting, only to find out they did not see our order. They were pleasant enough to refund us for our cancelled nights stay as we ended up leaving two nights early. For this, I have updated my review to two stars. In response to their reply, I will still give you two stars because the food was not acceptable for the price and your location is too far from any other source to go get food. We are not picky eaters, and love all types of food (especially many of the locally sourced meals we had at other locations). It also seems as though I am far from the only one with these complaints so I feel justified in my review. I wish you the best of luck in your development.","This place is absolutely incredible. We just spent a week here for our honeymoon and we couldn't have asked for anything better. The entire staff is so kind, gracious and willing to go above and beyond what is expected. The villa was absolutely perfect. The private pool overlooks the rice fields, it is incredibly peaceful and private. The food is so delicious at the restaurant, everything we had was terrific. There wasnt one item on the menu that we didn't like. The aesthetic of the resort is so peaceful and calm you cant help but be relaxed the entire time you're there. We did a lot of activities offered by the resort including two day trips, a cooking class, renting a motorbike to explore the local area, multiple massages, and a yoga class. They all exceeded expectations. The cooking and yoga classes were just my husband, myself and the instructors. It was amazing having the one on one instruction and intimacy, that you cant get in the more tourist areas. If you are considering staying here please dont hesitate, you will not be disappointed by anything. If you want an authentic Balinese experience, you will get it here. We will definitely be back to Alami!","This place has been a lot more than we hoped for. The food and service are amazing.
The place itself is quite far from everything but a great spot for weddings, family gatherings or simply some quiet time.
The view over the rice fields is just gorgeous and the rooms a in a very good state, offering villas for 4, 6, 8 and even 12 people.

The BBQ they offer here for 450k per person is very nicely prepared and worth the money you pay. If I had to change anything it might be the internet speed and the occasional insect crawling around, but the staff will help you with that too ^^

They offer bikes and lots of activities if you are inclined to do something outside your villa. Did I mention that this is also a drone friendly place? Highly recommended","Most beautiful villas in Tabanan. Just loved the villas surrounded by nature. Its cozy atmosphere, perfect spending time with your family, children can enjoy the pool. Or just simply relax with your beloved one and admire  the sunset over beautiful rice field"
