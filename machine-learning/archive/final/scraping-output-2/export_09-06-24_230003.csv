Baturiti, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82191, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=15950651947470591079,OPERATIONAL,+62 368 21407,health,"tourist_attraction, church, health, place_of_worship",4.7,480,,"I think this is one of some places you should visit among other Christian holly places in Bali. It was lovely to find a quiet haven that was free to visit and spend time in.

If you are visiting St Yoseph Karmel chapel then The Virgin Mary cave is just very short walk away. It is literally small cave with a peaceful atmosphere. The whole experience was so spiritual and uplifting and gave me a moment of clarity. Spending time with the Holy Mother is well worth the visit.

I recommend going very early in the morning as the crowds were just getting thick as I walked up.","This place is belong to O,Carm Congregation. One of catholic ordo in Indonesia.
So cool place...quite, fresh air, nice food, and they also have Indonesian Wine from Singaraja Grapes. This is the right place for meditation and healing.","Thich Nhat Hanh in his book 'Living Buddha, Living Christ' once quoted Thomas Merton's ""A monastery or practice center is a place where insight is transformed into action"". Thich further wrote ""when someone  from the city arrives in monastery compound,  just seeing the trees and gardens and hearing the sound of the bell can calm him down"".

That is exactly what I felt about this place. I happened to stay in a lower ground house and I had to walk upstairs. It was quite a tiring walk, yet I tried to do it mindfully. The garden offers you a sense of tranquility, suddenly you're in a different world although you're still in Bali.

The food was great. It was not overwhelmingly tasty, but it wasn't bland either. Try to do everything mindfully here. Enjoy your walk, enjoy the prayer both in group and in solitude. Enjoy the scenery, and on top of that, be thankful for every breath.

It is at this moment that Sleeping At Last's song 'Saturn' comes to mind -  ""How rare and beautiful it is to even exist"".","A retreat located in hilly slope of Baturiti, just Bedugul neighbourhood, A warm and sacred place to refresh and worship, as well. Especially to Mother Mary. A simple resort or hut available to be rent.","Quite and peaceful place to do meditation, retreat and praying. Surrounded by fresh air in local Balinese village. Their home-made wine is worth to try."
