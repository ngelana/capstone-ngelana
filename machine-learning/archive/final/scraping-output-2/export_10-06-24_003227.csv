The views are out of this world and we have never seen such an amazing sunrise. Stayed at both the Bamboo House and the Rampage House and both are wonderful in their own way, super cool architecture and all very sustainable since they work with a lot of recycled materials. The environment is very peaceful as you have the hill for yourself and stay in the jungle. Hosts Ketut, Ketut and Nova are super kind and helpful, prepare a tasty dinner and breakfast and are also able to provide a Balinese cookingclass. Must go in Sidemen!","That was probably the best experience during our one-month stay in Bali. We visited plenty of beautiful luxury resorts, villas, and hotels, but to stay at this wonderful bamboo villa was something else!

We slept and woke up with the sound of birds and beautiful creatures, nature was truly incredible and the sunrise view took our breath away!

WE JUST CAN'T RECOMMEND STAYING HERE ENOUGH! It was a fairytale even for one night...we felt so disconnected from the noise and rush and so connected with Mother Nature. Couldn't get better!

The villa has 2 bedrooms - one is better to relax and watch the beautiful sunrise - definitely recommend waking up for it! We slept in the other one with a bigger bed and protecting nest, but the most interesting part was - they were no mosquitos at all and no monkeys! Only the birds!

The owners of this beautiful house are a lovely local family and were the most helpful and kindest people in the world! They cooked us dinner and breakfast and assisted us with renting a bike and helped us with our luggage up and down the hill by taking it on their motorbikes and also escorted us down to the village which was only about 5-minute ride with the bike. The taxi was waiting for us there to pick us up. Truly a different and memorable experience that you need to try and feel by yourself!","AMAZING! Katut and Nova are the most friendly and accommodating hosts, we didn‚Äôt want to leave! The views and house itself is breathtaking but more than that, the friendliness we experienced made this stay so magical. I would highly recommend.","Amazing place , absolutely the best experience we had in sidemen.
The places is just incredible.
The most friendly host I ever had.
We talked with him about everything.
There dinner and breakfast is also very good and with the view of the mountain sunrise made it perfect.","We had a lovely stay at the Birdhills Bamboo villa. It is surrounded by nature and has a stunning view. Especially the sunrises from the balcony of the villa were magical. The staff is super friendly and took great care of us. They organized breakfast and dinner for us and made us feel at home. The villa has a little kitchen and dinnertable, a huge bed which was extremly comfortable and a outdoor bathroom and shower. We can highly recommend this place if you like to relax and make a real, local Bali experience because this house is not located in a touristy area. East Bali has a lot to offer, which is off the beaten path, what we loved."

Tucked away in lush greenery on top of a hill with the most beautiful sunrise lookout. The bathrooms and food could have slight room for improvement but it is a more rustic experience so to be expected. Very friendly staff who really went out of their way to make our experience memorable (especially Windu). Thank you TAG!,"We had an amazing time here. Windo and his family made our time a great stay. The view is so beautifully, the pancake is one of the best we had. But in our 3 day stay, we couldn‚Äôt sleep. It is in the middle of the jungle and we had issues with the early chicken and the frogs in the pond in front of our bungalow.","Really great and unique stay near Sidemen. The view is incredible, especially at sunrise. Also did a (private) yoga class in the morning which was a nice experience. The staff is really nice and sincerely interested in your trip. Only thing I missed was a sink in the room with a mirror on eye level, but of course its still clamping :)","We booked for two nights but stayed for only one. The views are amazing but getting here is tough. This place is far off from main sidemen area with limited transport. To get here you need to climb 200-300 stairs. Its on a hilltop and not accessible by car directly. The hosts are good and they wilp help you carry your luggage over to the top.
We stayed in the moon glamping. The room was basic but clean. No hot water for shower was a big let down. They do not have air conditioning in any of their room and some rooms dont even have attached bathrooms. The climate was cold enough so we didnt need an AC.
However, the host Windu and his family are very polite and helpful. The food they served was delicious. I will remember this place for the best banana pancake ever.","Highest recommendation if you're fine with basic rooms. All clean and fresh. Amazing views and great energy. Such a lovely place to stay. And the owner and stuff ate suuuper sweet and friendly.
He even made me a vegan pancake for breakfast, flexible checkout time and just great place and people.
Will comeback for sure üëç"

If you don‚Äôt like touristy stuff here you can cook with two cool Balinese guys in the jungle, using traditional methods like wood fire and mortar. Keep in mind that it‚Äôs a bit hard to find the location.","We had an amazing time with Ketut, learning to cook some Balinese dishes. The location is beyond spectacular, nestled on the side of a mountain. We cooked a number of different dishes, all of which were delicious and Ketut ran us through each ingredient, which was insightful, and tailored the dishes to our liking. We leave today with the ability to go home and recreate some delicious food, and reminisce about a fabulous day! Highly recommend this activity if you have the chance.","Really great experience, it was soooo good ! We meet Ketut with his family, it was a nice moment to share.","Great atmosphere, super tasty results! Authentic Balinese experience.

All ingredients were local and fresh. In just below 3 hours we made 4 dishes and a dessert. We were using traditional and authentic knives and tableware which was really cool. There were some vegetarian alternatives as well! Host and the team were kind and open people, speaking decent english. We had a great time!"
