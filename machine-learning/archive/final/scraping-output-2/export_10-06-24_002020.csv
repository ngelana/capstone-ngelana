The staff are super friendly and helpful to ensure our stay was memorable.

The views from the room and pool are just simply stunning and probably one of the best views that you will get of Mount Agung if the weather is desirable. Our stay came with free breakfast that we could even order to our room and pool üòç, plus 20 minute free foot massage!

The only negative is that it's really secluded and there isn't much to do around here. If you need that, best to rent a motorbike to explore Sidemen.

Fantastic stay overall and would highly recommend!","Imagine paradise, and that's pretty much what you'll experience. Amazing staff, food was good too. A spa day is a must just for the view alone.","Best view from our room, the rooms are nice and comfortable, the surroundings are very quiet plus the sounds of nature. friendly service, strategic location if you want to go to other sidemen areas.","Incredible view from the houses and pool side.
There staff was very nice and polite.
To the Cocktail lovers: We got some amazing freestyle Cocktails mixed, based on the ingredients we like or got recommended.","This is hands down the most beautiful place I've ever stayed in and the most beautiful natural view I've ever seen. It's lovely. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The restaurant is very good. The hotel offers free hikes in the morning. And if it's good enough for David Bowie, it's good enough for me.

The mosquito nets are a bit small and tight around the small bed, which is probably our only criticism of the place."

There‚Äôs a little park right next to the first building of the little village which is comfortable to walk down. View is impressive. Great spot for a little break but you‚Äôll not need a lot of time,"I‚Äôm not quite sure if we‚Äôre allow to come to this place, as we founded (quite late) that this is government private area and we will get fine or arrested

If any local people around here and willing to added information , can we visit this or not.

Beautiful mistake",We parked next to the road and walked down. Very hidden but beautiful spot.,really cool spot.,Realy nice
