We stayed in one to the tents. Everything was exceptional - from the food to the service to the ambiance. I really loved that it’s almost entirely constructed with biodegradable low carbon footprint materials esp bamboo. Even the rope binding the structures together was hand woven from natural materials. However a caveat. It’s not for everyone. You need to be reasonably nimble and mobile to navigate the stairs, rock steps, bamboo bridges etc. And tolerant of a few bugs. It’s a tropical forest for goodness sake - not some hotel in downtown Tokyo. So if you want hermetically sealed rooms with wheelchair access and no forest sounds this isn’t the place. If you want unique, natural forest vibe and don’t mind a bit of walking up and down then this place is amazing. Just the natural spring pools are worth it. Did an incredible meditation on a rock under a small waterfall overlooking forest and a series of spring pools. Food and drinks are also excellent.","We visited two separate days on the day-pass and enjoyed every moment! Close to Ubud, yet it feels like a world away. The delightful architecture, paths winding through the forest, creative nooks for sitting and enjoying the river and the spring-fed pools. The restaurant is delicious and the staff are kind and attentive. An absolute delight!",We stayed three nights at this amazing hidden jungle paradise. Two nights in one of the bamboo rooms and one night in one of the huts. It’s different from any other hotel you have experienced. So much attention to detail and such a wholesome experience from the carefully prepared food to the fresh water pools. We’ll be back,"A beautiful slice of peace, heaven and paradise. The moon house was incredible. I would love to come back and spend a month there. Everything about this place is so beautiful. Please bring back your old menu, it was delicious.",This is a unique hotel where nature couples with comfort and architectural beauty. Staff is incredibly supportive and kind. Food is also very good. Totally recommended if you want to have a truly memorable Balinese experience.

The only downside is that it is a bit far away from the popular tourist attractions in Ubud. A car or a scooter is highly recommended for getting around.","A very memorable and great stay at Hotel Gantari Ubud. The room is very beautiful and spacious for the price. Definitely value for money.
The service that was given by the hotel staff was great, they are very friendly and accommodating.
Although the hotel is located in a somewhat secluded area and is situated right next to a kindergarten, which can be a bit noisy in the morning, it didn’t detract from my overall great experience at Gantari.

Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable experience during their visit to Ubud.",Highly Recommended property to stay in Ubud! It’s located in a quiet alley yet everything is nearby.  The rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable. The service is amazing and special thanks to all staff.,A little far from the city center but a gem in the forest. Loved our stay here. Very well kept property. There is an elementary school behind the hotel so it could get noisy during weekdays.,I and my husband visited this resort about a year ago for our honeymoon. I love this property. We stayed 3 night there. Room is so cozy and comfortable with luxurious vibes by having super clean bathroom with bathtub. We booked pool side room. And also atmosphere of the resort is so nice. We can’t even get over those memories. Must stay property in ubud within budget. Loved it.

My hope for this review is that l can convey how overwhelming impressed we where with Kayumanis Villas and Spa in Ubud Bali.
The Villa accommodation is spacious and extremely private.
The amenities are 5 star.
The staff that make this resort run so efficiently are the most professional, courteous, attentive, and friendly Balinese people that we have had the pleasure to be amongst.
In the interest of making this a great review l will say that the hardest thing about being here will be the fact that we have to leave.
We look forward to our next stay.
I highly recommend the resort for anyone that wants to experience a high standard of accommodation and service. Thanks Kayumanis.","It was an absolutely amazing stay. The ambience in the villa and surrounding premises were stunning, and special. The private pool in the villa was very clean. The Spa was excellent. The customer service is one of the best I’ve experienced. They were very polite, and delivered the food to our villa on time to the dot every single day. They also set the table and served the food as if we’re sitting at a restaurant. Shuttle service to and from ubud market was convenient. The entire experience was very satisfying. We will certainly be back again.","Absolutely amazing! We had such a great time in our own villa with a nice pool that really looks stunning when you return in the evening. The service was one of the best I ever had. We loved the a la carte breakfast with plenty to choose from. Also the restaurant had delicious food as well and we ordered food every day to our villa. The table was set up nicely and you could eat in private.

A walk through the resort really feels like you are in a little jungle, with ancient walls to your side. The bridge you have to cross to get to the beautiful main pool really made us feel like we live far away from civilization.

Thank you Kayumanis Team for an unforgettable experience! We will miss your cookies. :-)","I cannot overstate how pleased my wife and I were with our choice to stay at Kayumanis Ubud. When you consider the surroundings, the facilities, the cost, and most importantly, the absolutely wonderful staff, I believe this was the best resort we have ever visited.

We are typically more likely to stay in busier tourist areas when we travel, and often stay at/near the beach. For our trip to Bali, we wanted something different, something more... well, Balinese. Ubud is off the beaten path compared to the other popular locations there, and that was one of the best things about it. It was a rather long drive to/from the airport and also the beach areas, but there is plenty to see and do in and around Ubud, so we didn't need to travel far most days.

Our private villa was beautiful, comfortable, clean, well-maintained, luxurious, and yes, quite private. The grounds all over the resort property were simply beautiful, immaculate, tastefully and thoughtfully designed and decorated.  We really enjoyed hearing all the sounds of nature around us. The private pool was such a nice feature, we used it every day.

The food at the resort far exceeded our expectations. Every meal we ate there was superb. The menu has a great variety and we tried lots of different types of food, and were never disappointed. In fact, we were delighted with how good everything was, whether we ate in the restaurant or had it delivered to our villa. We did tend to eat in the villa more often than not. The young ladies and gentlemen who brought our food and drinks were unfailingly quick, efficient, friendly and polite, and they all clearly took great pride in doing everything to the highest standard.

As wonderful as we found Ubud, and the villa, and the food at Kayumanis, what makes this resort so special are the people. Not only the dining staff, but every person we met there was obviously well trained and highly dedicated to providing outstanding service. I mean EVERY SINGLE PERSON.

I wish we could recall the names of all of our favorites, but these were a few who were especially wonderful: Meri at the front desk was so helpful and kind; Ade, also at the front desk, was great, particularly the day we were checking out; Soma was so cheerful and pleasant whenever he came to our villa to serve meals or drinks or to clean up afterwards, he always made us feel a little happier; Yani, at the spa, gave me probably the best massage I've ever had, and like everyone else at Kayumanis Ubud, she did so with such a positive and pleasant attitude.

I would not hesitate to recommend this resort to anyone. It was a fabulous, romantic, magical week. We hope to return someday.","Incredible stay in the “Suite” room.

Large, private garden with pool, spa, outdoor bathroom and lounge overlooking the jungle.

Staff were incredible: friendly, warm and genuine.

In-room meals, spa and swim - we barely left the room, that’s how wonderful it was.

Highly recommend!"

The location is somewhat secluded. It's by the edge of a rice field. Inside, there's a pool, plenty of cool trees. The place's design is good, aesthetic.

Taste [2/5]
I ordered grilled ribs and pasta. For the price, it's intermediate. In my opinion, there aren't too many food options. There are more drink options. It took about 40 minutes to wait for the 2 dishes because it might be crowded, and cooking ribs takes a long time. I didn't like the taste of the pasta, but the grilled ribs were tasty, although the rice was a bit lacking.

Service [3/5]
The service is a bit slow, especially during food serving. The service is friendly.

Facility [5/5]
There's a pool, a children's play area. Facilities for rinsing after swimming. The toilets are very clean. The swimming pool is clean.","Access is only via a narrow path for pedestrians and motorcycles, but they do offer a shuttle pick up service (in a golf cart) from a nearby car park.
The atmosphere here is great, super relaxing and everyone looks happy. We celebrated our daughter's 5th birthday here and the buffet food was great: local dishes (nasi goreng, satay chicken & fish, coconut milk curry etc) plus pizza & fries.
The pool is a fun shape which the kids loved, and there's even a pool bar (but it was unstaffed when we visited, so no service).
Lots of areas for kids to play, hide and explore.
And the price is very reasonable too!","Good Day Resto Pool and Bar in Ubud is a hidden gem that offers a memorable experience for all its guests. This exceptional venue boasts a large swimming pool complemented by a vibrant music ambiance, making it the perfect spot for relaxation and entertainment. Whether you're looking to indulge in a casual coffee and tea session or savor a full-course meal, their extensive menu caters to all tastes. While the prices are on the higher side, the value provided is unparalleled. One of the highlights is enjoying cocktails while lounging in the pool – a highly recommended activity. The staff at Resto Pool and Bar are commendable for their equal treatment of locals and foreigners, delivering consistent top-notch hospitality. This establishment comes highly recommended for anyone seeking a tranquil retreat in Ubud.","I am glad this restaurant is next to my villa
It has amazing atmosphere especially love that they served welcome drink and chip snack
Great n yummy food loved spring roll ,papaya salad omg one of the best dishes ,all cocktails were amazing like cosmopolitan was my favourite
Chicken parma was good
Only thing which could been better was fried chiken kangara or something it’s called . Calamari was little chewy but brownie with ice cream yum
I visited this restaurant twice can still go more","This place is a true hidden gem ❤️ I can't believe it hasn't been ""discovered"" yet, it's so beautiful and clean, has a pool, a restaurant, spa facilities with jacuzzi, chill pods, a playground for kids and 2 cowroking spaces with incredible views overlooking rice fields. Staff are so welcoming and nice! ❤️ Food is a bit mediocre but isn't horribly overpriced, cocktails are nice, and you only pay for what you eat/drink, everything else is FREE TO USE: no min. spend, no entrance fee, no fee for sunbeds!!! And you have free fast internet as well!!! And yet somehow it's never crowded at all! Super highly recommended, I'm a regular here now.

The place we stayed had some beautiful ceramics. Cups, plates etc for use. Looked at the bottom of it and saw this name. Looked it up and saw it was a Balinese company owned by an Italian couple. It was 800 meters from where we stayed. Bought two small vases. They also offered us a free 10 minute tour of the workplace. They are a supplier for all the big hotels all over the world. You could see how everything is made and the stock they have ready for their customers. Amazing! It is on the pricey side. For that price you get an amazing product!

Thank you!","Gaya Ceramics showcases exceptional craftsmanship; however, the designs may not cater to everyone's taste, including mine. The collection is diverse, but personal preferences play a significant role. While the quality justifies the price, exploring thoroughly before purchasing is recommended, as the designs might not align with every individual's aesthetic preferences.","A beautiful place with custom ceramics, tableware, decor items. The prices are rather expensive, so just took a look around for inspiration. Very aesthetic",Found on social media .. happy to finally visit the store and buy few pieces that I’ve been eyeing for a while .. collectible ceramics .. price is very reasonable for the quality that it is.,"Top notch ceramic store for pots and plates  lovers 😀

Additionally, coffee seems to be very mid, with Bali coffee being bland.

I really appreciate the effort that Mana has made in being intentional with all its facilities, resource management as well as designing the guest experience to be a pleasant one. Service of staff was immaculate, but tends to lean towards short-staffed with the housekeeping mistakes made during the stay. (But very commendable effort in rectifying mistakes, but things like missing pillowcase, non-adjustable showers - hot and cold water- where showers just blasted cold water with no option to adjust the water… suggests a lack of regular maintenance or standards.)","Not a good experience.
Went there with a impact study programme, staff (of both restaurant and programme leader) are not friendly. food was terrible, i understand that you're making effort to the zero waste but you could have make it more appealing...
They charge the programme very expensive but very short-staffed.

Also they tend to look down at people who they think is not as equal as them.
They're doing hotel business but know no hospitality.
Avoid this hotel at all cost.
Service at hotel is not as good as promoted. Takes forever to get even just one reply from the reception staff. And when i got there, oh boy them blamed everything on the internet and they told me that i'm not the only guest they have to serve... perfect.
it takes a group effort to let people down this much and they made it. congrats.","We had a great time at the Mana Earthy Paradise. The villa was very nice and huge! The garden, the location itself and the whole surrounding was very special (in a good way :)
The staff was helpful and extremly friendly.
The only downer: The ducks were VERY loud at night because we stayed there after the rice harvest, so that the ducks used the fields as a pool ;)
The restaurant was also extremly good!
Highly recommend this place! 10/10 ;)","We stayed at this accommodation for about 5 days. The villa is spacious and airy with a great living room area for everyone to chill and have meals. There’s a fridge and a kitchen sink but no stove. Rooms are spacious and come with a safe, clothing rack, fans etc. As it’s an eco hotel, the buildings are largely open air and there is no air con. That’s fine, as it’s what we anticipated and packed lightly to keep cool. Soap, shampoo and conditioner is provided. Mana’s staff are very friendly and helpful, they were accommodating during our trip. The owners are also very friendly if you run into them. Mana kitchen is also convenient if you are lazy to travel to Ubud Sentral.

Our only huge issue here was the severe mosquito/sandfly bites that some of us got during our stay. Although there are mosquito nets, they are not very effective. The natural mosquito repellent is also mostly essential oils, so it’s not very effective at keeping insects away. Take note if you are allergic to insects or if you are bringing small children! Insects will also randomly turn up in the room if you leave the doors open. These include grasshoppers, centipedes, leeches from the garden outside. Overall, a unique eco and sustainable experience with a nice ambience except for the insects.","The first time I came here was about a year ago. It was lovely, their small bites and pasta were delicious, and I kinda liked the vibe too. Last month came here again for the movie night. My kids enjoyed it. Unfortunately, it was so crowded that night, kids felt left out a bit, especially for their meals. Luckily one staff was so helpful. She had everything sorted. Maybe we'll go there again next time when the place is more settled for us😄"

I’m an Indian and I stayed here 3 nights.
1. If you find geckos and lizards scary; the place is not for you. We had 10 plus in our villa and a geckos arm-size lingering over the kitchen area. But that’s all part of nature. And yes, some small frogs that jump higher than I could imagine took me off guard.

2. Lights can be dim in the evening. So villa looks all sad in darkness. But in the morning, it is so so good; so many pictures can be taken in this property.

3. There’s microwave and Gas stove with cutlery in this place so you can prepare basic food as you can. Con - there is no breakfast available at the property.

4. Location - Decent; but street is pretty dark that makes it inaccessible in the evening post 7pm apart from a Car.

5. Bathroom - it’s pretty good but hot water has issues as there’s a senseless limit of 15 litres hot water and then 30 minutes wait to get another 15 L again.

6. Entertainment - TV has 12 local channels and does not sync with your phone or streaming apps. So that was sad.

Lastly, Wari from Kamajaya staff went out of the way and helped us with any issue we raised. So salute to him for that!","this place so lovely, we like staying here the place not to far from the center, also the staff very helpful. the vibe in the villa such different and quite, i recommend to stay here for short/long term XO",Good place. Good experience. The room was clean and nice albeit a little run down. The pool was clean and so was the living space. Had a minor lizard issue which was quickly resolved. Front desk was helpful with finding us a laundry and getting it there and back to us.,"While it can be difficult to find off busy main road, the location is very quiet.  Our villa  accommodations and pool were clean, neat and tidy. Small bar fridge with small minibar. As with most things in Bali, the maintenance not so good but it didn't impede our stay. Staff very friendly.  Breakfast good though on Bali time. They have a good menu, which is ordered in, though it was cold when it arrived. We hired scooters which was great.","Located away from the hustle bustle of the Ubud traditional market, Kamajaya offers a relaxing and peaceful getaway option to tourists. It has a total of 11 villas with a open shower, private pool, kitchen, dining and living area, bedroom, a big bathroom with a bath tub. The villas are spacious and clean. Since it is a relatively small property, breakfast is served inside the villa. One has to fill up the breakfast form and give it a day before. They can arrange for a bike/scooter for the guests. Staff is sweet and courteous. Worth the price! Would love to go back for a second visit. Would recommend to carry your own toiletries as the soap and shampoo smells a bit different."

They are also a very eco-conscious establishment, connected to a larger NGO.

We need to be mindful of the oils and salts that restaurants use, and Mana uses coconut oil and sea salt, which is very refreshing compared to most other restaurants on the island claiming they are “healthy” or “clean”.

The menu was impressive, you can tell the chef is well-trained and seasoned. We ordered the Lamb Gulai curry and it was the most delicious curry in my recent memory. We also ordered the Karaage Gochujang along with cassava fries.

Everything tasted fresh, it was definitely alive food that was complimented with a chef’s kiss.

Would totally recommend this spot to anyone seeking food that is both clean as well as flavorful.","My favorite restaurant in Ubud!! The atmosphere is very authentic and cozy, and the staff are lovely! The food is very good and very reasonably priced. I have been having breakfast or lunch there almost every day on my first 10-day stay in Ubud, and I just HAD TO come back for one dinner four months later on my very short 3-day Ubud trip last month! Never disappointed with Mana Kitchen - from the awesome drinks to the amazing Octopus Curry!!","For someone who lives nearby I can't remember Mana as a choice due to my experience during pandemic where food feels bland and off. However recently when I returned they seem to havr better food option and improvements on the flavor. I need to explore more on the food. Price is reasonable
Service can be better their staffs busier talking with loud laugh rather than being attentive.

Ambience is calm and nice.","We were seated at a pretty uncomfortable table that was in the garden. I had to use double cushions to be able to get my body in the right position to eat. The cushions were also stained. Thats just not right. It made me feel a bit dirty. There also was a hole in the table. The umbrellas were disgusting. They were soiled and they had holes in them. Totally unacceptable for outdoor dining. It looks like they just didn’t wanna make any investment anymore in their establishment. I had the lunch special for a 98 rupiah it was just OK and I wouldn’t recommend it, the gazpacho was not fresh. The mushrooms were delicious. The salad was so small that I don’t understand why they even bother giving it to me. The chicken curry were parts of the chickens bodied drained in a curry sauce. It was really hard to eat it quite messy however, the curry sauce tasted very nice, I didn’t really care for the rice didn’t have much flavor and it was in the middle of the plate which was difficult to get around to eat. The waitress never came back after she serve me my lunch I had to go find her my friend ordered the banana pancakes, it was flavorless. It was mostly oatmeal with no flavor of the banana. I had the coconut cheesecake, which was delicious. Probably the best thin. there was a car park and an attendant to help you. It was very hot I sweated through the whole lunch. I have to say the bathrooms were probably the best ones in Bali because they were quite large and easy to access. I’m not going to return because I didn’t feel I really got any value for my money just because the place is hipster doesn’t guarantee that it’s going to be nice.","This is a lovely spot for wonderful coffee, fresh tasty food that is beautifully presented, and friendly, attentive service.

Its such a beautiful place to stay and the staff made you feel so special, especially Eka the concierge and Gusti and Dickie and Adi the butlers. We were so sad to leave.

I wish to also thanks to the hotel team and their butler especially Mr Dicky. He is very sweet, attentive, and energetic.
I will definitely come back here again when ever I plan the trip to Bali and it’s highly recommend to everyone who need cozy private place to stay.
Also the view is spectacular too 🤩","If you ever plan a trip to bali, and especially Ubud area- look no further. This is the BEST place to be. Way better than nusa dua (oh so well promoted on the internet yet 5 star resorts are disgusting in reality). I suggest staying in the villa with a heated pool, it's better than the maldives.  Very private, clean, and quiet. Service,  restaurant, and spa were also excellent.
The hotel also offers tours with a private driver, which is great.","I wish I could give more stars because Uma Kalai absolutely deserves it! I stayed for two nights with my boyfriend and we wish we could have stayed longer.

We opted for their airport transport and our driver, Rana, provided us with cold towels, drinks, and snacks. Upon arrival, the entire staff greeted us and showed us around. All of the facilities were amazing—the gym has a reformer and the view at the pool was breathtaking. The spa area was beautiful and we got amazing Balinese massages from Yuni and Sambo. We stayed in the Bhumi room so we had a private heated pool and a steam room. The interior of the room and facilities were so detailed, it is obvious that a lot of thought went into it.

However, what sets this place apart is the impeccable service. Our room was cleaned twice a day. We were added into a group chat with the entire staff, who made themselves available at all times. They were so friendly and passionate about what they do, especially Gusti. Thank you to Gusti, Dicky, Eka, Rana, Yuni, Sambo and the entire staff for making our stay so special.

Thank you Torris for an excellent cooking class. The day was superb and we will recommend it to all our Australian friends.","What a great experience. Calm location atop a running river and jungle, makes for a location worth checking out. The food options are traditional Balinese, Thai and Western. Something for everyone. Super fresh ingredients make for a tasty meal worth returning for. Villas and spa in such a quiet location. This place has it all for those who want peace and calm without the crowds you have to navigate in other hot spots in Bali. I'll definitely be back!"

I even spent more than hours sittung on their cozy long chair and had my relaxing time. Better to go inside rather than outside because most of the time the traffic view will caused stress if your visit aims to calm your mind and get peace. The food was great. The pandan pancake is the best pancake ive ever try. The cream was smooth, not super sweet, and the ginger ice latte was superb! The place isnt recom for you if your visit is in hurry. They need to prepare is very calm way. Mine came around an hour after",Good food and ambience. They've an outdoor setting as well. But beware of mosquito bites. I loved their Balinese quesadilla and drinks.,"Had the best food here during my time in bali.
The food was very comforting and tasty, a perfect start to the day.
They also have an all day breakfast here

Before you complain on frogs, insects in pool remind yourself where you are and how much you paid for accommodation.

There is everything what you need : safe box, hair dryer, plates, glasses, towels, beach towels.
Location wasn't a problem for us - you can easily take grab bike to Ubud center for 1,5 USD. We walked one time and it took only 40min but I don't reccomend because of traffic.

Property offers massage, food and drinks in really good price :)","Booked on Airbnb for an affordable price. One of the best stays ever. Situated in the midst of rice fields, has a kitchen area and also a private pool! Ample space, serene and peaceful and away from noise. The caretaker was helpful and helped us in getting food ordered and also got us a two wheeler. The pool was very clean and we regret not staying there for longer. Bathtub was also there inside.","This villa looks perfectly on the photos but reality is different.
Villa is located in really bad place. It’s hard to get there by a scooter.
Kitchen is dirty, pool is dirty, bathroom is dirty. Villa is no clean enough. Staff don’t do a cleaning properly 😔.
Geckos screem all night in the villa.
One positive think is really comfortable bed.
I wouldn’t recommend this stay. Find something better. It didn’t worth it.","Really nice accommodation.

It's a bit remote from Ubud and transport to and from the villa can be a bit awkward. We rented a scooter so it was fine for us.

Instructions for arrival were not very clear, we had to be dropped at Moksa restaurant and then some staff from the villa picked us up on a motorbike.

Staff were very friendly.

Bathrooms were not very clean.

Overall good value for money",beautiful affordable villa with a small kitchen and a proper plunge pool.the staff were very helpful.the rooms were big and the bed was comfy.can not order food here.we opted for gojek which delivered our food right at our door.

We went there for breakfast several times, and once we went to a Balinese traditional dinner with a dance show - VERY memorable and worth it!!","The best restaurant in Bali by far!!!!!!! The restaurant is located in a middle of rice fields, simply gorgeous and peaceful. Food is SUPERB!!! If clean/healthy eating is your thing, look no further! The chefs can certainly cook anything and everything ( e.g Balinese, western or asian cuisines). Usually not the case but these chefs proved me wrong!! The service is outstanding, always showing attentiveness and great manners. We had such great dining experiences, thank you 💚💚","I recently had the pleasure of dining at Takir Restaurant & Bar, nestled amidst the serene rice fields, and it was an experience to remember. The tranquil atmosphere sets the stage for a memorable dining journey.

For my main course, I savored the NASI BIRA, a flavorful Balinese Spices Fried Rice served with a beautifully presented Traditional Puffed Egg and succulent Chicken Satay. The combination of aromatic spices and the perfect balance of flavors made this dish a true delight. The portion size was generous, leaving me completely satisfied.

To satisfy my sweet tooth, I indulged in the PISANG GORENG dessert. The Battered ripe banana, fried to perfection, arrived piping hot and was delicately sprinkled with icing sugar. The decadent treat was elevated further with a side of rich Ice Cream and drizzled with Honey Sauce. It was a sweet symphony of flavors and textures.

What truly stood out at Takir Restaurant & Bar was the exceptional hospitality of the staff. They were incredibly sweet and attentive, ensuring that every aspect of my dining experience was delightful.

In conclusion, Takir Restaurant & Bar offers more than just a meal; it provides a peaceful escape amidst nature, where you can savor outstanding Balinese cuisine. With delectable dishes, generous portions, and warm service, it's a dining destination that I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a memorable culinary adventure.","Fantastic healthy menu. Reasonable price. Love the ambience. Good customer service. They are still new and there are some area is under development (rooftop deck - I think). I still amazed and wonder how can they build with such a small road. To eat here, you'll need to park your car at the parking area. Contact the hotel's tuk tuk / bajaj to go inside. It's already an unique experience and if you want to get more unique experience, then it's better you come and have a staycation here. Note - Out of topic: come and try their health stone chamber. 😜","The staff is amazing. The food is great. I will definitely come back to stay in the Vila /hotel and or eat at its restaurant.
The variety for dinner /lunch is nice and the prices are OK.
The only thing that I would change is the variety for breakfast, as it seemed also main dishes, so no more than pancakes or one kind of bowl with yogur and oat to Choose apart from savory things.
I definitely recommend this place."

The downside is it's just quite far from the parking lot. You have to take around 10-15minutes walk. But if you rent a bike, then it's not a problem at all. Would definitely come back again for our anniversary.","The service is magnificent, we had a small complain and they handled it very well. The workers are very helpful. The place is pretty new, quite and peaceful among rice fields. If you stay here and hire a motorbike (and good in riding it) will be a benefit for you since there's a short cut directly to ubud.","Awesome villa situated in the middle bof vast green rice fields , also not far from Ubud square, 10 mins in a bike or half an hour by walk . very clean comfortable spacious villa.

Minimum spend for the day is 500,000 - doesn't take long to get there with all the delicious options on the menu. I had the jackfruit rendang, cassava fries, smoothie bowl, ginger beer and coconut ice cream over the course of the 12 hours I spent relaxing, swimming and napping.

Absolutely visit this place if you're in the area.","Very stunning view
The design of the hotel is very unique and very blend to its surroundings
Food choices are limited but taste good","This restaurant  is one of the most unique restaurants I have ever visited in my lifetime.
It's part of an eco resort in a very romantic setting by the river in Sayan.

The staff and the service were very good.

The food and drinks were fresh,  well prepared, authentic Indonesian, and very tasty.

I highly recommend this restaurant to people seeking a unique experience and authentic Indonesian food.","Not impressed with the food. Strange policy having to sign a liability waiver before given access.

We came here for sunset drinks and dinner and left rather underwhelmed by everything  except for the beautiful surroundings.

Let’s start with arriving: before being ‘allowed’ into the resort, one must sign a liability waiver!
I’ve never encountered that anywhere in the world other than in the US of A . This is Bali, it’s far more dangerous to drive a scooter to the resort than walking around the grounds, even if there are some steps and bridges.

Sunset drinks: we ordered drinks at the sunset bar, by the time the drinks arrived the sunset was pretty much done, as it took 45mins for the cocktail to be served. That’s unacceptable, even if there was a group of 10 people ordering cocktails at once.  The cocktail tasted good though, but was expensive for Bali at 150k++ per drink.
The view from the bar is spectacular, and probably the reason why they get away with this service and prices.

Dinner: We took the bamboo elevator down to the walkway that leads across bamboo bridges and a winding staircase to the restaurant. The setting is nice, but since it was already dark, we couldn’t really see much of the natural pools and surrounding areas.
The restaurant itself is rather a simple setting with small tables and wooden stools instead of chairs, that turned out to be very uncomfortable after sitting for a while. I left with a backache (maybe that’s why I had to sign the liability waiver?).
The food menu is limited, about 5-6 Balinese style dishes, written on a chalkboard, brought to the table once seated.  We ordered grilled fish served with rice, and grilled probiotic chicken served with rice. The presentation of the food was good, the portions small, and the taste was at average Warung level.
The price however was quite steep; after taxes and service charge it was 3-4 times higher than comparable dishes at other Warungs in Penestanan.  OK, this place is in a special location. But given that at night time not much of the landscape is visible and the uncomfortable seating, I found it to be too expensive for what it offered.

I don’t think I will return to the bar or the restaurant."

Comes with mashed potato and sautéed vegetables. They said mashed potato can be changed with French fries. I love it!! Staff is lovely, local from the neighborhood.

Have to say it’s the best nasi goreng I’ve had in Bali. The chicken that comes on the side is so delicious.

Tried the smashed avocado on toast, it's delicious.","For me this has become a regular stop when visiting Ubud. This cute and charming cafe is conveniently located along the main road of Sayan, but tucked away from the road. My eyes are always drawn the the beautiful mural world map. Much more than just a coffee shop they serve super tasty dishes at affordable prices. The brownies!!!
Central Ubud is full of your typical instagrammable coffee shops but this one in Sayan just outside town is definitely worth visiting if you're looking for something new. You'll be returning often!"
