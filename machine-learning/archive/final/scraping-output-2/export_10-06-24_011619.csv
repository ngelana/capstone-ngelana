It’s really overpriced but so poorly maintained. The villas are old, everything is falling apart.
The view is nice tho, and it’s cute that there is a pool, but those are the only good things about it.
Also, there are huge cockroaches living inside the kitchen cabinet and just around the whole place. And we saw a centipede about 5 times just casually slithering around. You know what those things do to you, right?
So it’s a biiig no, I don’t recommend","Paid a visit to deliver something only. If you are a novice driver/rider, better park your vehicle at the bottom of the hill, near the security post.

The villas are on steep hill, parking here is not for the faint hearted.

But the view.... 🤩with breathtaking 180° view of the west and east of the island. Awesome!","Had a great stay at this place. It is located very privately, but the houses are decorated nicely and the villa was very clean. I also liked the swimming pool in the backyard, something I did not expect. The wifi was a bit slow in the villa, which could be annoying because I sometimes had to work online during my stay, but overall it was a nice stay.","This place is located in Jimbaran Area, which is quite comfortable and quiet so the atmosphere is suitable for those who like this atmosphere. There is a private swimming pool in each villa so privacy can be maintained. The officers were kind and friendly, although there were some drawbacks but overall it was very pleasant staying here.","Bad wifi, the room is standard, nothing surround this place is interesting. The cool thing about this place is only the private pool and view, but the pool also not clean. Water heater work well on villa 5-O. Tv channel is the worst, you can watch nothing.

Wifi jelek, kolam agak kotor, kamar standard aja, agak kotor tp masi ok lah, view lumayan, keluar hotel ga ada apa2 krn terletak di dlm perumahan. Water heater oke. Tv cmn ada 3 channel dan gambarnya jelek semua."

Arriving very late from the UK, the driver was waiting at arrivals and was so welcoming.  A short drive to the villa, we were met with what was in all intents and purposes a private hotel experience with truly wonderful staff.  The villa is tastefully finished with extravagant en-suite bathrooms and dressing rooms. With the concierge(Butler), chef, housekeepers, security and gardeners looking after your every need there was little left to want for.  Except for perhaps a massage, which was only a call away and swiftly arranged by the butler.  The villa is set in a peacefully secluded area but only a stones throw by car from all the main beaches and (if you are a foodie) many cool restaurants - but at a third of the prices of London equivalents.  The driver (Chauffeur) was on hand to spoil us by dropping and picking up from our every location as well as being a personal tour guide.  Days started with a swim in the perfect pool in the perfect setting and they only got better.","This villa is truly magical! This was my first time in Bali and we stayed for 7 nights. The facilities and grounds are exceptional from the enormous pool, games room to the massage marquee there is everything you need and WAY MORE in this villa. Upon arrival we were greeted by the villa manager, the chef and the rest of the staff. Throughout the week the staff continued to be incredibly friendly and give amazing local advice on what to do and where to go. The food made by the chef was so yummy that we honestly hardly felt the need to go anywhere else! I really recommend this villa.","Had the most incredible time here! I stayed at this Villa with a group of friends and we had a delightful time. When we planned this trip I was really excited having looked at all the photographs of the Villa, it looked amazing. When we arrived I realized that the house and gardens are even more beautiful than the pictures let on. The experience exceeded my expectations and the staff were wonderful, their kindness and attention to detail made the trip unforgettable. If you ever feel like leaving the luxury of the Villa, beach, shopping and amazing restaurants are close by. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to spend relaxing time with a close group of friends or family. You'll make amazing memories.","The photos of Villa Umanina are impressive, however the real thing is even more breathtaking! We arrived in the evening after a long flight and the driver was waiting for us to transport our family to the villa. On arrival, we marveled at the beauty of the villa all lit up and welcoming with the warm lights. An even warmer welcome awaited us from the staff, professional and smiling with a refreshing drink at the ready.. Each spacious bedroom is more impressive than the next with tasteful, classy decor and furnishings. Every one with dressing room and large en suite bathroom. Excellent Chef ready to make food from an extensive menu (each meal better than the next). Balinese Massage lady just a phone call away to soothe away any stresses and memories of normal hectic l life (so affordable we had a massage every day!) Our 4 teenagers enjoyed the media room watching a vast choice of Satellite TV channels and using the pool table, table tennis etc. Driver always on hand to take us to nearby super cool beaches and beach clubs as well as discovering the beauty of Bali and seeing all the spectacular sights. I highly recommend this Villa. It surpassed our expectations.","I don’t usually write reviews but Villa Uma Nina was so special that not only did it deserve one, but it would have been negligent not do so.

This was our first family trip to Bali and we spent 10 glorious days in August at Villa Uma Nina.  It’s truly impressive: from the main house which is beautifully and tastefully decorated, to the four large spacious bedrooms (and there are two more in the guesthouse!), on to the large gardens and the beautiful pool, and the outdoor dining bale where the meals are served.  Everything oozed class.  It has a stunning view of the city of Denpasar and the Indian Ocean.  The volcano atop Mount Raung can even be seen on a clear day…

Upon arrival we were greeted by villa chef Kumang and his staff (who were ready with welcome drinks).  I must admit that the food prepared at the villa was a huge and welcome surprise!  Chef Kumang is ready to prepare bespoke meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Don’t worry too much as there is a vast menu of options to help you decide.  Big hint: do NOT miss out on the Beef Rendang!  On the days when you might want to venture out, there is a book at hand with suggestions for excellent restaurants and bars.  Trust me though: you’re going to want to eat in most days…

We could have spent every day lounging at the pool, playing Bocce Ball (yes there was a bocce ball court where a fierce family competition would occur daily), or even just being lazy in the games room (which also has a pool table).  On the days when we did venture outside, Kadek (the villa driver) knew exactly where to take us: beautiful beaches, the city for shopping, sightseeing trips to various temples, and we always always felt safe.  There is a massage shrine in the back of the gardens, and a masseuse can be summoned in no time.  It is so inexpensive that it was an almost daily ritual for the entire family!

It has been such a memorable vacation at Villa Uma Nina.  It helped us relax and explore the wonderful island of Bali. We will be back for sure!!!"

Being seasoned travelers ourselves, and having stayed there for over our wedding holiday, it had definitely exceeded our expectations in every aspect!

We highly recommend to anyone - couples and families alike, who are seeking for a low-key getaway amongst lush greenery, while being close proximity to the city center. (only 10 minutes ride!)
The views were breathtaking. The air was crisp. The surroundings were amazing.

We managed to book in a 3-bedroom Villa for ourselves and we were wonderfully awe-struck by how well-designed the rooms are!
They were huge and generous, yet still felt incredibly homely and warm. The infinity swimming pool was crystal clear and we had a wonderful and relaxing time lazing along the edges all day.

Our experience with the staff at Dayu Mirah was outstanding!
Until this day, we remember the radiant smiles on their faces while making sure we were absolutely comfortable from the moment we checked in.

In summary, We felt incredibly spoilt and we are beyond grateful for the selfless, stress-free, warm and welcoming experience throughout our stay!
Would've given 6 stars if that was an option :D
Go experience it for yourselves!

Looking forward to our stay there again soon!!!","Dayu Mirah Resort is a hidden gem that offers an unforgettable escape from bustling city life. Its top-notch villas, impeccable service, and tranquil surroundings make it a remarkable destination for those seeking a serene and luxurious retreat.

Each villa features three spacious rooms, providing ample accommodation for guests. The vast swimming pool, overlooking lush greenery, offers a refreshing escape. The resort also boasts a big parking lot, ensuring guests' convenience and its own beautifully landscaped gardens. Two rooms come with private jacuzzis!

The service at Dayu Mirah Resort is also exceptional! The staff members are attentive and friendly. From the moment I arrive until my departure, they cater to my every need, making me feel pampered and well taken care of throughout my stay. Dayu Mirah Resort is a highly recommended destination for those seeking a peaceful and rejuvenating getaway. I'll definitely be back! Thank you!",The place is wonderful and we had super lux experience of service and attention,"Good Service , Staff very capable and helpful , Reservation is done professionally.",An amazing and comfortable villa and is very serene.

Like no other Villa I’ve seen which was a step above the rest, very unique and more a multimillion-dollar luxury home away from home.

We stayed through the Christmas and New Year peak period with our family, which turned out to be the perfect Bali retreat for spending quality family time together. The property is massive, with everything you need at the villa, from in house chefs, housekeeping, huge living and entertainment areas, 5 bedrooms and ensuite’s immaculately appointed. This beautiful Residence includes a stunning cliff edge infinity pool with sweeping 180-degree views over the Island of the Gods. The fireworks display over Bali on NYE was incredible.

Now into the fun stuff:

There is a world class gym including facilities like a sauna and steam room, a bar with an adjoining nightclub / dance floor with an integrated stereo system / DJ setup, unlike anything we’ve seen. The kids and big kids also have access to a fully fitted games room including xbox’s, tv’s, bean bags and not to forget there is also a Cinema (yes a real cinema) that can fit up to 20 people with reclining chairs and a full wall sized screen. To top it all off there is also a pool table, karaoke, large kitchen and upstairs entertaining area where everyone can sit down together to enjoy a meal.

This villa is highly recommended and perfect for exclusive and secluded get aways with plenty of privacy offered. The staff were amazing and the villa is only a hop skip and a jump away from the amazing Melasti Beach and numerous other world class venues.
