It‚Äôs a quiet lunch but all the food we ordered has fresh ingredients with generous portions.

They don‚Äôt skimp. I ordered Foie Gras and it was a larger portion than a typical portion in most places while having a reasonable price.

The place is quiet, the beach is beautiful, the food is excellent. Do come here if you like a more private beach club experience","It‚Äôs a pleasant place to enjoy the day! Highly recommended to spend some time alone, coupled or even with family. The foods and beverages are excellent. Moreover, the ambience is homey, and the help of the staffs are abundant.",Gorgeous beachside experience. Two great pools and lovely white sand.

If you are looking for a relaxing and luxurious stay, there is no better place. From the yoga on the beach with July to the head massages with cucumber by the pool, this hotel knows how to make you feel special.

We stayed in the honeymoon suite and it didn't disappoint. The room was a great size and was decorated nicely. The beach was quiet and peaceful. Their gardens are beautiful and very zen like, and the pool area was just stunning!!

The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating and the use of their butler service was very helpful.

Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer! If you book Samabe you won't regret it.","We had the most amazing and relaxing holiday at Samabe. The service was incredible and staff were so attentive. The venue was magnificent - we felt like we were in another world. The food was delicious with a fantastic variety. We really enjoyed the guest activities and services as well - cooking classes, fruit carving, jamu making, gym, massages. Highly recommended and hope to be back soon!","We‚Äôve stayed here twice now and it‚Äôs a fantastic resort! The pool villas are like a personal oasis, the resort is tropical and spacious and the staff are  phenomenal. Also, there are numerous activities on offer to make your stay more interesting and extra special. The restaurants offer a wide variety of food to accommodate all tastes and the overall experience is second to none. I highly recommend this resort.","If I could give this hotel more stars, I would! This place exceeded our expectations. The service was incredible and the use of the E Butler service on WhatsApp was brilliant. Whatever we needed, we would use the app to contact reception and in less than a minute one of the staff would respond every time. They were so respectful towards myself and my husband, with warm greetings everytime the staff passed us. The hotel room was serviced twice a day and each time our room was left spotless. The free usage of kayaks and paddle boards were a hit and we loved the little freebies provided by the hotel. We were left in awe of the place and will definitely be back. We would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Nusa Dua. They won‚Äôt disappoint!","We came here for our honeymoon, and it was a trip of a lifetime. The staff were absolutely amazing and so friendly, the ebutler was so nice, and the entire place is just breathtaking. I will tell anyone I know they need to put this place on their bucket list. It was totally worth the 26 hours of flying to get here and every penny. Our favorite staff were Putra, Susi, Ayu, Roby and Febri!

We stayed in a honeymoon suite and watched the sunrise over the beach every morning!"

The private pool was a highlight and where we spent a lot of time watching the para gliders overhead.
Everything was so clean and well looked after and the staff went above and beyond with any request.  A very friendly place to stay with a fantastic buffet breakfast supplied each morning, overlooking the beautiful Indian Ocean.
Ulu Segara also offer many activities like Balinese dress up and offerings - highly recommend this.  We were looked after for most of the afternoon by the very sweet Ari who taught us so much about the local culture.
The large pool at the front of the property is also fantastic, with a swim up bar - thanks to Riko for being the kindest and sweetest person to ever make us some cocktails!  The Beach Bar is kind of hidden away slightly but is also a perfect location for cocktails and some chilled tunes.
It was a short drive away (5-10 mins maximum) from the main Nusa Dua area, however shuttle buses were offered for people wanting to head into the Bali Collection.  The peace and quiet of the whole area was so relaxing. Wished we had been able to stay here for longer, we will be back.","I would say that the service is 6üåü and even beyond. Fantastic service all round.
What I didn‚Äôt quite like was the location as it was quite difficult to get around. Even accessing the front lobby from the room required a buggy unless you walk out and up. For those with senior citizens, you may want to avoid this villa. The front steps to the lobby itself are very non-friendly to seniors. The pool looked nice and I had the nicest times lounging next to the pool. The breakfast selection is quite limited so if you manage your expectations, it‚Äôs all good. The rooms are huge and the view was magnificent. The thing that was mind boggling to me was that there seems to be a sheen of water over every surface, which I am not sure why. Is it because it‚Äôs by the sea? The water from the tap is salty so it‚Äôs saltwater, which is fine, just don‚Äôt use that to boil otherwise you will have salted coffee and tea.
But as I said, fantastic service from every personnel. They were really really attentive.
Oh it‚Äôs located next to the parasailing ü™Ç Centre, if you have time, should definitely check it out.","Probably the only unblocked sea facing hotel with reasonable room rates along this part of the coast. Room is very big at 100m¬≤. Full height window and a long balcony with full sea view. You wouldn't want to miss the Sunrise moment here. Walk down to the beach, it's not crowded, the area here is sheltered from the big waves further out, so it's calm and clear during low tide.  You'll find some Fish and crabs here. We enjoyed our welcome drinks at the little beach club. Breakfast is more to Asian buffet style. Free buggy rides within the resort, and free shuttle van to Bali Connection too. Amazing!","Hard to rate this resort.  On one had the suite rooms with the balcony are very nice.  Beautiful view and the suite itself is great.  Unfortunately nothing else is exceptional. It advertises itself as a 5* resort‚Ä¶. but not even close.  Breakfast is average, not great but not bad.  Limited selection and boring.  Room service is fast, but on the more expensive side and the portion sizes tiny. Annoying. The water provided in the rooms is extremely limited and they only offer these small little ghetto bottles (not even properly sealed) throughout the entire resort.  Bali is a hot tropical island, they really need to offer more for guests.

Housekeeping did a good job, but there are 100 stains on literally every single piece of furniture.  Even the drapes have tons of stains on them.  5 star resort ‚Ä¶ ?‚Ä¶.  This feels like someone wanted to build an upscale hotel, but then quit half way through. And gave up.  The beach bar is boring and limited. The bartender there is a random dude who doesn‚Äôt know a single thing. Disappointing. Everything about this hotel is disappointing, except for the room and the view, both of which are very nice.

Pool area needs attention. So many bugs, all over the place.  Why doesn‚Äôt anyone clean up?

Service average. Standard.

Beach outside‚Ä¶. Forgotten.  The stairs walking down have been abandoned and construction unfinished - looks like for a decade.  Garbage everywhere, and the same garbage, so they don‚Äôt even clean it up each day. Strange. Local fishermen hangout on the abandoned steps into the ocean, and they just leave their garbage there.  No one
Picks it up. And the fishermen fish in the ocean right in front of the resort, making swimming there kind of awkward.  I don‚Äôt want to get a hook in my face when I‚Äôm swimming. Actually I kind of liked watching them fish (no big fish, they only catch tiny little ones) - in the island of Bali where everything is catering for tourists, they were the only real authentic thing I saw.

I liked watching the fishermen, and the nice suite, but all the little details are a fail at this resort.  Disappointing.

I wouldn‚Äôt come back here.","We stayed for 2 nights and were amazed with everything we had there (except the breakfast). I love the location which is quiet. Love the view from our suite room which is unbelievably gorgeous! Room is so spacious and clean. The service is good. They have private beach as well. The swimming pool is amazing! Love to stay again there without the breakfast. Yeah. The breakfast menu is so basic. Not many options. Please revise the menu and improve its quality. I found some sushi & fried spring roll steamed.. so weird. But other than breakfast, everything is EXCELLENT! Bravo!!!"
