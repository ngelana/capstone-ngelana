There are several meeting room options

They served us well and friendly
The room facilities and all equipment functions well, but there is one important note, so that the musty smell of the pillows can be eliminated
The rest I am satisfied with the hotel service","The breakfast at Quest San Hotel in Bali is often praised for its variety, freshness, and quality. Guests appreciate the diverse selection of both local and international dishes, including fresh fruits, pastries, traditional Indonesian fare, and made-to-order options. The dining area is usually well-maintained, and the staff are known for their attentive service. Overall, Quest San Hotel tends to offer a satisfying breakfast experience for guests staying in Bali.","I stayed here for 9 nights and it was very nice. I requested a room in second floor and they granted it. Also the breakfast was great. They clean the room from 8 am to 7 pm so unless you hang the dnd sign, they will knock your room to ask if you want to clean it or not in between those hours. The ac in my room was leaking but it wasn‚Äôt that bad.
Overall it was a please experience to stay here.

The location is in middle of the city but it‚Äôs quite hard to find convenience store nearby."

Pros:
- nice and cozy building
- clean and decent swimming pool
- very kind staff and manager
- big Smart TV
- big working table
- cotton buds provided

Cons:
- quite small room for 2 person, but more than enough for one occupant
- annoying (if i cant say trashy) internet connection. Couldnt watch Youtube without buffering, even Instagram reels needed a time to load
- limited cellular connection. Cant use your cell to replace that bad wi-fi connection
- limited amenities. No toothbrush, no slippers, no table tissue. But they gave cotton buds",Everything is great. I say really great!!

Stayed for 1 week. clean room.  quite good.  but unfortunately the room is not airtight.  get the front room.  the sound of motorbikes, guests opening the door, starting the car, can all be heard clearly and disturb your rest.  even the sound from the badminton court opposite was very clear.  very uncomfortable.  I woke up several times because there was a speeding motorbike with a loud exhaust sound.  Maybe if you get a room at the back, there won't be any problems because it's far from the street.

Spacious parking area.
The surrounding area also safe and have 3 securities who standby everyday 24/7
All the staffs are very helpful, fast response and informative. Especially the Admin lady and the manager they are very nice.
Been living here for almost 3 months loving the places so much.
Easy access to Denpasar, Imam Bonjol -  Kuta and Kerobokan
During sunset you could go up to the 2/3rd floor to see the stunning sunset views.
They provided free flow water and semi open rooftop and clean kitchen area. üòçüòç","The staff is incredibly nice, they go above and beyond to quickly resolve any issues that you might have during your stay, and most importantly they are very nice, caring, and friendly!

The staff also keeps the building clean 100% of the time making sure that the floor is cleaned once or twice EVERY single day and that the trash is taken out all the time.

The bed in the room is of super high quality and everything is almost brand new and in tip-top shape!","I stayed here for a short while when I was moving places, so definitely not a long term review.

I felt like this is a much more ""industrialized"" place rather than a homely feel. It's definitely not a bad thing if it's the accommodation you are looking for, but calling ""Coliving"" is stretching that word a bit too far.

That said, there is plenty of parking, the staff is very attentive, and despite the rooms being small, the kitchen is well equipped, and although I didn't cook anything, it certainly looked like a nice shared kitchen.

Unlike what previous reviews say, there is an ongoing construction in front of this place. It's not annoying, and the doors do a great job isolating the noise, but it can be a bit too overwhelming combined with the constant honking of the vehicles and speeding bikes at night.","Modern, clean, very well maintained, nice location, safe, fast respond & helpful staffs.

Wonderful staff, daily cleaning if you want this, super friendly staff. The pool was nice and quiet - a little oasis. This place is a bit impractical for people who want to be walking distance of attractions, I would say it‚Äôs best to have a scooter since you live in central Denpasar and are close to everything by bike !

There is a gym in the house which is available to those who booked accommodation- the gym is small but perfect with weight training options as well as treadmills and a space for stretching.

Would highly recommend this place to anyone who is on a small budget, who likes it very local, who want to work out and has a bike! And for anyone who wants to run away from Canggu etc. - where there is the terrible social media influencer infestation üò©

Would definitely stay here again when back in Bali!","I booked for two days in this hotel, There were positive and negative experiences that we had.

Positive
1. Value for money hotel
2. It has a swimming pool even though it's small
3. It has a big room
4. AC is working properly and it's cold.

Negative
1. If you stay for one night, you must request to make up your room, otherwise it won't be cleaned up and no extra mineral water.
2. Amenity only bar soap and towel.
3. Bathroom lock key is broken
4. There was a liquid soap and shampoo dispenser, but it was empty.
5. The women staff (the chubby one) seem not too friendly to answer all my questions.
6. The parking lot is small, and can only be occupied by less than 3 cars, and the others will have to park across the road which is open space and also only a small number of cars can be parked.","I have stayed here multiple times when visiting Denpasar. Reasonable priced rooms compared to other hotels.
Every room has private bathroom and kitchen.
Also they have a very large gym available.
Most staff can speak basic English to communicate and always happy to help.
However the hotel restaurant has been closed for several months now, not sure when it would be open again.","quite comfortable and nice place to stay. the room are clean, equipped with a fridge, private kitchen and bathroom. with an affordable price, this place is really worth to staying at. unfortunately, there is no water heater in the room."

I recommend to try their ordinary Ice Latte and Matcha, but if you Like tea, their signature tea is good!

The place itself has open space concept, so don't expect any air conditioning here. They have some outdoor places too, right before you enter the indoor area and in the back of the indoor area, quite spacious but also if it's raining, i might suggest to change your seat position to the one who is near the barista counter.
The toilet itself is okay, but they always ran out of tissue and there's random water noise that I can't figure out where it is. Honestly just bring your tissue yourself and hand sanitizer.

Overall i will give them fair 4/5, i really love their friendly service and it's quite new to experience what Muslim-Friendly place to hangout.","We decided to try this place as it is not too far from our home and have parking space.

As we entered the venue, we were greeted by friendly staff and given the menu after we chose d a table.

The serve a mix of western style food and Indonesian food and strictly halal so no pork nor alcohol.

The food were allright, very affordable, but you get what you paid for, so the portions are not very large. Since we did not try everything they offer, so we can only say about what we ordered.

The place also offers space for private parties (there was a wedding on the back when we were there).

Staff were attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere is quite allright.","Went to this spacious restaurant for the first time for birthday lunch with a friend and her son, and we both were served with good food and beverage. The coffee latte was good with generous amount of milk. Ask extra sugar for iced Latte, if the new staffs forget about it. They were, and I believe are, super friendly. French fries, Bitterballen and mozza cheese sticks were good. We had salad and believe me, they came with generous portions. Oh, the hot coffee Latte was perfect with a dash of brown sugar!

Some swings for children and outdoors seating for smoking are on the yard. Good place to hang out, and there is WiFi ( I know we can't live without it haha). Great experience!","Good food good service. The star is rice with oranges leaves. Also the oxtail soups.

They have 36 rooms but some of the tenants barely exist. Love the small balcony to sit on my bean bags and just read or listen to some podcast. They have 24/7 guards and CCTV too. Close to the Teuku Umar Street Food. The building is not deep down the lane. Approximately 100 meter from Jalan Pura Demak.,"Stayed for one year here. Nice facilities including hot water, fridge, and regularly cleaned air conditioner. But 1st floor was flooded during the rainy season and mice infestation since last July. Had to move out.",where is the contact person or WA number?,Nice place & best drink ü§©,Hmfood
