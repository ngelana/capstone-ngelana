The breakfast was very complete and with quite a few varieties. Very delicious dinner with an exceptional representation and flavor. At dinner the waitress Erna, a charming girl, served us and gave us all the details we asked for, very attentive and very helpful (thank you Erna).","Does not have a WOW factor however great value for money.
The rooms are clean and spacious - with jacuzzi and separate bathtub and the infinity pool is really nice. The bed was fantastic, very large and comfy!
The staff are very lovely and professional - even happy to communicate by Whats App, which is very handy.
Cons: it would be nice to have a kids area and the breakfast should definitely be improved - very little variety especially if you don't eat Asian/savoury in the morning.
Location wise, Jimbaran beach is really dirty, unfortunately however there are a couple of very lovely resorts and restaurants two mins walk from the hotel which can make up for it.",Amazing stay. I stayed here last week with my friends. The location is very near from the airport. The room was surprisingly big for us to enjoy the time together playing board games. They also have rooftop bar that connected with their infinity pool. Very satisfying.,Good value for the money. I love the rooftop poll and that it is to such close proximity to the beach. If you are willing to walk a bit you can also make it to the famous seafood area in Jimbaran beach. Breakfast is not bad either but the Latte at the time I went was not the best. Other than that I love the rooms and the staff is awesome. Nothing like watching the sunset from the rooftop pool and a the look out tower is great for pics! More @zsoltzsemba,"My wife and I spent a month there in Nov/Dec last year. We like the room, cosy, spacious and very comfortable. It was such a nice place, the staff were friendly, courteous and very helpful. The food is pretty decent. The roof top bar is superb for chilling with nice views.

What‚Äôs interesting is that there‚Äôs a tasting menu for first timer consisting of classics and a separate tasting menu for repeat visitors to keep things fresh.

From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted with impeccable service. Intan, our server, went above and beyond, noticing even the smallest details and making sure our evening was nothing short of extraordinary. She not only assisted us with every need at the table but also added special touches like helping with photo taking and swiftly replacing dropped tablecloths, making our engagement celebration even more memorable.

The atmosphere and vibe at Cuca were simply amazing. The drop-down curtains provided a cozy ambiance and enhanced our privacy, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the moment. It felt like we were in our own little world, away from the hustle and bustle outside.

Now, let's talk about the food. Every dish was a masterpiece, showcasing creativity and attention to detail. It was evident that each meal was well thought out, and the flavors were nothing short of spectacular. Cuca truly knows how to elevate simple ingredients into culinary delights.

And let's not forget about the cocktails. They were not only delicious but also beautifully presented, adding an extra touch of elegance to our dining experience.

Overall, Cuca restaurant exceeded our expectations in every aspect. From the exceptional service to the delightful atmosphere and mouthwatering meals, it's no wonder this place is a gem. We can't wait to return for another unforgettable dining experience.","Unique and memorable dinner in Cuca!
Romantic setup for my lady and we even had the honor to meet Chef Kevin in person, what a talented and experienced Chef whose passion is contagious and therefore, you can clearly see his creativity and leadership impacting his team positively!
Indeed both service and culinary experience were spectacular!
The flavors, textures, plating, etc. were remarkable!
The ambiance created is also superb, which makes it one of the best possible dining experiences in Bali. All ingredients are locally sourced.
Whether you are looking for a romantic experience or bring your family or even bring a large group, they can literally accommodate all kind of setups and tailor it to your preferences.
We will definitely be back!

Clean pools & reasonably priced cafe. Simple breakfast options but tasty & generous portions. 200m to the beach. Located on a quiet residential lane.,"We were upgraded to a deluxe room. Lucky? Not quite.
Rooms are outdated, not the cleanest.
Toilet and shower was the nicest view in the room.
On the other hand, the outdoor area, including the various swimming pools were 10/10.
Location is superb. A stones throw from the beautiful quiet beach of Djimbaran.
Customer service was knowledgeable and kind.","We really enjoyed our time at Bali Breezz. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating and the room was perfect. We had a couple of issues with the toilet, and the engineer would be there to fix it before we made it back to the room from the front desk. The food in the cafe was good. We really enjoy walking and exploring, so having a place set off the main road was nice for us. The pools  and grounds were beautiful. We were very impressed  with the accommodations for the price point!","Not a luxury hotel, but it is really cozy and has a lovely garden with 3 pools, a small cafe with drinks and food of good standard.
Breakfast is better than most hotels in Bali.
The staff are really helpful and friendly.
The hotel is strategically well located just 150 meters from the beach in Jimbaran.
The rooms are cleaned every day.  No problems using Grab for food delivery or for transportation.
Quiet and peaceful hotel without a lot of partying and trouble.","When I stayed at Bali Breezz hotel, I was met with 2 towels in the shape of a swan. I have never seen something like this in any of the hotels I have been to previously. The breakfast was pretty good and enjoyed eating it everyday.

The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the beach, but had a miserable day at the beach because it was bucketing rain. The hotel room was well maintained and had a unique outdoor bathroom with a shower with decent water pressure.

The hotel however does not have the best location because it is not too close to shopping malls like the sidewalk mall in Jimbarang, which would cost 35,000 rupiah in a taxi drive.

Overall, pleasant hotel and modest prices"

I like the friendliness of the staff.
I liked the quietness of the place.
I love the ease that it is to walk to the beach.
I like that this place does not have weird people staying.
Everything here is laid-back and chilled.
Pool is welcoming and easy.
Massage however was not so great.
Breakfast view is very simple yet relaxed.
This place is also very close to the airport so it's very convenient.
This hotel has officially become one of my favorites in Bali.
I will definitely be back.","We had a great stay here! The rooms and shared spaces (restaurant/dining area, pool, gym, bathrooms) were all very clean and managed by the staff. The breakfast every morning is delicious and they provide many options. Very big beds and the bathroom is also very big and clean. There‚Äôs also a shower next to the pool, a little space to play chess, and a massage service in the hotel.","What We Liked:
1. Huge Clean Room with Comfy Bed
2. Large Bottles of water
3. Dehumidifier in the room
4. Very quiet and peaceful. We slept very well
5. Long pool great for swimming laps
6. Excellent location, short walk to the beach and the seafood restaurants

What We Did Not Like:
1. Long check in time
2. Not enough seating area in the lobby so we had to stand and then sit on the ledge outside
3. Breakfast was very limited and small, not worth booking the room with Breakfast included. We had to go find more food at a warung down the road after breakfast at the hotel
4. Lighting in the room is not the best

Our Recommendations For Improvement:
1. Remove the clothing sales area from the lobby and install additional seating. 2. Install a second front desk so check in and check out can become more efficient.
3. Have a buffet breakfast and not the pre-ordered limited options that is  currently provided.
4. Have a look at improving the lighting in the rooms.",Nicely located hotel. Very quiet. Close to the beach. Two very good restaurants just on the other side. Rooms are clean. There's a good spa in the hotel. For breakfast you choose one of 15 dishes and also have a buffet to grab from,"I am lucky that the family room I checked in does not have mildew smell like what other review said and there is a dehumidifier in our room, there are two big beds in family room and can walk to pool directly, the pool water is warm and clean. I did a 90 minutes Balinese massage in hotel spa room, their spa room is big and good with very reasonable price, a 5 minutes walk to beach, you can have seafood dinner at beach side restaurants with very good price (550k for a family set dinner with fresh seafood and drinks), just about 10 to 15 minutes drive to airport, a good choice to stay before depart.

*breakfast can be improved... But with this rate, no complaints already"

The garden is nice but needs more care. The restaurant is next to the swimming pool and beach area, the beach is a public beach, if your kids want to play at the beach, beware of the stray/wild dogs. The breakfast buffet menu is decent, but it could be better, there is an empty long table in the restaurant which maybe used for putting more variety of menu.

Room is spacious, as pictures, but their toilet dont have a water hoze ü•≤. I cant do it with only toilet paper üòÖ

the surrounding area outside of the hotel dont really have much going on. So you either have to walk down the beach then get out to big street or take taxi to find shops or restaurants if you dont like having seafood for meals.

Their breakfast selection is very limited.
And when ordering the food from the restaurant, the food came out after more than 40 mins.

most of the staff is friendly.

The place is actually quite big, but I think their understaffed.

If they invest and work on Keraton Resort a bit more, it‚Äôs definitely can be a lux accommodation.","Very conveniently located, large rooms located in beautiful garden. Nice place to unwind and relax either on the beach or at the pool. Could be refreshed but for sure it is clean.
Big plus to be close the Flite School Bali - which provides great E-Foiling experience in the Jimbaran beach.
Really recommend to try it while staying in the hotel.","It‚Äôs a nice hotel with lush greenery. Rooms are big and clean but needs a bit of renovation. Nice pool with warm water to relax in!

Thanks again for making the stay here so wonderful and we hope to come back soon!","My boyfriend booked this place for us and I absolutely loved the complimentary breakfast in the morning. It was SO good.

We had a few problems with our room with no hot water but BUDI who works here, was so amazing and helped get that fixed right away within the hour. Because we were staying for 2 weeks, they upgraded our room the last few days because of the hot water issue and it was very kind of them to do that.

Budi was so incredibly helpful and I cannot say enough good things about him and this villa! It was a dream to stay here for our first trip to Bali and we will for sure be coming back!

All of the staff is very kind and helpful and especially Budi! They made our trip here so delightful!

I cannot recommend this place enough for people to stay :)","Our host/ manager COULD NOT DO ENOUGH for us, we were unsure of this place after spending time in another villa up north however this tured out to be better that the W and other resorts we stayed, we had a villa with private pool but on reflection we only needed a standard villa and moving us was no problem, we had breakfast served every morning to order and some üòÅthis was probably the best place here and I‚Äôm righting this the night before we leave üò©I ‚ù§Ô∏èthis place so thanks to all the staff, you did an amazing job xx"

Given the price point of only IDR20,000 per portion of meat, I would say that it‚Äôs fair value for money, though knowing the local living standard, I‚Äôm surprised that the locals are paying this amount for a meal.
Nice experience for a tourist nonetheless.","We went here as we were recommended by a local. And it did not disappoint. Greeted by friendly staff who were very welcoming. Everything was very tasty & fresh. Only wish I Had got more of the pork skin. It was so good & very crunchy. Authentic flavours. The soup that comes with it is also very delicious full of herbs & spices. Portion & price was also very reasonable. The seating & place to eat was very humble & homely.  Would highly recommend this place if you want to try Babi Guling, while in Jimbaran.",20k/portion you get a delicious meal. My best point goes to the soup and their crispy pork intestines. Best best best!! Better come here by motorcycle.,"One of the best Babi Guling in the area because the prices are cheap and you get plenty of meat here. The skin is crispy and the portion sizes are generous for it's price, you can get a portion for 15k and you can get takeout for 10k.

Service is also fast and you can order many different drinks there although the place is a bit hot because there are no fans nor air conditioning.","Delicious!!

Great service and friendly staff. We sat down to eat for lunch and had the dish that the restaurant is named after! It was tasty as, and it also came with a soup. The pork was delicious and we also ordered a local drink; Temulawak which is made from something similar to Tumeric and tastes like IrnBru. While we were eating, there was a non stop line of locals and the staff were very busy.
Would definitely go back here!"

It's away from the group of restaurants on the Jimbaran beach, so you get the peace and tranquility eating while watching a beautiful sunset.

Coming down to the food, it's great fresh bbq and Indonesian food. The portions are good, the price is reasonable and the taste is nice.

Overall, just the right experience.","WOW. Flavors so good, I‚Äôm still dreaming of the food!

The complexity it takes to cook to perfection, yet, keeping the dishes to its purest form.

Best food discovery in Uluwatu & Jimbaran. Go here. Eat here, enjoy the family and the music in the background.

Once you‚Äôve had 2 bites to many, as it is all to tasty to not eat, enjoy a slow stroll at the beach, walking off the amazing food.

On top of all of that, the prices are very, v√©ry, affordable - compared to the many other warungs and fish restaurants around the area.

Hungry for more. Don‚Äôt believe me for my words, go taste and experience yourself",Brilliant fresh food and so generous with the portions. We ordered a seafood package called Bayungan did not disappoint. Really amazing and friendly staff.
