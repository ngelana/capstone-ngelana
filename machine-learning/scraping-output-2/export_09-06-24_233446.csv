Because there are also real huts that are a little more luxurious.  With a real bed.  And a wonderful view from the terrace into the jungle.  the acoustics are stunning.  The boy is so quiet and calm.  Some cricket always has something to tell.  The operators are incredibly friendly and very reserved.  Here nature is in the foreground.  And your rest. The facility is a huge big boy where they grow coffee bananas mangoes cocoa.  The looks then also use in their meals.  The food is always freshly cooked and everything always comes from the garden.  Sometimes it takes a little longer, but that's normal. And somehow it fits the concept completely.  Everything is very lovingly laid out I like being here.  Unfortunately only three days booked.","Nice experience to stay in this place surrounded by various of coffee plants, cacao, fruits, and gorgeous flowers, jungle. Also there's a trekking path to the jungle if you follow the path from river down there near hammock. All the staff and owners are superb and nice to engage in conversation with them. Recommended. Will be back to this place if we stay in the Area again.","I have visited Kebun Kita Bali for 3 time. I really like the place because of its amazing and beautiful facilities and view. The food is also nice and everyone who works there make you feel like a family. Mbok Wayan is the best one, she really accomodate and facilitate our wishes and i am so grateful for that. Also others staffs are also nice but i didn‚Äôt get their names hehe.",Great food. Fantastic service in a beautiful environment. There are also lovely rooms in the tropical jungle if you need accommodation,"A beautiful place with very nice people and great food, for sure we'll be back üëèüëèüëè"

Very nice little Warung, where you can enjoy a delicious lunch sitting in the garage of the owner‚Äôs home. The owner has been a chef in Kuta for 15 years and returned back to his home town to cook here. Absolutely delicious :)","Gede cooks an amazing chicken nasi goreng. In all my time in Bali, it's in the top 2 for this dish. It hit the notes just right and the spice level was perfect.  I went twice in three days. Also, this is a very local place, so please bear that in mind.",,,
