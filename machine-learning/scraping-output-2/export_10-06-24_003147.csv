Jungle paradise.

Amazing resort which is just the perfect size.
Situated in the middle of the jungle and protected area.

Great lounging areas and facilities to explore (gym, restaurants, bar) as well as a fantastic pool area with super cozy loungers.

The rooms are decorated really nicely with huge beds and private outside areas.","Incredible resort, in the middle of the Bali Jungle, with an incredible view, perfect for a romantic getaway, very peaceful, beautifully decorated, every detail is thought of.  We stayed in the room with the private pool and it was spectacular!  There are a lot of treatments at the spa and many options to surprise your loved one in the most romantic way.  The food was delicious!  Each of the dishes we tried was full of flavor and at very good prices.  The cocktails are also very good!  The service was the best of all, each of our requests was resolved, always with a smile and the best disposition.  You can rent a scooter at the resort and go to the center of Ubud which is about 18, 20 minutes away.  The road is a little tricky but it is beautiful","My fiancé and I had an amazing experience here. The rooms and balcony have fantastic views, are super clean and spacious. The restaurant also has amazing views with delicious food and drinks. I booked a romantic dinner for the night of the proposal and it surpassed my expectations! Every staff member was so helpful and paid so much attention to detail. Again the food for this dinner was very delicious. I would highly recommend to stay here for any occasion!!","4 stars for this beautiful resort. Super nice and helpful people. The bar and pool area invite to absolute enjoyment and relaxation. The gym also appealed to me. The rooms are spacious and offer a great view of the valley. Unfortunately, the rooms don't quite match my taste (a bit dark), and the prices for massages and in the restaurant are somewhat high. That's why one star less. I think it's perfect for couples and honeymooners, but not as suitable for solo travelers.","The hotel is great! Very clean rooms and comfortable bed, amazing views and helpful staff. The only problem is the taxi, as per the local regulations of the village where the hotel is located you can only order local taxi which is usually overpriced and takes long time to come. Also the prices in the hotel a were a bit high for what they had to offer."

Must stay here! And I would love to come back again.","Loved our time at the hotel. It rained the first day, but luckily, the weather cleared up after that. The hotel surprised us with a small cake for my wife's birthday, which was a nice touch.
Impressed by the politeness and professionalism of the staff (As others have said, everyone knows your name by the second day 😊)
Special thanks to Made and Dekwan at breakfast restaurant and the staff at the front desk (for whom nothing was too much trouble) for making our stay memorable.","Everything about this hotel was perfection.  The food at all of their restaurants was always amazing. The service was impeccable. The overall atmosphere of the hotel was serene and idyllic. The activities we booked were fantastic, thoughtful, and thorough. We are already planning our return!","I am amazed by the quality of service at Como Ubud. It was an outstanding experience! Everyone is so lovely and kind. I enjoyed daily yoga, massage and relaxing time by the pool. We had our baby with us, and everyone welcomed her with open arms. I can’t fault our time!

The view from the pool downstairs is astonishing.  The breakfast was also great, and it is definitely a delight to eat with such an amazing view. Their restaurant is also nice and the prices are reasonable.
There isn't absolutely anything negative I can say about this hotel. I will come back for sure!!","Pros

Location: The resort is aptly located just outside the city center, so it's suitable if you're looking for some rest and quiet. The city center is about 10-15 minutes away by scooter/car. The hotel offers a free shuttle 3 times a day, so we used it to go to the city center one of the days. The rest of the activities we did required a car/scooter as they were in excess of an hour away.

Value: Breakfast is included. You get a buffet setup for cereal, breads and cold meat and order your ""mains"" from the menu, which is diverse, and every meal we had was out-of-this-world delicious.

Views: The resort has breathtaking views of the rainforest from the main pool and restaurant. Rooms 1-4 are located on the 1st floor facing the smaller pool while rooms 7-10 are located on the ground floor, also facing the smaller pool where you are able to walk out of your room and jump into the pool. Some villas have private pools as well.

Cleanliness: The rooms and surrounds were cleaned daily and thoroughly.

Staff: The staff was amazing. Very friendly and accommodating.

Cons

Accessibility: The resort has very many stairs, particularly if you're staying at one of the rooms at the bottom of the resort, so if you have knee problems, do consider this. They do have rooms that do not require stairs, with a pool just outside the rooms.","Gorgeous views! Great value for what you pay for. Quit a few steps to climb, as mentioned by other reviewers. But not a big deal. Could do with a little more cleaning. It does have a weathered or lived-in kind of feel to it, which adds to the charm.","This hotel offers an amazing view, it is like entering a different world to be honest. The location is fine given that all resorts are a bit out of the main tourist attractions. The staff is friendly, they arranged tours for us and supported when needed. Regarding the structure, it feels a bit left in time, maybe renewing things that look very old can help. IMPORTANT: not suitable for people with mobility problems. The hotel has a loooot of stairs, a lot.","A beautiful hotel build against a steep hill. Therefore every room has an amazing view. Service is very friendly and good. Rooms are large and luxurious.
Very good restaurant with beautiful view.

A lot of famous people stayed at this hotel in the past.
And I can understand why..."

The staff are courteous and kind.
Providing hand towels can go a long way in improving the experience. Additional towels have to be provided for kids.

One major problem I see is that the swimming pool does not have anything that stops us from getting into higher depths (it's really deep (7+ feet) and we can easily slip from the lower depth area to the higher one. I had to struggle to come out when this happened and it's really dangerous when there is no one around to help.","We had a nice stay. Staff is nice. You can ask them to bring your breakfast to your room (but you have to choose in the menu which one). Pool is nice, closes at 7 pm tho.",Highly recommend this resort. We stayed 6 nights in total. 3 nights in a regular suite and 3 nights in a spa villa. From the moment we arrived the hotel staff were welcoming and just lovely. They couldn't do enough for us. The pool was spectacular and we swam in it daily. The feel of the resort and the landscaping just beautiful. The bathrooms in the regular room were older and could do with renovating but they were cleaned daily. The luxury villa was the best service and luxury I have experienced. Highly recommend. The breakfasts were lovely. We ate out for all other meals. The rice field walk was spectacular.,Friendly and helpful staff. Delicious complimentary a la carte breakfast. Overall a good mid-range hotel. Spa is quite affordable  too.,"If I could rate it zero I would.
This is my own personal experience.
We went for a massage.
It was the worst massage I’ve ever had.
I appreciate they have been working all day, but the masseuse had NO IDEA what she was doing. It was a snelly room, unclean sheets. I Felt unclean. The massage oil squeaked when they rubbed the skin. My masseuse actually burped over me about 6 times. The bath in the room still had dirty bath water in it…!!!!!!!. Not sure if from the previous client. I felt very very unclean when I left (and I even had a super quick shower there). Maybe we got them on a bad day, but I would not recommend a massage here. I’m sorry for the negative review, but I would want to know this before I went there."

Just Dated and tired, and plugs not working, but bed is comfy and everything else is fine. The location is perfect and the pool is gorgeous, with a scenic backdrop of the forest, with a clear view of the Beji river. Service is warm. Breakfast is very basic but good enough for me. I came back here twice because of the service and location, but hope some improvements can be made to the rooms.","This resort has beautiful authentic Bali decor, peaceful jungle environment, very clean rooms, friendly and helpful service staff who even helped us carry heavy bags. You can rent motor bikes, eat at their restaurant which is very reasonably priced for very good food. The swimming pools here are great places to rest and hangout after many days of traveling. It’s a place you can come to rest, and consider staying more nights. My partner and I are planning to come back to this resort at the end of our trip because we loved it so much ❤️. The price is very reasonable for all of the above mentioned reasons and amenities they have offer. 15/10 for our romantic experience here.","I don’t know how this place has such positive reviews. It gets 2 stars for location but that’s it. THE MANAGER ‘ANDYKA’ IS EXTREMELY RUDE!!

The rooms are in terrible shape, there were lizards and mosquitoes in the rooms, the bedsheet had dried bird poop on it, the phone and TV did not work, power outlets were exposed, there were cracks and bugs all over the room and the BIGGEST ISSUE was that the A/C did not work. When we asked them to fix it or give us a different room, they said that they didn’t have a different room but they knew that the AC didn’t work and still gave us that room. They didn’t even have fans to help with air flow.

The manager whose name is Andyka is rude and acts like he is doing you a favor by trying to fix things for you. These rooms should be in perfect condition for customers, especially considering how much they charge for each room. At least the staff was helpful and tried to assist us but the manager was horrible.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME HERE!!","Room: Lumbung Family

The positive reviews for this place are really far too kind. Do not turn a blind eye to the other one star Google reviews here. It is really that bad.

My group of friends and I are not really particular about room cleanliness and condition as long as it meets a certain basic standard. Despite the low standards that we have, we still ended up extremely unhappy with our stay.

Despite the resort looking great on the outside, the room conditions are really at an unlivable condition that makes any positives that the hotel has redundant.

1) Water ran out completely (shower and taps) for 2/3 nights that we stayed and there was no one we can contact for each time. It was still at 10pm+ I mind you.

2) The bed condition was terrible with ants and mosquito wings scattered all around our bed. Heavy dust were all over the room.

3) My friend woke up with multiple red insect bites on his neck. You will here insect sounds flying around you.

You do really get what you pay for. A great looking resort in the pictures for this price point is likely to have some severe underlying issues under earth the see face.

The positive reviews for this place are really far too kind. Do not turn a blind eye to the other one star Google reviews here. It is really that bad"

The small side salad with arugula and mint was also bright and delicious. The staff was so nice and polite. We loved this place and were impressed with the artistry of the chef. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed, and we appreciated the breeze blowing through at midday.","It was really the best Italian restaurant in Ubud!

Burrata was creamy, lamb cutlets were perfectly cooked and the mushroom & white truffle pizza was so good with honey!

Mocktails were great as well! Especially the blueberry one.

Service is top notch and the ambiance was really chill with live music. Food is well priced.

Would want to eat here again but we must give other restaurants a chance","Made it to Uma Cucina for dinner one night. Lovely open restaurant with a terrific vibe.
I like the side lounge and bar that they have next to the restaurant where people can go and chill and then come to their table for dinner.

We ordered the roast chicken, the mushroom pizza and the prawn Pasta. The chicken was as best as any roast chicken can get, but the pasta was a stand out. The pizza was also terrific. We had the cheesecake which we all enjoyed and a lovely glass of wine.

All in all highly recommend!!","Excellent food and great service. The restaurant is in Como Uma Ubud hotel and is set in a lush green environment. Loved the food and the ambience. It’s an open air restaurant (no air-conditioning) but felt nice and cool for lunch and dinner. Highly recommend going there if you are in Ubud, Bali.","Popped in for dinner at around 8pm on a Sunday night and it was relatively quiet. Lovely relaxed open plan venue. Only qualm was that the down lights were far too bright and glared like spotlights on some tables which took away from the romantic/moody ambience.

They served complimentary focaccia and olive oil / balsamic which was a great start.  We ordered the arancini balls (with braised beef short rib ragu) which were excellent - served very quickly and tasted fresh/warm and the outer was nice and crispy. For mains, we had the salsiccia pizza (pork and fennel sausage) and bucatini ragu (braised beef short rib again). Both were fantastic but the pizza was a standout! I’m not usually impressed by pizza but others’ review pics of the funghi pizza is what initially attracted me to visit Uma Cucina. My partner and I agreed it was the best pizza we’ve had in a while - base was perfectly thin with the right amount of fluff and crisp. Flavour was also great and unique (sausage is apparently house made).

Didn’t have alcohol but tried the green tea mojito which was far too sweet."

There is a plenty of tables in restaurant and outside terrace. The service guy was smiling and tried to help me for order and service all  the time.

It was awesome super relax post office hour-sitting at their outdoor chair, watching super green vied, away from crowded city, and the food was awesome super tasty.

We ate dinner 2 day here and everything was really delicious. especially mandu, tteokbokki, pop chicken, pork belly grill, beef bulgogi bibimbab was perfect but beef bulgogi stew was the best.

The staff were very helpful and you can message them via WhatsApp and they’ll bring you food and drinks straight to your room.

The shower pressure wasn’t as strong and the bathroom light could have been a bit brighter. I looked at some recent reviews about construction noise. I stayed there before any construction so I can’t relate to that. Also it’s not wheel chair friendly. Be prepared to walk some stairs.

You can even ask them to decorate the jacuzzi full of flowers as well as decorate the rooms with balloons. They have different packages, just message them and they’ll tell you about it.",Very unique resort! We had a villa with the greatest jungle view. Waking up in the morning is just breathtaking. The view from the pool couldn’t be better. Construction work was going on but didn’t disturb us. Music on and chill! Don’t look at every detail for such a low price per night. The bad reviews are not fair in my opinion. We had a great stay of 4 nights and enjoyed it so much. The staff was great and delivered excellent service.,"We stayed in room 15 the more expensive one on the top floor for our anniversary and I was definitely worth the stay the views were amazing, they do room service as well but there is a few restaurants only a couple of minutes walk away

The only downside is that grab taxis can’t come this way as they only allow local taxis and they are much more expensive. There is lots of construction work going on around and I imagine it will be like that for a few months so bare that in mind wasn’t too noisy where we were as it’s high up and our the way","As long as there are constructions next door, don’t book! The advertisement doesn’t mention anything about this, but please don’t waste your money on this accommodation as long as there are constructions next door. We requested a refund from Airbnb since the constructions absolutely destroyed our experience here.

It’s very uncomfortable to sit at the poolside surrounded by construction workers and loud noises from heavy machines. They start at 8am with the heavy machines (impossible to sleep in) and work till 8:30pm.

I’m sure this place can be beautiful when not being bothered by all the noises, unfortunately for us, we did not get to experience that."

I had cosmic fizz mocktail which is perfect - not too sweet, refreshing! And Mediterranean Falafel Bowl - I sent this photo to my husband and told that every spoon felt like a part of beautiful symphony that made my belly happy!
Highly recommend and will come back.
P.S. little shop near the bar also has good items I took tantra oil and some hair products ;)","My friends and I went to this place for brunch in Ubud. I phoned ahead to book a table and I'm glad I did because it's always busy. Especially we're here on the weekend. The staffs are friendly and gave us wonderful service and they even hire staff with hearing impairments, which is commendable. The food was amazing and full of nutrients. No need to cheat on my diet— I can still get the foodgasm! We had sourdough pizzas, Salad bowls, Trio avo, Nasi campur, Ramen, pastas, kombucha and cocktails. The prices were very reasonable too.
Surprisingly, there's a kids playground and yoga class.
Thank you for a lovely dining experiences; we will be back soon.","Lovely vibes for relaxing after work. If you are looking for the vibes on the top above the food and service, i def recom this place. The location is easy to find at main road- no car parking space-better with scooter/bike. Wish they have an omega/organic pouch eggs on the menu as they claimed they are vegan resto. My tumeric latte came around 45 mins after I re-asked for my order. The shop was awesome inspired sustainability products! Love it","I wanted to hate it but…. It was so good! The vibe is so “perfect” it almost feels like it will be over priced and touristy but it’s actually so delicious, fresh, and reasonably priced.

I got the turmeric jamu and the portion was insane, and the noodles with mushroom satay. I’m not a veggie but I come here when I wanna feel healthy and still eat tasty food!","The best part about my stay in Ubud was  being able to eat at Dharmius Kula every night. Every single meal that my partner and I order was 10/10. I would rate them higher if it were possible. All meals were fresh, delicious, healthy, and visually appealing. The location itself was very clean, welcoming and the staff were very friendly and attentive. These are some of the meals that we ate and they were amazing: the mushroom pizza (vegan and gluten-free), the cheeseburger pizza with sourdough crust (vegan), the grilled mushroom shawarma (vegan), the banana pancakes and orange yoghurt (vegan), the fried chickenless burger (vegan), the mushroom and lentil ragu fettuccine, the nasi campur men dharma (vegan and gluten-free), and the middle eastern falafel bowl (vegan and gluten-free). I wish there were more location in other parts in order to taste more delicious meals. This place offered some of the best food that I’ve ever eaten. I highly recommend this place!"

A bit hard to find the entrance tho hahah.....

Love the cocktails hers too!","Visited after seeing reviews and wasn't disappointed. While the cocktails are pricier than other options around, the atmosphere is sleek and intimate, adding to the pleasure of tasting their unique creations. Probably the best place in the area for a date, it sure is worth stopping by for the drink experience.","This is a very special bar. We were thoroughly impressed with the carefully curated menu, the outstanding service, and the one-of-a-kind cocktails. The ‘Tomat’ cocktail stood out as a personal favorite – a unique blend that we had never tasted before. Another surprise was the quail eggs, offering a new and exciting flavor experience that we hadn’t encountered before. This bar is definitely worth a visit, and we’re already planning to return on our next trip to Bali!",Gorgeous cocktails in a stunning bar. The bartenders were great conversation and really friendly. We visited twice in two evenings because we wanted to try as much of the menu as possible.,"So happy to have enjoyed a couple of cocktails at this bar. They have got it SO right, down to the lighting, the simplicity of the bar, the atmosphere and of course the cocktails! Super impressed and will definitely be back 🙏🏼"

Service was prompt, food was fresh and delicious. Prices were very friendly as well! We started with some soup which definitely hit the mark. My wife ordered pasta which she loved and I had a pizza. Way too much food for 2 people but we felt like going crazy.
The pizza had good flavor, however it could have been baked just a tad bit longer. Overall they knocked it out of the park, we would love to come back sometime soon.","This Italian inspired restaurant was so good I went back a second night. The menu had so many interesting items on it! Delicious wine, fresh salads, and incredible bruschetta potatoes and baked penne-potato gratin (that I'll be replicating when I get home). They played lovely soft music and the back of the restaurant is open to a rice field so you can hear nature. Super friendly staff and an all-around lovely time.","We ordered the Fuzion Beef Burger and the Ai Funghi for delivery.
It took over 40 minutes before they started preparing the food. The food arrived about 80 minutes after placing the order.
Both meals were still hot and tasted amazing!",Lovely place for dinner! Delicious arrabiata pasta and a super tasty quattro formaggi pizza! Great service and excellent value!,"Amazing Italian restaurant, I’ve been there way too often. My favourite part is Appetizers, they are pure flavour bombs. Pizza and Pasta are also great, worth trying! Best cappuccino, accompanied by very nice cookie.
I wouldn’t recommend a burger though - it was ok, but it’s not their strong side.
Italian food is the specialty :)
Always friendly and attentive staff is a major plus."

Staff was kind and accommodating, living space was clean and spacious. Pleasantly surprised to have a little kitchen. We got breakfast included, simple but good enough.",Nice and pretty large living space. But extremely lazy and greedy owner who seems very burdened with his job. So you have to ask him 30 000 times to change gas when it's finished or to change broken bulbs before he starts doing anything. While he tries to increase price monthly his workers (who are mostly cleaners) don't get additions to their poor payment.,"Wifi connection doesn’t work.  The villa driver confirmed via WhatsApp the night before for airport pickup and didn’t show up.  Poor maintenance, cracked tiles, broken tv & broken shower.  Poor chlorination of pool lead to ear infection.  Mould and rising damp in both villas.

Just a little bit pricier than most places. Very amazing view! Amazing bathroom! Amazing tub. Great family compound that takes care of it.  Breakfast was tasty every morning. Our favorite was the banana pancakes. We felt very safe with their cameras and front desk staff. Anything we needed they tended to.,"The owner of this hotel was physically abusive towards me and my son! He has a report against him !

They were very rude and not good hospitality …. Like most Balinese now it’s about money not good service …..

Rooms are nice - little mouldy- but nothing else ! View is good

Cleaning very very non existent - no cleaning ….","It was one of our best stays. The room is spacious the bathroom is beautiful and the view is amazing.
The staff is more than welcoming and extremely helpful. A La carte breakfast with great presentation.

The location is very close to the center especially with a scooter. I’d definitely stay there again!

I’d definitely recommend renting a scooter from the lady in the grocery store next to the hotel on the road. She’s extremely sweet and helpful.","I believe we have some room for improvement here, the view was amazing yes, it's got this jungle view from balcony, to see the running river you will need to go down to the swimming pool area.
The food was ok, I think for the same price on lunch or dinner, you can get a bigger fuller portion in the restaurant or eatery outside of the villa, so we have not ordered anything for lunch or dinner from the villa after we tried that on the 1st day we arrived. However the breakfast was not too bad. If you got breakfast included, good on you, good choice.
Towards the end of the stay, last 2 days the wifi was not working at all, because we gotta leave soon so we could not be bothered to say anything.
The rooms were not really noise proofing, got some new guests checked in 4am in the morning, and we can hear everything, stomping, running, laughing, door opening etc, it woke us up.
Overall, for the price we paid, I think I will re-think my decision to stay here.
The service was not bad, the staff were polite.","It can sometimes be very busy in Ubud center.  If you like peace and quiet then this location is for you.  You can still be in the center within 5 minutes by scooter.  The ideal thing is that you can visit the hustle and bustle yourself.  The location of the hotel is ideal, there are many nice restaurants in the street.  The famous Naughty Nuri's, a charming Korean restaurant, room4dessert and much more.  The street has a crossfit gym, a normal gym and my favorite ""barbershop Balance"" is there.  The hotel itself is very beautiful.  It has a nice atmosphere and the staff is very sweet and helpful.  They are ready for you with whatever you need.  Like all the other rooms, ours had a kingsize+ bed, a beautiful bathroom and a spacious balcony overlooking the jungle!  You can see the sun rise every day.  The pool was great with a beautiful view and a nice lounge area.  Breakfast was delicious.  There is an extensive menu from which you can choose every day.  I would definitely go here again if when visit Ubud again."

Later you will see what I meant, even tho there are bunch of waiters at the entrance. So we fresh ourselves up in the swimming pool. And I wanted to order some drinks and food, for what they telling me “you have to pay 250k , 50 for pool, and for 200k deposit for restaurant” I be like wow. First of all that’s not how I should know about it. Whatever. Anyways I wanted to get some food. But still not professional at all. So I’ve ordered matcha latte & tuna pizza. I got it, While I was working I’ve ate half of pizza, and then had a call for less than 10 min. Once I was done, I took one piece and I saw there are small ants running on pizza plate and even under pizza itself. Place was wooden. So you actually have to get closer to see them. Anyways. I be like wth. Did I eat some of ants as well? That’s was my thought. Because I was busy, and wouldn’t even think it’s possible. So I’ve called a waiter. Gave him this pizza. Told him I’m not gonna eat it, and asked for a menu. I was pissed off. After that I’ve order a brownie and one more matcha. Well. They brought matcha and said “sorry for your pizza, matcha is a compliment” I be okay. Fine. Later on, when I’ve asked for a bill. I’ve check positions I’ve ordered. THERE WAS a PIZZA ON IT. When I said I’m not paying for it. She be like, there were ants, but it’s because you left it for long time. EXCUSE ME, I started to eat it once I get it, then I left it, well , let’s say maximum possible timing , 20 min, IT WAS WITH ANTS OVER THERE. Ants and flies. Alright. They cancel this pizza in my order. And she asked me about my friend who came for 10 min and was in the pool for some time. “Did he pay for pool? No. But he was swimming? I be like why the heck you ask me this question, your work is to tell people about the rules of the place you work in, BEFORE THEY ENTER THE PLACE” I was shocked from it. And super pissed off. Really beautiful place. But food and service is terrible.","250k per person 17$ USD haha for that pool in BALI?!?! LOL I'm not cheap but that's AGGRESSIVE, 150k would be fine...  This picture is not sun-kissed it's Bali Nguni 500 meters away for 20k, they should charge more but that's how bali is... this pool is almost as nice... the staff at sun-kissed seemed nice but go to Bali Nguni instead!! Great food there too, sun-kissed shame on you!!!",So lovely place to relax and enjoy the views! Staff are super friendly and warm!!,"Gorgeous poolside bar that is part of a hotel resort. Amazing service, great food and drinks, very pretty sunset views.

Great stop after our campuhan ridge walk. So glad we chanced upon this place. Highly recommend their smoked coffee negroni, oxtail soup and smoothies! The bar is very cooling as there’s no direct west sun, and you get beautiful views of the pool and mountainside during sunset hours.","Amazing Atmosphere and Service.

I had the opur chicken and the stir fried chicken with pineapple, both were competently executed.  Recommend the Kunyit Bali tea.","The food is sooo good! We loved all the food we ordered. We had the chicken noodle, chicken basil, chicken salted egg, chicken tofu rice, aglio olio, batagor (chicken wanton with tofu in peanut sauce), and shibuya creamy mushroom. All very good.

The staff give us the phone, to communicated with them. And there we did not have any television for 3 rooms.
I wondering, if the 3 rooms probide the television it would be good.
