Welcome drink, free water in the rooms. Lots of effort made to share the towels into a swan, flower petals in the room, etc. Breakfast was fabulous and you can order ahead to have it ready for you the night before. Pool is wonderful and so is the sunset.","I recently stayed at this hotel, and I have some mixed feelings about the experience.

Firstly, the room we had was decent and clean, but it was on the smaller side. It was comfortable enough for our needs, but if you're looking for a spacious room, you might be a bit disappointed.

One major issue we faced during our stay was the presence of ants and other insects in the room. It was quite uncomfortable, especially at night when it made weird noises.

The staff at the hotel were okay, but not exceptionally accommodating, especially when it came to our baby's needs. We expected a bit more in terms of assistance with our little one.

The property itself is relatively small, with only 8 rooms. However, the view from the pool area was absolutely beautiful, and it was a great place to relax and unwind.

One highlight of our stay was the smoothie bowls, which were amazing. Unfortunately, the food served at the hotel was only average, and there weren't many dining options around the area.

If you're looking for things to do, there isn't much in the immediate vicinity apart from taking a short walk to Crystal Beach. However, the hotel does offer the option to rent a two-wheeler for 500 INR per day, which can help you explore the area a bit more.","This place is a hidden gem ‚ù§Ô∏è. The owners are lovely and helpful. The villa was beautiful and well decorated with impresive wooden furniture, the bed was really comfortable, the breakfast and food from the restaurant was delicious, and the sunset from the pool was increbible. I 100% suggest to stay in Nusa Penida and you will not be disappointed to stay in this place. Thank you again üôè","It‚Äôs hard to convey just how special the Penida Sunset Bungalows are, and especially how wonderful the team are. We arrived there with my partner quite unwell after our earlier trip on mainland Bali, and had no idea how lucky we were to have landed there for his recovery. From the incredible views from the infinity pool overlooking the bay and peaceful, quiet surrounds to the delicious food and beautiful rooms. But what made it truly extraordinary was Gerry the manager and the whole team who really went above and beyond during our stay. They transported medication from 30 mins away for us, provided fresh coconuts each day for my sick partner, and regularly checked in to see how he was. We felt so very grateful and touched by their kindness.

In amongst all this we still found moments to explore and the team organised all our transport (including a last minute rescue from Crystal Bay!) as well as organising a massage therapist to visit on-site. They‚Äôve created something pretty remarkable at Penida Sunset Bungalows and we hope to visit again one day.","I think this is the most beautiful location in Nusa Penida. You have a perfect view to the ocean and you can catch the sunset before dinner. The rooms were so chic and very clean, the food delicious (just try the smoothie bowl, it‚Äôs mind blowing )and the staff extremely professional - always smiling and considerate. Our friend had her birthday on the day of arrival and they prepared a delicious cake for her and also we were welcomed with a watermelon drink. Gerry helped us with all transportation- both for transfer and for sightseeing. Many thanks to this whole crew for their kindness and for keeping the location so beautiful. We will recommend for sure to everyone coming to Nusa Penida."

Had an amazing time and hospitality at this location with beautiful facility. The construction is quiet new and very clean. Their service is of high standard and food is top notch. They are well priced and can be the the top destination in Bali.

Special thanks to Katut and his team for making our short stay very comfortable. Thanks Atalaya team ! Great work üëè","This place is fantastic!
We came to celebrate our first anniversary, and we'll be sure we come back. The location and views are perfect, the service is impeccable, and all the staff are attentive, friendly, respectful and diligent.
The hotel's practices are also sustainable, which gives peace of mind when travelling.
The food and drinks were outstanding.
Thank you for making our holidays so enjoyable.","1 bed villa with pool. Looking out towards the mountains and jungle. It's really beautiful, especially in the morning, with the mist rising up from the valley.
Villa was so lovely and really nice decor... very beachy vibe. Quiet and a bit romantic. The pool was small, so it was quite warm but couldn't help that due to climate. Weather was very hot & humid - very hot!!
There is the larger infinity pool near the bar, which is cooler, and the viee is stunning. Good photo opportunities.
The menu selection was small but really good. All nice fresh produce. Tuna steak was a favourite. Watermelon salad was good, too.
The breakfast was awesome with lots of choices.
Staff really nice & very helpful.
Crystal Bay & Gamet Bay only 10 / 15 mins from villa. We snorkelled at both - unfortunately, there was so much plastic in the water but some amazing fish.
We booked a car from the villa to pick us up & drop off to the harbour, which I would highly recommend  - especially pick up on arrival.
Can't forget Chicco the dog... such a handsome boy.
We would love to go back some other time."

Valley it's really close to Crystal Bay (a nice 10 minutes walk) and we also enjoyed lounging by the pool in the beautiful tropical garden. The room was good with comfortable bed and good shower.
The staff and owner (Nyoman) were friendly and welcoming.","The service was really great, very friendly and welcoming and attentive and the attended all our wishes and respect such as organizing transportation, massages, excursions etc.
The property is beautiful and in the middle of the rainforest very peaceful and quiet.
As it‚Äôs in the middle of nature it takes a while to get there logistically, but it‚Äôs beautiful.
The food delicious
Recommended.","We stayed here for only two nights, but upon reflections, we should have stayed longer. Nusa Penida is wonderful; you can do it in two days, but I think 3-5 nights would be better. This hotel is super clean, the room is very cute with a bathroom that feels like you are showering outdoors even thought it's inside; the staff is great. We ate here every meal while on the island and felt it was just fine; the food could have been better but that was not a deal breaker for us. We enjoyed having meals by the pool, taking dips, and running in and out of room easily. The pool is small, but deep so it's great for swimming. We will definitely come back here in May 2024."

The pool, the view, the bungalows, the staff, the service and the breakfast is just perfect!!

Especially Addi, the Receptionist and organizer of the place is a very kind and warmhearted guy.
He helps where he can and try to make your day as nice as possible every second. He can manage a lot of things for you, such as scooter rent, snorkeling and sightseeing trips. I appreciate being there very much!

5 stars +++
Would definitely recommend!","The best property one can get in decent amount. Beautiful bungalows in even more beautiful location. Although the forest view and the infinity pool takes all the attention, but the hospitality is next level. Too sweet caretakers special mention of Adi who was always there to help with a smile.
The only drawback which they have is they don‚Äôt serve lunch & dinner so one has to move around for the same ( which is not very far off).","Staff was so welcome and always ready to help. We were so surprised of our room and the view! Photos on the website can't really show the actual beauty of this place!!!
Everything was very clean. Nice pool and jacuzzi. There is even a little space, next to to the pool, to train with a few dumbbells.
Nice and healthy breakfast. Great position.
Scooter to hire available.
We would definetly raccomend this place!",We were unable to stay due to my husband having a dental emergency and they helped waive part of our cancellation fee which was very kind due to cancelling on the day. So grateful for this kind and understanding service.,"Perfect places to stay at Nusa Penida. Comfortable, quite places, near to crystal bay.
Spacious room with spacious bathroom. Somehow the pool is quite warm and you can see glimps of sunset there.
Full service with ""taxis"" that can giode you and arrange a tour of yourself.
Perfect basecamp for my Nusa Penida tours."

The room were overall good and very spacious and comfy, just that you need to ask for things to be done so the services can be enhanced from there side, there infinity pool with the jungle view is like no other its very very beautiful, we really enjoyed the view while having breakfast and also while swimming and the cool part that its open all day long. Keep in mind that there will be many insects because you are in the jungle.
They also provide Scooters that you can rent from them and also taxi‚Äôs incase you were a family, we rented the scooters for less than 10$ a day","Decent place, rooms could be cleaner and maintained better. That being said it‚Äôs a nice quite place to stay on the island","A really lovely place very close to the crystal beach. The hotel is new so that was a huge plus. They have an amazing pool with great view as well. Breakfast was simple, omlette, banana pancake, coffee, juice, fruit salad, but it was tasty. What could be improved is that it would be great to have a drying rack in the balcony. Also the drainage in the shower was not good.

A cheap scooter in good condition and with helmets we could also book directly trough the accommodation. 5/5

The only negative we have is that my girlfriend ordered the Gyros on the first night but it was just a wrap,  it sure if this was just a small mistake or if that‚Äôs what the gyros was meant to be. Maybe this needs to be looked into? And also my chicken in my curry was a little dry and unseasoned. All of which was reported to the staff so they can make the relevant changes!
