Ideal for families or couples looking for a peaceful, well designed place with everything you could need. Amazing pool right in the middle! Owners couple was very helpful! Loved it!!","We were two looking to escape cahotic Bali's touristic places.

We felt at home in Putu and Ni Luh lovely home.

Kitchen had enough to cook, two bedrooms with AC and respective bathroom. One bedroom has shower the other bath tub.

In Bali energy is contracted by a pre-paid package, Putu and Ni Luh quickly helped us. There is an alarm that goes off, just click the enter button and speak to them.

AC was working nicely and internet also. If you want to work from here, stable internet in all house areas. 30mb's per second is the average around the house.

Pool is super nice and their garden is magical, you have mini spots all around and a welcoming instructions to the house as delivery restaurants.

I recommend Warung, the Italian we didn't had a good experience with the food.

Warung ordered Chicken redang and it was delicious, just reach them by WhatsApp and Putu and Ni Luh can help you also if the number is incorrect.

We used the laundry service, my clothes were super well taken care of.

Watch out for the Geckos on your rooms as they can be loud and sneaky to get in or bring earplugs if you have light sleep, I was fine with it.

The path between the Villa and Lovina is nicely done by foot (I usually hike), for elderly people I recommend renting a scooter or a car while you stay here.

Easily could have stayed two weeks in a row, their house revels a lot of effort and care throughout the time they have been receiving guests.

Unfortunately couldn't have a dinner with them because we were super lazy and relaxed in their house meaning time went by really fast.

We also used the massage services, I recommend during 8/9 pm so while you receive massage you can hear the surrounding nature.

At night, if sky is clear you can enjoy the stars, super nice as there isn't light pollution around the Villa.

Beware of the street dogs if you walk at night, just use your phone flashlight and make yourself bigger as they are all medium/small sizes and like to bark because they are as afraid as you might be.","Great villa! Exactly the same as in the photo. Very clean pool, bathroom, bedroom, kitchen. The owner was very responsive and helped with all the questions we had. The most ideal accommodation in Bali. Many thanks to the hosts !",We went for a weekend to the see the dolphins. The villa is nice and very peacefull at the same tine is Not far from the Lobina beach center. The owners are very nice.
