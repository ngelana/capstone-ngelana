The open plan living area, huge lawn + pool was perfect to relax at and spend time together as a family. Rooms are clean and spacious. The Villa is surrounded by rice paddies perfect for morning or afternoon strolls. A huge plus is their massage area, of which we received amazing massages!! We had a wonderful catered bbq with traditional music and Balinese dancers from the local village on our last night, definitely a must at this Villa. They support the local village where they can too which we really loved. Would highly recommend staying here.",Had an amazing time with family and friends at this beautiful Villa in Ubud. Literally situated between the rice paddies with very friendly staff.,What an amazing hidden gem off the center of Ubud. The place was so peaceful and such a nice getaway. We brought our dogs there and they were so happy as had a big open garden to run around. We stayed in the garden villa which had an amazing view right when you're waking up. The staff were pleasant and very accomodating. They organized a massage for me and my wife and we absolutely enjoyed it. I can't wait to go back again and invite more of our friends.,"Had a wonderful stay at Villa Protea. Will highly recommend staying here. The Villa is everything you need and the friendly staff makes the stay even better. The villa has wonderful and peaceful surroundings and they offer a variety of add-ons such as massages, BBQ dinners and white water rafting and many more.","We had a lovely couple of days at this oasis surrounded by the sound of the river, massive trees and rice paddies. Complete peace and quiet. Not hearing the sounds of motorbikes or seeing people. Perfect for a getaway to revitalise and rejuvenate the soul. The pool temperature was always perfect, and the sprawling lawns are not only visually appealing but also great for activities and kids."
