Kintamani, Kabupaten Bangli, Bali 80652, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=14424040152491412278,OPERATIONAL,,campground,"campground, park, lodging",4.9,948,,"The incline leading to the camping area is very steep, but once you get there it is really worth it, the view is very beautiful. The sunrise is amazing! It is really cold at night and better you pack your own food because the food that only available there either fried rice or noodle only.","First of all the service is fast response, facility very well maintenance, very neat room, and the best of the best is the vibes and the view,, if you look for peace this place is no doubt üëçüëç
One thing maybe for you who bring electric cooking stuff, the electricity will often shut down because of the low voltage here, maybe the owner should upgrade the electricity but because of that I make a good decision to get a firewood and make a bonfire ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç","This place is such a hidden gem. Very quiet and good to have an escape from the city. But the road was challenging there. You have to be careful.
The restroom was okay, a little dark. Just dont expect much
The staff is really friendly. I met the owner's relative and he's so nice","The best experience I‚Äôve ever had. Stayed for one night in a tent, woke up with a beautiful sunrise, went for a hike. View was bautiful. Staff was very helpful and the breakfast is so yummy!","Stunning sunrise. My friend and I booked a night‚Äôs stay on a weekday and we were fortunate to be the only ones for the night. Host guided us via WhatsApp on the route we should take to reach the camp site. Drive only if you feel confident with steep roads. Overall a great experience, would recommend."
