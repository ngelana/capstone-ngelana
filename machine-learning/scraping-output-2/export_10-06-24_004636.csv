They didn't use Balinese name for their restaurant and instead using generic name ""RM Rajawali"" which means there is cultural assimilation in the foods. It can be shown in their main dish, nasi campur, that have milder spices than typical Balinese nasi campur and it tasted so delicious and we can choose between pork or chicken for the meat. If you're in Klungkung area make sure to give it a try.","Old but Gold, little bit spicy ..","We eat this chicken rice by accident. We dont know what to eat when we go back from sidemen. We ask for extra broth on the top of the rice. But they refused it because the broth come on the side. Which is okay for us. But one thing we need to highlight we feel uncomfortable because the staff are grumpy just because we are not balinese or they just too tired!?

We dont like their chicken rice. We still love ‚Äúnasi ayam men weti & nasi ayam ibu oki‚Äù.","Food is seriously good.
Staffs are friendly, probably after reading the comments here(?)
Ample parking outside.
Fan only but very comfortable.
Worth the trip all the way from Kuta for this."

The hotel itself is pretty good for the price. I think the most expensive room is 450,000 rupiah per night and it's a big room with big bathroom.

There is a restaurant just downstairs with free wifi (no wifi in the rooms). Complimentary breakfast for guests and they have good coffee. I've done a whole lot of work on my laptop in their restaurant and it's pretty comfortable.

Overall I would recommend this hotel because of the low price and solid internet.",This property tge best in klungklung. Cheap but adorable.,Cheap and no hot water also,Fine,

If you're looking for a taste of authentic Indonesian cuisine in a casual setting, Restoran Sumber Rasa is a hidden gem.  While I can't confirm the exact dishes offered at the Jl. Nakula location,  based on other branches, they likely offer a wide variety of Indonesian favorites. I would recommend trying their Nasi Goreng (fried rice), which can be customized with chicken, shrimp, or vegetables. The portions are generous and the flavors are well-balanced.  Another great option is their Ayam Goreng Penyet (smashed fried chicken). The chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and the accompanying sambal (chili paste) adds a delicious kick.

The staff at Restoran Sumber Rasa are friendly and helpful, and the prices are very reasonable. Overall, it's a great place to enjoy a delicious and satisfying meal.","The food is really great and I forgot to take pictures of it, I highly recommend it if you are craving Chinese food in klungkung and near here!",My fav chinese food restaurant in town‚ù§,Recommended when you have visited Klungkung...its located very near to kertagosa and easy to find...the food is delicious and the price is cheap...its place have a strong and free wifi...,"Served good food, fresh and quick"
