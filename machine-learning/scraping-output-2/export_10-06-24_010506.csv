Denpasar Tim., Kota Denpasar, Bali 80236, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=14864011264630734459,OPERATIONAL,+62 813-3887-8659,lodging,lodging,4.4,214,,"First lets be clear, the place by It self is beautiful.. and at first sight you think you are in paradise.. it's only up to the point where you NEED to use the kitchen (for example) that you notice how dysfunctional it is.
When we ask the girl in the reception if it was possible to get a pot, she was completely disrespectful and literally replied to us that if we need something we should go out and buy it.; and that the kitchen was by standards like that.
We also ask if there was a fan available, and she also denied to us in the same tone... as if she didn't want to deal with us.
After we asked for two glasses, and again it was impossible, according to ""the standards"".
Don't even make me start by the record amount of cockroaches that we found everywhere in the room, bathroom, kitchen and little garden.
Not only we are not extending our stay,  nor comming back but also NOT RECOMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL.

The rest of the personal where polite and very nice. It was only this girl in the reception","It deserves the money you pay. It's not like a 5 stars, but very good.
Most rooms are equipped with a kitchenette, if not all.","I was all set for giving this place a generous 3*‚Ä¶ and then we checked out.

We booked 2 weeks here and fell for a trap because of the price. If you‚Äôre a tourist, DO NOT stay here, there‚Äôs nothing to do, nobody speaks English and you‚Äôll have to taxi everywhere, being a pedestrian is VERY dangerous.

The room itself was okay. Self catering, we survived with just forks and spoons the first 12 days of the trip, then upgraded us to a knife the last 2. We had 1 chair to share between 2 people.

Our biggest and most infuriating problem was the family next door. We strongly believe that some of the rooms at this property are owned/rented out by locals. The family (2 adults, 2/3 kids) would like clockwork wake up at 12am every night and shout, argue, FaceTime, slam doors, kids running round, until 4am EVERY NIGHT. Including the last, when we had a long day of travelling the next day! I complained to reception, who seemed to understand the 4am and our room number, but she struggled to understand the ‚Äòloud and noisy‚Äô even whilst I was waving my hands around my ears. We basically had to grin and bare it.

We didn‚Äôt try the pool that looked like a water feature, or the breakfast (local supermarket was a lot cheaper).

When it came to check out time, we told her once again that our stay was terrible, she didn‚Äôt ask why, I don‚Äôt know if she understood us. That was after she made us wait, with our taxi driver outside so that the housekeeper could check our room. All because they didn‚Äôt have our card on file. I‚Äôve never experienced this out of any hotel I‚Äôve been to, it was very inconvenient!

Before you start thinking ‚Äòdon‚Äôt visit the country if you can‚Äôt be bothered learning the language‚Äô, I travel a lot. I speak Spanish and Italian, I‚Äôm not going to learn a language to every country I go to. Especially on a 2 week stay. We did use the google translate facility occasionally.

It says a lot when practically all the taxi drivers are confused as to why we stayed here as tourists.

Aside from this the wifi was okay, there was parking round the back. Grab was good.

** from our travel experience I would advise staying in Ubud. We have also been told Nusa Pedina is nice but we didn‚Äôt get chance to go. Sanur was lovely and Kuta was okay but very busy.","The room was fairly clean. There were no dishes provided for the kitchen. There was also no coffee machine, instead there were two packets of instant coffee. These were not replaced during my three day stay.
It was a bit hard to find. This part of town is very busy, but there was no noise back at my room which was nice.",I can say that it is the best place to stay in the city center. The room cleaning is successful and the staff is friendly. It is a place I would like to stay again.

Also when we came, there were big queue. we waited for 40 mins.","the noodles are delicious, the dumplings are what I like the most, i come at noon and it was very hot there because the place is outside.","The complete noodle is so damn great. The price is also affordable. But unfortunately, I waited a bit too long to get my food. Also, the chili oil wonton is actually good, but maybe the wonton is made first and wait for the noodles to be made, so it's cold and a bit hard. I was hoping for soft and hot wonton."
