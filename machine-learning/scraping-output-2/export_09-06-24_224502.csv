I arrived before noon and had it all to myself. The air is cooler l, so I didn't get into the pool but the mist and the sound of the fall was all I needed. It's not too steep to reach maybe 100 steps, with places you'll stop and take photos. I'd recommend it to all. Only a 20k entry fee.","It's a beautiful waterfall. Clean area and has very fresh air. There a local people selling coffee beans, saffron, and many more (local products) on the way to the waterfall.","A very short hike from the parking lot (search for it not this one) you will pass by a few local shops and eateries until you reach the entrance and pay 20,000 IDR for entry. Roughly 100m away is this beautiful, powerful and elegant waterfall that you should get up close to truly appreciate. Disregard the naysayers and see it for yourself, you will not regret it. And i must say that the evening scooter ride here was beautiful with picturesque views left and right while driving through clouds. Amazing experience!",A very short walk from the parking lot and you will see the entrance to the site. There is a small fee for entering the site. On top there is a bar and restaurant overlooking the waterfall. Very peaceful and beautiful.,"A great place for being immersed in nature and beautiful scenery. Pay 15k to get in and enjoy the hike to the falls. There isn‚Äôt much to do beside snap a photo of the falls, but the trail is very nice. Wear good running shoes. Not suitable for those who have a hard time climbing a lot of stairs."

Defo worth stopping off if you want some nice evening scenery,"They ask you if you want to do a guided walk for 250k, I politely declined because I was keen on just hiking solo. To be able to do that, they ask you to buy a 100K ticket and tell you it's a 5km round hike across the lake, accessible from the path down the stairs. Relatively expensive in comparison to other things, but I'm fine supporting them. Until I realized it was just walking a bunch of stairs down until the path visibly stops, I definitely looked around but nothing could be found (that wasn't completely overgrown). I walked back up, asking them about it, sadly his answer was 'the path is hidden, that's why you have to book an organized tour'. I suggested them to be open about this from the start, after which he returned to his colleagues and they all started laughing. A bit sad and very atypical in my experience with locals here who are generally lovely and honest. I would not recommend to book anything here. Just go 100m further up and enjoy the view.","100k charge to walk down (and then back up) a bunch of stairs. Small temple and lake view. No vistas, no hiking around the lakes, etc. Saw several people going into the woods with rifles. WTH! Was able to use my ticket to trek at the other lake. That forest was more interesting but the trail I was on le opened to a view of a gas engine running a pump and a bunch of trash.

Did not try to hire a guide but if you do I suggest going with a large group as the cost is quite high ($30usd)

You're better off going to a roadside warung and enjoying a nice drink/food to go with your view.","This the the point where you can have a view of 2 lakes and it does not require any payment to get the view.
There are some locals beside this location with animals like Bat and Iguana which you need to pay to take photo with them. Kind of animal abuse I guess.
There are also regular travel buses stop by here with tourists flocking over to take photos with the twin lake background, could be crowded certain time.","Nice place to visit to relax, chat with friends/family and take pics. You can stop to enjoy hot coffee and snacks as well.  There‚Äôs a hotel across from this spot also a restaurant in case you get hungry üòÄ"

I was lucky because i was the only person there. The story goes that the 2 lakes used to be 1 large lake,If you have a plan to banyumala waterfalls spend sometime here and enjoying the view especially After having a winding road and narrow lane from lovina. We try new route back to lovina via gianyar. Find people opening fruitstall selling local seasonal fruit,"Located on a hill overlooking the panorama of lake buyan and lake tamblingan(known as twin lakes) with mountains on the background. Great place to get the photos,having coffee and enjoy the panorama.","Great place to stop for a view of the twin lakes.  There is a fun photo stop here also.  They have swings, platforms and nests to pose in for single or couple photos.  Just don't sample the Jack fruit, grosssssss.",Beautiful hill overlooking the lake below

I've trekked with Wayan and the other guides since 2013, and developed solid friendships with the team over the years. On one trip we went right up a mountain past deer and so many mushrooms, stopping at multiple historic and sacred sites, and was told local lore and legends that I don't think many visitors hear. Another trip I took friends and we kayaked across the lake to another temple. What I enjoy most about this trekking business is the genuine friendship and humour of the team.","A superb guided jungle hike with breathtaking nature and temples. The journey continues after the hike as you cross the lake by canoe. Our guide was amazing, having a lot of knowledge of the surrounding nature. Price 250K per person. Duration about 2.5 hours (2 hours hike, 30 minutes canoe ride).","I have been trekking 2.30 hours with  Moyo this morning,in the jungle ,close to Tamblingan lake. Nice easy walk . Moyo is a very kind person, talkative,smiling,funny with a lot to say about Bali and balinese people,the kind of guide who like as he wants to share his knowlege with us.Thanks to Moyo we did enjoy our short trekk which ended by crossing Tamblingan lake on a canoe manage by fisherman. I recommend Jungle Amerta Jati Trekking point,and specially Moyo.",So natural..we can tach the real of bali whene you came to this place..make sure we will forgot every think of our problem of life.,Great moment with local guide Moyo. The 3 hour trekking is fantastic.
