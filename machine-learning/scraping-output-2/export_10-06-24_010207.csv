Very reasonable price - 22rb for the paket spesial.

Great venue and location, relaxed and comfortable up on the second floor with chilled music and vibes.

Highly recommended. I would definitely come back here.","If you're craving a clean taste bali guling, this is for you. The spice is not excessive, just the right amount and it's not too spicy. You can still taste the balinese spices along with juicy pork meat and tasty pork crackling. The overall flavour is savory and sweet. The price is cheap too for this quality. Overall, a very nice place for babi guling.","Taste very good, friendly staff, not recommend when you using a car. There is 2nd floor seat.","A place where you can find delicious Balinese food. They provide chicken and pork. But, highly recommend the pork samcan. Must try!","Best Babi Guling you can get in Bali !

Simple, like it was made and served in Kuta some 40 years ago."

I learned so much about Balinese culture, family, religion and of course food. The whole process from going to the market, learning about their home, offerings, religion, food, and finally cooking was the richest experience I have had in Bali so far. The food was incredible. We were a group of 7 and the family was so patient with us. Thank you again! Suksema!","My kitchen shy husband and I booked onto a Balinese cooking class and it did not disappoint! Possibly the best experience of our trip was learning how to make Balinese food from scratch. Wayan and his family could not have been better hosts. We had genuine fun with them and came away with full bellies and some great recipes, no excuses for the hubby now :)
Anyone wanting an all round entertaining day should definitely book a cooking session with Wayan at the Tumang Bali Cooking Class.","So much food, so much fun. Master chef Wayan and his family made us very welcome and introduced us to Balinese food and life. We also got a tour of the nearby food markets and the rice fields surrounding the home. He explained so many things and tried to answer all our questions. Such an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend it.","Beyond awesome. Authentic Bali. You can‚Äôt taste food like this in restaurants. Give yourself a true culinary experience , heaven for taste buds! üòã

On top of this Made and his family are just the nicest people imaginable. Strongest recommendations!","Such an amazing cooking class! Wayan is great, explain everything before we cook. A lot of food and option in a peaceful place, with terrace views and lovely atmosphere. All the family very kind, we had an amazing time with my brother! I recommend to anyone in Ubud!
