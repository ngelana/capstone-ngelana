Unfortunately I could only stay 1 night, but I will try to come back next time. Thanks again dear family üôèüèº",The worst place I stayed in 6 years of visiting Indonesia. Staff are lazy and strange. Lifers staying there are schizophrenics. Money better spent elsewhere.,Great place to stay in calm area but nearby Ubud. Rooms were nice and clean. Special mention for super nice host :),"Great place to escape from the city life. Cheap price for quite large room, great wifi, and running hot water. Great exterior architecture.
Although the room has some damp spots and one that has no AC can be a bit hot sometimes.","Quiet, decent for the price.

I spend many mornings and evenings there. The smoothie bowla were my favorite! The staff were incredible, they took such good care of all their customers! Especially hary. I definitely recommend this place if you like cheap brunch, food and drinks! This place is also great for a evening vibe, playing some pool and listening to music with friends. Miss this place so much! Will definitely be going back üòçüòçüòç","We rented a villa with 8 people near the cafe when we found this place by accident. Every day we would have breakfast/lunch here and most of the days also diner. Hary even held a BBQ for our group on one of the nights. Great food, amazing service and good prices.
Hary, his wife and his daughter give this place a nice familial feel. Would recommend this place to everyone staying in Ubud or coming through it.","Great little cafe next to some rice fields. The food is amazing and is made by Hary who is a passionate chef. I always get the big breakfast with bacon, eggs, toast, mushrooms, tomatoes, and sometimes sausage, it fills me up every time.
