No breakfast under 9 am, and the restaurant is not even open at 9 am. I missed breakfast 2 days in a row.

Smokers could smoke in the lobby or on the rooftop beyond the third floor, there was an open space with a very good view.","Wide and clean room for the price. I paid 23AUD. It has a window to get some sun and nice desk. Safety box and kettle as well.

It is quite far from touristic area. If your trip is short I dont recommand this. But if u looking for cheap place and have time then all good ‚úåÔ∏è

You won't go wrong here.","What a big portion for me üòÜüòÜüòÜ I couldn't finished it my Carbonara Creamy. Taste delicious. Many people came here when i was here.

I definitely wanna go back again. To try another meal. The staff are nice. Far from the beach, closer to the Teuku Umar area.",Absolutely amazing food! Really good price for value and huge selection of foods. Went for dinner and breakfast and was a 10/10. Also the coffee was one of the best I had (I got a oat cappuccino).,"One of the best pizzas in town with semolina flour and a perfect baked to perfection. Penne Alfredo was simple and great. Crostini with burrata too much butter separated from the scarce cheese. Great strawberry juice and more than average German beer. Only problem was the polite and smiley service didn‚Äôt let us know about all the items missed in the menu. First, we ordered burrata salad, all sold out, then Greek Salad, when they told us again no more salad. But in general, nice place with easy parking and very good meals."

1. The hotel conditions are veiled and when checking in you may encounter unforeseen conditions - be careful!

2. Managers who advertise on Facebook stop responding altogether and ignore requests!

3. On the second day of our stay, in the evening the water was turned off - there was no water at all!

4. On the third day in the morning the electricity was turned off!

Every day something happened: a power outage, a water outage, noise due to some work, or a flooded toilet!

Even though the Facebook ad says they are animal friendly, they charge money to post them!

BE CAREFUL - this is an unscrupulous hotel, I do not advise anyone to go there!","The room is super hot and while i open the air conditioner stay inside waiting for the room getting colder suddenly black out,‚Äônever knee about the electricity here in bali but i think they put some number in it,i think for the management need to take a cause about this stuff because it is not comfortable for me
Luckily im only staying for a day,i will look more places to go and need to see from the google review for this place,there is a lot of bad review
And ya lastly the pool is dirty","I have stayed here for a full month and I have a very mixed feeling about it.
Location is great, it‚Äôs quiet here yet not far from centre. Plenty of parking spaces for scooters and cars.
Room are spacious with all that might be needed for longer stay. There is a kitchen but in Asian style - outside. So it‚Äôs hot, a lot of bugs and it‚Äôs ‚Äòlow‚Äô; as a person from Europe it was too low for me and I had to bend to cut or prepare anything.
There is no shower in bathroom, only bathtub. And endless mosquitos goes in through the constant open window (what is normal in Bali, you can‚Äôt close it).
Staff is friendly‚Ä¶ but slacking a bit and not accurate with cleaning, I often had to correct after them.","I recently had the displeasure of staying at the Villa Apartment, and I must say that my experience left much to be desired. While the staff was friendly and accommodating, it became evident that their primary objective was to take advantage of guests and extract as much money as possible.

First and foremost, I was appalled by the management's blatant attempt to withhold my deposit for any flimsy reason they could conjure. It seemed as though they were actively trying to find ways to keep the deposit, disregarding any semblance of fairness or transparency. This behavior left me feeling cheated and distrustful of their motives.

Furthermore, the pricing of the rooms was utterly unreasonable. I was shocked to discover that I was charged a staggering 10 million rupiah for a room that was barely worth half that amount. The quality and amenities provided were far below what would be expected for such an exorbitant price. It was nothing short of a blatant attempt to exploit unsuspecting guests and line their pockets.

To make matters worse, the management's obsession with petty details was both baffling and frustrating. They meticulously counted every single veneer floor, pillow, and spoon in the apartment, as if they were desperately searching for any excuse to charge extra fees. It was a ridiculous and unnecessary ordeal that only served to highlight their unscrupulous business practices.

Lastly, the cleanliness standards at the Villa Apartment were abysmal. Despite claiming to provide cleaning services, their definition of ""cleaning"" was limited to tidying the bed while neglecting everything else. The apartment was left in a filthy state, with dirty dishes, unclean surfaces, and an overall lack of attention to detail. It was evident that they were more interested in making a quick buck than ensuring a comfortable and hygienic stay for their guests.

In conclusion, while the staff at Villa Apartment may appear pleasant on the surface, it becomes clear that their primary focus is to exploit guests and extract as much money as possible. The exorbitant pricing, relentless scrutiny, and subpar cleanliness standards make this establishment one that I cannot recommend. Save yourself the frustration and seek out alternative accommodations that prioritize their guests' satisfaction over their own financial gain.

Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the numerous five-star reviews you may come across for this establishment are highly suspicious. It seems that these glowing reviews are either fabricated by the staff themselves or by random individuals who have no genuine experience staying at the Villa Apartment. It appears that there is a concerted effort to artificially boost the business's reputation, further casting doubt on the integrity of the establishment.

Furthermore, upon researching the owner of the Villa Apartment, it became apparent that they own several other hotels, most of which have similarly negative reviews. This pattern raises serious concerns about the owner's commitment to providing quality accommodations and suggests a consistent lack of attention to customer satisfaction across their properties.

Given these circumstances, I strongly advise potential guests to exercise caution and consider alternative options when seeking accommodation. It is essential to prioritize reliable and trustworthy establishments that prioritize customer service and deliver on their promises, rather than falling victim to deceptive tactics and disappointing experiences.","The room was excellent except the bathroom could use more attention in cleaning, however, we are still able to handle it. We love the place overall as it was way beyond our expectations from the prices we paid especially including breakfast! I would highly recommend anyone to come to this place for an affordable trip to Bali and explore the island. Relaxing within the property for a day or so is good too especially by the pool. When we were there, it was not crowded at all, thus, why I thought it is a good place to relax within the property."

The staff was so  kind to receive it  and bring it to our villa.,"We rented the largest villa for our extended family. The villa was spacious with a private swimming pool, a comfortable living room, and a dining area. No major complaints during our stay; we enjoyed our time at this villa.

Some notes that the management could use for improvement:

There were many mosquitoes in the room, possibly due to the open toilet, which was quite bothersome.
The bathroom towels were starting to wear out and seemed to have been used excessively. It's time for a replacement.
The breakfast menu was standard and could be improved.","Really Bad Service provided by the Villa. You will not get the service for which you paid for. The staff and the manager/owner is very rude and after 10pm only the security personnel is available, so if you have any issues with anything you have to wait till next morning till the staff arrives. I had the cooling issue with Air conditioning in the provided room, and upon 45min-1hr after complaint in the alternative room provided by the security personnel which has the same issue with poor cooling from air conditioning.",Overall very good rooms and service.. But location is a bit far from the main area.. And main point is no dinner is available..kitchen is there to cook food..ambience is superb..

Contain most of the chopped chicken, lettuce, and onion with curry seasoning.

But it's dry for me, I think it needs more salt and sauce in it. They gave me 1 red salsa and white seasoned mayo, it taste ok but too little.

It's worth the prize as the size, could make your belly full.

Good value for money through and through. Well done!","Absolutely lovely little cafe that is unpretentious and serves affordable food and drink. Its near where i live and found it randomly on google, glad i did.

I had a keto breakfast with eggs, mushrooms and potatoes. Coffee was also pretty strong. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Go!","Sorry for the 1 star. But I think they deserve it.

I went to this once place few years ago coz my friends brought me there. Today i went there with my bf coz we're just moving in the area and accidentally find this place.

We ordered juice was good and we ordered keto breakfast with fruit salad.

- First it took ages for the food to come where there were only 3 other customers. The fruit salad came literally 40 minutes later and it was the worst fruit salad. They put shared cheedar cheese on the fruit without honey, yogurt or anything. My suggestion is they should put nothing instead.  My bf is a cheese lover but didnt think it was good and he were rather disappointed.

- 2nd, the keto breakfast finnaly came after 1 hour and it was waay too salty. I had to spit out because it was tasted like just salt. When I told them it was to salty in a nice way. They dont even come to my table to ask, apologize or do anything.  Come on its just an egg which cost less than 2k per egg and they cant change it while charging almost 50k for small omlete, tinny bacon which cut into tiny pieces, a bit a mushroom,  few cut of potato and tomato. They literally choose to ignore me and just ask from the chasier desk what and which part salty.  I told them the omlete , the mushroom, the bacon and the potato aswell.  The mushroom partly salty but the egg is imposible to eat. I told them maybe you pour too much salt powder on top? And she said we never pour salt on top (which i can clearly see the salt shining like crystal on top of the fried potato you can see from the foto).

We ended up not eating most of the food tho we were starving and wasted 1.5 hour sitting in their uncomfortable chair.

Then when we paid, They charge me full price which i expected. But they didnt not even apologize or say anything for serving me this terdible food.","An affordable breakfast place that located quite hidden from main street, usually crowded with people when breakfast time. I ordered their sandwich, they taste pretty good but overly salty. Gonna come again to try another menu.","Great place for breakfast.
