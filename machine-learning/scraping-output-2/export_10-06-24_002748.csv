The rooms are clean and very comfortable, the food in the morning and evening is wonderful. I miss Rendang and Sate with peanut butter :D. We really liked the two ladies in the morning :) We were able to book a massage in our room, a scooter and we were helped to organize a cab to the doctor. You have a lot of peace and quiet here, far away from tourism.
We would love to come back :)","We spent three nights here.

The room was like the pictures, private and very nice. There is also a Pool available.

The food was super tasty and we recommend to eat here instead of eating out. But be aware that depending on what you want, you have to order it the day before.
We were able to rent a scooter for a good price and saw so much from this corner of Bali.

You have to be aware that you are  in the jungle. there are lots of animals and the bathroom is completely open to the outside. Also in the bedroom there is space between the wall and the roof where animals can come inside.
Because of this the air condition has hard to Work and could not cool down the room properly.

It is a really beautiful place with very welcoming hosts. We really enjoyed our time.",Breakfast in a beautifully tranquil restaurant with water features and overlooking the garden...strong WiFi too.,"Very nice villas. We stayed 3 nights. Clean room, comfortabele bed with klamboe, nice shared pool. Friendly staff and good & save location. Good breakfast. Nice restaurants short drive away.

Small parking, but you can also park on the street.","I grew up going to Bali and staying at Rumah Kelapa reminded me of all the reasons why those trips were so special. The beautiful gardens, the gracious hospitality, the clean and comfortable rooms, and the hum of nature.

My 3 friends and I rented a car so we would have a delicious breakfast at Rumah and then head off to Virgin Beach (it's incredible) most days to come back for an afternoon rest and swim by the pool before a relaxing and yummy dinner.

So, if you dream of what Bali trips used to be - look no further. It's magical."

Seating a bit noisy with traffic right on made road.","This place has a really interesting concept, mixing a bunch of businesses - restaurant, gym, and motorcycle shop! We came for dinner and enjoyed our meal. The Balinese dishes  excellent, the portions large and the prices good. The service by the young waitress was very professional! Excellent experience and we plan to return again in a few days for another dinner!!","Nice food, not a lot of plant-based choices of course. Went with the fish soup with vegetables and a very nice vegetable side-dish with coconut which wasn't even on the menu as a standalone but as part of some menu for 2. The menu had pictures which is a big big plus. The smoothies were awesome. They made them without sugar for me and watermelon was the best. Had 4 of them üòÖ","Looks like it was run for westerners as a western bar so sometimes in Asia that can be a bad thing as the food is burgers etc but the Indonesian selection was super delicious! We got the chicken package and it was all done very well and the sambal with it was nice as the soup! Satay sticks beautiful as well as the whole butterflied chicken too.

Added little addition of an amazing band too - we had a guy play harmonica who is usually making fabrics during the day so a lot of love for these guys!",Huge range of amazing Balinese dishes. Well worth repeat visits to eat your way through the menu. Great for a drink with live music weekly. Highly recommended!
