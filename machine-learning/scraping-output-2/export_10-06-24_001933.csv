We were looking for early lunch before the rice fields and this place ticked all our boxes - we were able to enjoy the view and entire upstairs patio to ourselves for the entire meal since it was early in the day.
Food was wonderful - the smoothie bowl was fresh and the fruit cold. Eggs were perfectly poached. Juices were fantastic and exactly what we needed after some NYE partying.
Definitely worth a stop if you're outside of Ubud looking for a meal.","It's an amazing place. The food, cocktails without alcohol, the atmosphere, everything is at the highest level. If you are in Ubud, be sure to visit this place. It's especially wonderful here at lunch!","This place is absolute üî• BEST RESTAURANT we've been to in Bali! We had the jackfruit tacos which were so unique, mmmmm almost ordered another order but we got full from the AMAZING grilled salmon dish, an amazing Price/Quality  ratio! The pumpkin coconut soup had my wife licking the plate!! I see some people complaining about price,  jeez ... if you are tight on money go get fried rice from some warung down the street and head back to your 12 man dorm,  if you want some amazing food with service just as good and an ambience that can't be beat then come here.. I GUARANTEE YOU WON'T REGRET IT! The manager came over and talked and I brought up covid and how it must have tore up this island and after pulling teeth he admitted the english owner kept the employees working during covid which is very admirable, what a good lad! Thanks for your service from Chicago brother I wish you success!",This cafe is stunning! The design of every corner of this place is just wow! Eco/organic design and a Balinese twist. An architecture lover‚Äôs dream! The food is also delicious (I was surprised since I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be great but it was very good! - I got the cassava gnocchi). Highly recommend!,Akasha is stunning and peaceful!! We came during the afternoon and there was barely anyone in the restaurant. Low sound in HD here so the gentle music in a gorgeous natural setting was a huge plus! I thought the food might not be on par with the design and location but I was wrong. The sweet potato gnocchi was incredible!! Good portions too. Overall a wonderful experience!!

We had such a wonderful morning with Gusti. We booked a batik class and he was such a patient and kind teacher, with the emphasis being on having fun and learning a new skill. Gusti is very passionate about art and sharing his knowledge and skills with other people. We booked via WhatsApp (number on their website) and went for the 9am class and there was just 3 of us, how lucky we were! Thank you so much for teaching us, we will treasure our master pieces!","Highly Recommend!  I had so much fun learning how to batik and making my own batik. Gusti, Wayan, and Wayan were amazing. I will return for other art fun!  Amazing fun afternoon!  Thanx guys.",Such a fun morning learning about Batik and getting to paint our own was a lot of fun! They turned out beautifully and a really fun experience and can‚Äôt recommend it enough.,"This studio is magical. We did the batik class and our instructor Gusti was so so lovely. He also happens to take amazing videos and pictures!
The class itself was 10/10. We also ordered lunch there and it was the most delicious, home-cooked Balinese meal I‚Äôve ever had. I will hold onto this experience forever, truly recommend it.",The Keliki Painting Workshop was a refreshing experience. The instructor was calm and creative. I left the workshop feeling inspired and with a newfound sense of calm

Ayu and her team were super lovely and accommodating, bringing fresh fruit and breakfast every morning. Short drive to Ubud centre with an array of bars and restaurants. We loved our stay and look forward to returning again in the future.","A gorgeous villa with amazing swimming pool, luxurious bathroom and beautiful view of the rice fields. Staff were super helpful. In a great location a short drive from Ubud centre, the rice terraces, and Mason elephants.","A serene extravagant home away from home. Every amenity provided exceeded our expectations. Starting from the traditional Balinese polite welcoming and genuine smiles of the staff greeting us as we check in. This in my opinion sets the stellar standard of accommodation that we will be experiencing. Ayu (Putu Vira) our charming host/Butler is super amazing, she is with a genuine smile whenever we interact with her. She's immediately available by way of phone or messaging apps. and provided us of anything we needed within 20 minutes or less. Ayu also offered to be the driver should we need to be driven to the grocery stores as well. The daily Villa housekeeping procedure is super clean. There is always a guard on site at the entrance of the Villa starting from 6:00 in the evening to 6:00 in the morning until the regular staff arrives which makes the Villa so secured. I wish I can give more than 5 stars. We will definitely look forward to staying here again in the future. Thank you so much Ayu and staff for adding to our awesome vacation in Bali.",Awesome! We stayed here 4 years ago and it was our favourite villa on our trip so we were delighted to get the chance to spend more time there. Great accommodation all round and very helpful staff. Really really clean and well maintained - the pool immaculate. There‚Äôs also a great spread for Breakfast which is usually included in the price. Would highly recommend staying here. The only downfall is that it‚Äôs a little from the town but still only a short ride away.

Our hosts Wyanne and the owners of the property were very friendly and will do anything for you just ask .Wyanne was happy to assist us with anything we wanted..
This property cannot be faulted. Stayed at many many resorts but none compare..
Not only is it quiet restful and peaceful but at night the fireflies come out over the rice paddies and gave us a magical dance of nature..
We will be back thankyou so so much for this lifetime memory.
