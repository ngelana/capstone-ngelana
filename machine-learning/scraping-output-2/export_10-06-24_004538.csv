Sitting alone and in dirty cages. Those poor animals have to sleep on bars. These beautiful animals deserve to be treated better. But because there is a need to make as much money as possible, these animals are locked up. Shameful. Don't sponsor this.","Nice view (local plantations), good explain about processing luwak coffee"

He explains everything to us very carefully and offering free tea tasting in the end. It is a great experience watching how the famous Luwak Coffee is being made. Prices of coffee and tea are reasonable. Highly recommended.","Very nice place. The owner kindly leads us for a tour, explaining every detail. Many choices of fresh tea. The coffee is excellent. Very good price too.","Such a nice place to visit, we had amazing experience thank you so much for everything ❤️❤️❤️","A small plantation and coffee/tea shop with nice stuff! Deliastuti (thx you!) hosted us warmly, walked us thru plantation thoroughly explaining coffee production process and showing great variety of plants. Luwak coffee is 60k/cup, tour and other coffee/tea degustation are free of charge.
It's worth to stop by if you are in this area.
There is no coffee plantation here, just a few arabica/robusta bushes.",Best coffee and excursions!!

But when we have to talk about quality, it's really need high attention.
A lot of foods was sold out at 4PM, gurame, prawns etc.
The food was far below expectations. There was nothing special. The soup was too salty, we cant eat it. The noodle was too sweet and only dominated by soy sauce taste. Mojito was not nice, fantastic4 was weird.
It's really dissapointed, considering its too pricey.","A very m very pleasant surprise on my way to Tabanan. The first ever warung what has amazing ambiance, beautiful place sit. The staff is from highly training. English spoken, Manager and the friendly owner. Make you feel welcome.
It's only open for a short time in this new setting.
I would advise you to take this opportunity to enjoy this place. The food is superb, I love personal more traditional Balinese food. And they have it. Beside the western menu later this month.

The price is little higher, but I must say! You pay also for the great ambiance and service. Well spend money I would say.

For me as Blue, it's nice to know this place.

Please ask for the manager, a very well spoken man.

Compliment for the owner, well done Pak!","It's conveniently located next to Taman Ayun but it's a very expensive place to eat. Their drinks cost from 35k-55k and their cheapest meal is at 45k-55k  depending on the add-ons you'd like to have and there is a service charge.

The ambiance however is terrific. You can eat in a bungalow sitting down or in their dining area with proper chairs and tables. This is probably why the food is so expensive.","Popped in to buy some tea/coffee powder but was roped into the tasting session.

Received the speech about the Luwak coffee, how the coffee is made etc etc, and whilst it's a nice experience to try out all the flavours, we all know the coffees and teas are made in the same place for every single one of these places. The shame about this one is that the tasting table is hidden in the far corner","Place was cozy...but food n drink need a lot of attention...order bar bara, avocado jc, fantastic4, pisang mozarella, fruit salad, bbq gurame fish..
First..all drink was too sweet...we cannot drink at all...the fruit salad was the way too far from the picture, only watermelon and rockmelon and piece of mint leaf...not appetiting...the pisang mozarella was still cold inside, also the cheese bit frozen..taste ok...but really need to watch how it cooks..because its fried food..and for the last...we never get the fish..because the rice still need to cook...
The only i can mention here just the place and the service...
Food and drink...really..really need to improve...
Sorry cannot give 5star..."
