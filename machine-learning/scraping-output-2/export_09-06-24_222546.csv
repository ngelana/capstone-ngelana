There is a beachside pool for relaxing and watersports for the fun seekers. In the evening the sunset views and delicious food will round off a perfect day. If you haven't visited the quiet and serene side of Bali you are missing out.,"This is my first time to be here. Nice cozy place. Ambience was great
Food was good with ok portion.
Pool was good, infinity pool with wall climbing.
Large sun deck. .
No minimum spent, to swim, charge for kid at 10k and adult at 20k.
Great view.","Awesome place. Highly recomended place when you visit Bali. This place offer very bautifull view. The restaurant is seaside. The taste of foods and baverages is delicious, above average of the other ""Krisna"" frencise.
The price isnt too expensive. There is also have pool which increase the beauty of this place.
Best time to enjoy this place is around 4p.m to 6.30 p.m. Sunset view is awesome here. I come here at night, but this place still awesome, becaouse the sparkling lights still make my eyes comfort.","Like this place, been here more than 5x, the food is yummy, the staff are friendly too.
Cozy place for family , reunion n party.

It¬¥s clean and the stuff is super friendly. You can use the pool after pay about 5 US$.,"Had a great time here with the guarantee of a professional institution. We had insurance and during my jetski ride, the most worrying thing abroad happened... The jetski broke down, usually these are set up to threaten tourists, stress them out and force them to pay money so they don't get in trouble with the police. With Krisna it was the opposite. As soon as the jetski broke down, the crew immediately started working on it and I was worried and wanted to leave but they insisted I had 5 more minutes left and didn't want me to leave without having my fun. And that was it! No hassle whatsoever, just great service.

We also had a dolphin tour with them and it was a blast. The driver was very professional and we caught some really cool videos. I wouldn't recommend the glass boat tho as the water is already clear enough üòä

I can't stress enough how comfortable dealing with the staff is! That's the best part.

In summary, you may pay a little higher than street tour people but you get life jackets, insurance and a full guaranteed service so I absolutely recommend.","We just went for the restaurant, sitting by the pool. Prices are decent for Seririrt area but i can tell that they do everything right. The pasta was excellent and we enjoyed three pizzas too. The place seem to be very well kept too. The only suggestion i have is that the debris on the beach can use some clean up.","Went parasailing here, really awesome you can also hire jet skis enjoy the beautiful pool and enjoy some great food too and much more. Definitely family friendly but also good for large groups.","Krishna Water Sports Lovina is an excellent choice for anyone seeking an exciting and memorable water sports experience. I had the pleasure of visiting this facility and was thoroughly impressed by their level of professionalism and dedication to customer satisfaction.

The staff at Krishna Water Sports Lovina are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and experienced. They made me feel welcome and comfortable from the moment I arrived, and they were always on hand to answer any questions I had or provide guidance and assistance.

The water sports themselves were fantastic. The equipment was modern and well-maintained, and the staff ensured that safety procedures were followed at all times. I particularly enjoyed the snorkeling, which allowed me to see some of the most beautiful marine life I've ever seen.

The location of Krishna Water Sports Lovina is also a major plus. The beach is stunning, and the views of the surrounding landscape are breathtaking. The atmosphere is relaxed and peaceful, which only added to the overall enjoyment of my experience.

Overall, I would highly recommend Krishna Water Sports Lovina to anyone looking for a fun and exciting water sports adventure. The staff, equipment, and location are all top-notch, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit."

First of all, it's EXACTLY like the pictures (hard to believe, I know). Second it has to be said that the head housekeeper/house staff Putu (who really ran a team of Putu's while we were there) is amazing. She kept us fed, laundered and our plans running smoothly. Putu the gardener/security did an amazing job keeping the garden and patio clean and was there at surprisingly late/early hours to make sure we got in and out ok. Lastly, Putu the driver did a fantastic job of getting us all over the island in record time (and in a REALLY air conditioned car).

Things to know:
- the lumbung (3rd bedroom) didn't appear to be air conditioned (though it was up high so probably gets a healthy breeze), though we didn't use it, being a party of just 2, so it's possible there's a solution we didn't see/need.
- the house has filtered/purified water available in the kitchen so no need to worry about bottled water or water treatment systems, they've got you. Just refill bottles there.
- the beach is as clean as a beach can be, some mornings a green seaweed type stuff washed up but we did see people sweeping it up. What's incredible though is how calm and shallow it is, the sand so soft, as far as out as it is. I'd be totally comfortable letting kids have at with minimal supervision (and the locals clearly DO on this beach, so you'll hear kids playing almost daily). It's actually warmer than the pool too!
- we didn't have a real problem with bugs. Putu did provide a spray for the room and we may have used our own spray/cream one or two nights but in November they really weren't a huge problem.
- lastly, it's worth noting that it is clearly a practice for local salespeople to wander the beach and then stand at the gate to the compound calling out until you respond and trying to sell you things. We had budgeted our cash specifically for tours and tips so I didn't feel like I could spend a lot in this manner which caused no small amount of frustration. It might be worth budgeting extra just to smooth things over and ensure they only bother you once.","We stayed for one month in this one Villa and what an absolutely fantastic Villa. I‚Äôll start by saying the Villa is just as the pictures show. The view is unbelievable, and the rooms are very accommodating. I could go on and on about the Villa, but what makes it all work to have the experience you will truly appreciate? It‚Äôs the House Manager Putu, which means ‚ÄúFirst Born.‚Äù She is the key; her ability to make you feel as if you have been living there for years is truly special. She will ask you your plans for the next day every evening so she can manage your service from laundry to cooking three meals a day if you choose. If you have a complaint about ‚ÄúPutu,‚Äù it will say more about you than her, believe me!! Also, the house security name is Putu as well. He is equally remarkable; he will come in the evenings and leave in the mornings after breakfast. He watches over you at night by the entrance gate and cleans up the pool area in the mornings around 6 am to make sure all the leaves are out of the pool, etc... The house internet is more than adequate; the AC is also sufficient in all the rooms.

Few things to know going in:
Be comfortable with small geckos because you will see a few In the house and out. That is the nature of a tropical island. At night around 8 pm, you will see stray cats wandering on the property looking for food; Putu is very clean and will ensure nothing is left out. If you clap your hands, they will flee. Mosquitos are not a problem; however, at night, I suggest you close the house up and spray the bug spray she will provide, and that will take care of any that might have found a home from you having the Villa open all day. You may experience random blackouts, but Putu the Security will take care of it immediately. In the 30 days, we lived there, it only happened twice.

In my closing, everyone was genuinely great; the driver Juli they will recommend; however, you can still locate your own if you like. But he is excellent and honest. Moreover, he is very reasonable and will take you anywhere you want on the island. Putu has a connection for everything, from Spas to Dolphin watching, which they will come to get you from the Villa, and they are cheaper than some of the prices you would expect if you go through Kristna or Lovina locals at the beach. This is a win, win!!","Great vacation spot. The villa is exactly the same as in the pictures posted on the owner's website.  Beach clean, cleaned regularly. Staff very friendly and helpful. Meals prepared as in a very good restaurant.","Love it, Putu is the best!",
