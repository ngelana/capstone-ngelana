You can walk to 4 different waterfalls from the same path, the entrance fee is very reasonable IDR 20 000 for Red coral waterfall, you cannot swim in this waterfall. It wasn't too busy when we went. Very clean and the jungle vegetation is lovely and lush. You cannot get here if you have mobility issues.","Out of the 4 waterfalls located in this area this one was the most expensive (45k pp) and in my opinion was the least impressive (still impressive though). Though well maintained it‚Äôs a small area and you‚Äôll be in and out quite quickly. Of course the money goes to a good cause, but make sure to visit Golden Valley waterfall and others in the area if you have the chance!","A beautiful waterfall with several vantage points to enjoy the experience. One can walk across the water on rocks and be immersed in the fresh spray to cool off or sit at the side and just watch.
The guys on the gate were a fun bunch, full of smiles and laughter, so Bali. They collected the 45000 IDR fee, and takecare of the area's maintenance, which was well kept.
We walked from Munduk via a small unnamed fall towards Melanting Falls,  but failed to reach it due to the ambiguous and sometimes non existent trail markings. We came across the Spice Farm and proceeded to Labuhan Kebo Falls on a fairly easy and well defined track. Another well kept falls precinct, worth the visit.
From there we headed to Red Coral Falls on a picturesque track and  stopped at R&R Coffee Corner, for a wonderful coffee and Balinese snack.   A fellow traveller told us of this place.
Google Maps is not much use in navigation between the Labuhan Kebo Falls and Red Coral Falls, as it doesn't accept that there is a  direct route. Maps will send you on a very long detour.
Many tracks are not visible, giving rise to the idea to use a guide.
There are two routes back  to Munduk from Red Coral Falls, a left turn upon departure from the Falls will lead to a fork in the track, the left goes up to the carpark and to the Munduk trafficable road, whereas the right fork will take a fairly easy grade back to the Munduk road further down the hill near Melanting Cottages. It's a downhill roadside walk from there; take extra care in the sometimes chaotic conditions as footpaths are sketchy.","It‚Äôs a lovely waterfall where you can see along the path down to the bottom clove and coffee farms.

Entrance ticket is IDR 45,000/person.

Unfortunately that it doesn‚Äôt has a lagoon where you can have a beautiful swim.","Another easy hike

If you keep continuing walking from the first waterfall ( golden valley ), you will see this.
Tidy and clean area

If you are fit you can see 4 waterfalls but it's a long walk with lots of stairs, worth it because it's so beautiful! Munduk is a lovely area we wish we stayed longer.","Adila and her husband are some of the kindest people I met on my travels. They are keen for smiles, stories, and laughs from the second you walk in the door. Their hospitality is unbeatable. They accommodated me in ways I so much appreciated, and all without asking for a dime. Seriously, such kind hearted souls. They even carried my 30+ kg bag for me up and down stairs so that I didn't lift a finger.

I'd like to give this another stay when I return to Munduk. The views were stunning and the food is awesome! Walking right out your back door to the waterfall trails.

Ribuan Terima kasih kepada bapak dan CHEF daripada kami,  tamu  Malaysia üôè.
Room is sparkling clean.
Location is nice, easily access to 3 waterfalls by walking.
Sunset view is stunning from the restaurant area.
Breakfast is so delicious and also very filling. They will serve you a fresh blended fruit juice and a main course from the menu. Fruit juice will be sent together with a bowl of mixed tropical fruits and ended with a cup of tea or coffee. Love the combination of the breakfast to start my day.
Lunch and dinner can be ordered from the restaurant with a very reasonable price. All the foods are so so yummy especially the chicken, pork, vegetables set for dinner. Must order the pork set with Rupiah 300 000 only for 2 persons but the food portion can serve up to 4 or 5 persons.
This would be one of the memorable homestay in my life. Plan to stay here again if I visit Munduk again.","We had a realy nice time here, maybe even best stay in asia.
Realy felt at home here, no fake smiles, interactions with staff felt honest and realy welcoming.
Room was actualy clean, not just the general surfaces, but also the corners, dishes etc where clean.
Standard asian type bed, but with a realy nice soft topmatras on top so could easily have a full night sleep.
The view from the room and diner terras was amazing and never in asia did i get such a good and complete breakfast.

Also up in the mountain, you can actualy breath fresh cool air.

We were blessed with a Tokay gecko who resides above the balcony door (a note for light sleepers, the Tokay gecko's mating sounds *will* interrupt your dreams, better to try & swap rooms if you hear him at your door) & plantain squirrels who play on the banana trees below the balcony. The  room is simple, ornate in traditional Balinese styled wood & the panoramic views are priceless. The restaurant staff are lovely & of course you are greeted by more views, birdsong & the sound of the nearby waterfalls to accompany your meal. Stepping straight onto the three-waterfall trekking loop right from the homestay was an incredible bonus and you can arrange a massage to come to your bedroom upon your return. Melanting Cottages are insane value for money and absolutely worth checking out! The view & location alone are worth it.","Perfect place to slow down, recharge yourself by feasting your eyes with the mountain view, lulled by the sound of waterfall at night and the orchestra of wind, birds and rustling leaves by day. Suitable for nature lovers. I appreciate how they provide drinking water is glass bottle, not in single use plastic bottles.

The room and bathroom are spacious and clean. The design is well thought for practicality and comfort.

The hotel is also pet friendly. Plenty of garden for your pet and you to roam and play.

Two waterfalls nearby, easy level trekking. Love it!","Loved this area, so quiet and beautiful,  the people were so friendly. We hired a scooter to explore and also walked around local villages and waterfalls.  Food at Melanting Cottages was good so long as you stick to Indonesian dishes and all staff were really helpful.","Melanting cottages
We had a really wonderful time here! The view from the suite was incredible and the room spacious and cosy. The scenery is great and the location of the cottages very close to the waterfalls is so convenient for hikes. The manager is the nicest person, so thoughtful, generous and taking care of everything. He even took us to an ATM in the next village and gave our child feed for the fish there. Their restaurant is not open yet, but we got breakfast at Adila Homestay next to the cottages, which was also managed by really caring and nice people. Would also recommend the dinner there.
The paths to the bungalows are a bit slippery when wet, so be aware. And the hot water was sometimes not enough for 3 people, but after a long hike that is not a problem. All in all I hope we can return one day.","+ the VIEW
+ perfect location, right on the beautiful trail leading to the three waterfalls. You can do a nice roundtrip, getting back through the village.
+ rice fields are a little bit further, but still easily reachable on a scooter
+ comfortable parking (we had a rental car)
+ cleaning every day

Did not make use of the pool as it was too cold :) but that was not what we came for anyway.

Highly recommended! If we ever come back to Munduk, we will for sure come back again.

Big shoutout to Gus, Adi and Andre and the rest of the great staff for making our stay even more enjoyable!","A really unique experience, essentially a retreat surrounded by lush greenery. We hired a private villa with pool. The rooms were spacious and clean, (you do get bugs here and there but for a place in the outdoors like this, it's expected and nothing crazy). The beds were comfy and had netting around to protect from bugs at night.

Bathrooms had some parts of the roof that were open (essentially outdoors) but good privacy.

Breakfast and food in general was good and the service here was excellent. A special shout-out to Gus and Adi as well as the rest of the staff for being so helpful and kind, and helping to make our stay so special.

The experience here at the villa was amazing and I would definitely recommend. They even provide speakers in the room so you can listen to music whilst relaxing at the pool!","Really enjoyed our stay at Villa Bintang. Had our own villa with open air bathroom and private pool with direct views to the jungle - all in lush shades of green. Restaurant less exciting but staff very kind and helpful.

He woke up and drove over in the middle of the night to check me in, give me water, and sort me in a gorgeous room with a charging adapter. Seriously, this place is underrated for what it is. It was an unbeatable value for a gorgeous view, HUGE room, and services available like moto rental, massage, breakfast, etc. There is no air con but the rooms are perfectly tucked into daylong shade so they stay cool. I had no issues without it and I usually seek it out. It's also situated within walking to trails that lead to the waterfalls, rice fields, and Munduk town area.

Oh and also the WiFi was impeccable. I worked at all hours of the night and had no connectivity issues from my room or main areas.

I also had a lovely massage booked through the hotel - her name was KADEK Budiriana. A little odd to take place at the hotel in a single bed but.. she was lovely and super thorough so no complaints. Thanks again and I'd definitely stay here if I come back!"

Served a chicken dish which was  previously frozen. I was overcharged the stated 20% for tax service fee. What service was there? Just bring food to the table!

We came across this warung while visiting the waterfalls. We stopped because we were travelling with children and they were hungry. When the food came it was simply amazing. It was one of the best meals we had in Bali (and we had been there for over a month). Everything cooked and presented with care. We had satay, a grilled chicken with a delicious sauce and some sort of satay on lemon grass that we had not come across before (I have forgotten the name, sorry!). If you are in the area, do not hesitate to have lunch there!!","We had excellent Mie Goreng.
It was perfect after a long hike in the hot weather.","This was an absolutely phenomenal find and a hole-in-the-wall. While hiking from one waterfall to another, it started to rain, so we took shelter in this warung, and decided to eat. Flavor was fantastic, and right up there with my favorite Indonesian food during my trip to Bali. Dishes were home-made and the staff were nice enough to even welcome me into the kitchen to see how the food was made. Great flavor and good portion sizes. Food is very cheap as well; I just tipped them a little extra given how great value it was. Initially I had reservations about whether it was safe to eat given that it was a random Warung on a hiking trail, but I can report to anyone reading this that I did not get sick and was so happy I ate here :)","A must stop while you are hiking along for the waterfalls. The food is excellent, well seasoned, home made and reasonably priced. Try the spring rolls along with your main dish, some of the best I've ever had!","Super recommendü§© we were visiting the waterfalls around and we stopped there for lunch. The owner is simply amazing, she cooked for us the best Mie Goreng I‚Äôve ever had in the entire island!! We were curious about the clove process and she spent time explaining and teaching us everything and answering all our questions.. really really amazing ü•∞"
