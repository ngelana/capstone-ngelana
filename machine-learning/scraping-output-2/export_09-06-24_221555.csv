Entering the room, we had this special Wow-effect - spacious, nicely furnished, clean and well maintained. The half open air bathroom with shower and bathhub under green leaves is breath taking nice.

The whole areal is like a spacious green park, you do not notice other guests. There is also a clean pool and benches to relax.

We got coconuts offered free of charge. A water dispenser is available. On request, I could enjoy professional massages for IDR  150k per hour. Also the owners are very friendly, supprttive and showing a great hospitality.

We really enjoyed the time here.","Small hotel with just a few loka‚Äôs, a nice pool and a beautiful garden in the calm town of Tejakula. Food and shops on walking distance just as a stone beach and les waterfall.
Very authentic part of Bali and my personal favorite.
Daily yoga is here available on demand, they offer massage in a secret garden spot on the property and all you wish for in terms of food and supplies is in reach of 1 km.
It‚Äôs not for no reason I decided to make this my Bali home üòä
Snorkelling/diving mecca of Tulamben in reach with a nice 40 minutes scooter ride along the coast.
The family who owns and takes care of this place are simply the sweetest and caring people I‚Äôve met in Bali.
Thank you Rivan and the rest of the family for taking care of me and making this trip so special üß°üôèüèª","We loved our stay at Pranaja Loka!
We travelled with our 2.5-year-old son and he was very happy with the accommodation. We love the beautifully landscaped gardens, the small houses with their minimalist designs, the open bathrooms, the comfortable beds and our favourite were the pool. The water was fresh and there was a fairly wide edge of the pool where our toddler was happy to play there. J, the owner, was very responsive. Thank you!
Gonna be back someday :)",The location and garden design are just perfect . All rooms are small but nice . No staff on arrival was strange. The owner was even stranger . Not so typical yoga spiritual personality.  All in all it was good üëç 5* all the way . Wifi slow for video uploads . Free parking .,"We stayed here for two weeks sharing Loka 1 with another couple.  Everything was fabulous, we will definitely come back to Tejakula and stay here again.  Jay, the owner, was very helpful, gave us options for things to see and places to eat.  The Warung SMA is a short walk and has great food and drinks."

Very friendly, good service and guides. We recommend everyone to hire Nyoman as driver/guide and if you like the authentic Bali you must stay at their accommodation.

Thanks all! Forever in our hearts.","The house is a peaceful place to recharge energy. The owner (""Klausi"" ;-) ) supports where he can, offers cooking with Mama, provides breakfast, offers tours or buys anything you want for you. Klausi has a lot of years of experience in the tourist business and is a professional tour guide. He has a sense of humor but also supports you with anything you might want to learn or know about Bali. The beach is only a couple of 10s of meters from the house and the house is provided with a lovely swimming pool.
In short, this is the perfect place to spend your holidays.","Nyoman is amazing host of this place: full of kindness, hospitality and  service. Homestay is very cameral, quite but full of conveniences. Surrounded with big, beautiful garden. Rooms are pretty spacious with AC and bathroom.Very clean. There is very good wifi transfer if you need to connect.  Big kitchen with refrigerator and stove if you want to cook something. You can also order massage or spend your time relaxing at  the blue swimming pool with crystal water. I highly reccomend this place when you are in Tejakula.","To find Nyoman and his family is the best what happened to me! The guest house is so comfy and beautiful, everything is made with love and soul! Wonderful garden, 1000% trust in Nyomans suggestions concerning Tours over Bali, concerning money change and whatsoever. Besides that, Nyoman is a very good cook...just eat and be happy! I have found a friend and I will return as soon as possible!",Nyoman and Tessa are such nice persons ! They do all so you feel like at home. Anything we needed they are available! They prepared delicious breakfast and meals for us as this big fresh Tuna from the market!The rooms are very confortable and clean and the garden and the swimming pool were so great :) We will definitely come back to see you in Tejakula if we go back to Bali ;) Thank you Nyoman and take care!

We stopped at this Warung and were greeted with our beautiful hosts.

The menu is as descibed, and the food was delivered quickly and was very tasty.

We had crackers while we waited for mains, with an ice cold beer.

I had the grilled chicken with a side of rice and egg. The chicken was well cooked,  tender, and full of flavour.  Served with a side of Balinese sambal.

My wife had vegetarian nasi goreng with tofu and extra greens.

Great little restaurant and would highly recommend.

terima kasih!","Loved our dinner at this new warung in the area. The food was excellent! Grilled chicken and fish were both expertly prepared and had a lot of flavor. Also, delicious sambal and nasi goreng. Lovely atmosphere and amazing service from the staff and owner.
