It‚Äôs an incredible hotel, beautiful‚Ä¶ but the high light is the people who are working there! Always making you feel so welcomed and loved. I have to address a special thank to Windy and Risky, for making our stay at Kayon Jungle even better! ‚ù§Ô∏è","We had visited this resort for our honeymoon. The property is fabulous and is a great place for couples who want to enjoy the privacy. Everything from the view of the property to the rooms were excellent. The hospitality of the staff was the best hospitality I‚Äôve seen till date. Even for a vegetarian person like me, the restaurant had plenty of options. They surprised us with a bottle of wine and a cute cake for our new beginning. I strongly recommend to all who want to enjoy the time with their loved ones with such privacy and good views and good rooms.","Stayed here for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon. We had let the hotel know in advance it was our honeymoon and so they arranged a nice decoration in our room. The location of the hotel is stunning - overlooking the jungle. The rooms were perfectly clean and we didn‚Äôt have any issues with bugs/mosquitos. We booked  private dinner in advance which was a lovely experience.
The only criticism I would have is the pool does get very busy and full of people taking photos all day which does ruin the atmosphere a bit. Also the food at the poolside was a bit disappointing.
We enjoyed the breakfast that we had but sometimes found our evening meals were a bit hit and miss - especially when they had a bbq buffet.
Overall these are only minor criticisms and we would still recommend the hotel for its unique setting.","This jungle resort is just excellent. I visited in May 2024 for my birthday with my husband and it exceeded our expectations. We are swamped travelers so not easily impressed but the service was superb. We stayed in the Royal suite and Dewa was our butler and assisted by Kris and Risky, all are well trained and professional. We will be back.","Outstanding hotel. One of the best I‚Äôve ever been to and I‚Äôve standing at outstanding places before.  The hotel is beautiful with amazing cascading pools. Our villa was outstanding large with a pool and jacuzzi and views that were breathtaking. Our butlers, Dewa and Risky were outstanding. They arranged everything for us and ensured we had a stress free stay at the resort   I give this hotel my highest possible recommendation for luxury travelers"

They have silver package (500k per person) for one day pass include towel, locker, free welcome drink and 300k credit for food and drinks

The view is stunning. They have 3 floors, you can visit every pool in every floor. The below pools are bigger than the main one at the lobby floor.

Food, unexpectedly tasty üò≥ Pizza, pasta and chips 10/10

Merik, the staff that took care of us, were pretty good at her job. We really appreciate her service üòä","Great place to grab some drinks, have some food and enjoy the sun and the pools.

Food was good, drinks were too. Vibes were great. The only thing I will say is to triple-check whats included and whats not included, because they ended up charging us for some drinks they had told us would be included but their language barrier is so bad too.","Such a magical place.
The staff is 10/10
The design and architecture are stunning.
The view : wow.
Nice Dj set, chill crowd, 3 levels of pools
I totally recommend.
ü´∂‚ú®","From the moment I stepped into Wanna Jungle Pool & Bar, nestled within the Kayon Jungle Resort, I knew I had discovered something truly special. The club‚Äôs design, inspired by the breathtaking curves of Bali‚Äôs Tegalalang Rice Terrace, offers a serene escape over three distinct levels of infinity pools. Each pool, with its refreshing water and ample deck space, invites you to a state of relaxation and sun-soaking pleasure like no other.

The real standout feature for me was the unique collection of shaded cabanas and the circular seating pod. These exclusive spots provide not just comfort but an ambiance that captures the essence of luxury relaxation in a lush river valley setting. It‚Äôs a day club that brilliantly blends exclusivity with the natural beauty of Bali, creating an unmatched atmosphere.

Choosing the gold package deal was a decision I won‚Äôt regret. It came with access to a private cabana and 130 AUD worth of credits to spend, elevating the experience to a whole new level of enjoyment and relaxation. This, combined with the stellar service and the quality of refreshments and snacks available, made every moment spent at Wanna Jungle feel like a slice of paradise.

In comparison to other crowded spots in Bali, Wanna Jungle Pool & Bar stands out for its tranquility, stunning views, and the sheer luxury of space and privacy. It was the perfect day escape, offering a blissful retreat from the usual hustle and bustle of tourist-packed places.

My advice to anyone visiting Bali is to make a stop at Wanna Jungle Pool & Bar a top priority. Whether you‚Äôre looking to unwind in a cabana with a good book, enjoy the sun from the infinity pools, or simply take in the stunning views with a cocktail in hand, this place has it all. It‚Äôs not just a day club; it‚Äôs an experience that captures the heart of Bali‚Äôs enchanting beauty and the essence of what a true day club should be.

In conclusion, Wanna Jungle Pool & Bar is an exceptional find in Bali, offering an unparalleled day club experience in the heart of nature. It‚Äôs a must-visit for anyone looking to indulge in luxury, serenity, and the natural beauty of this incredible island.","Perfect place! Great service and yummy food! We have upgraded for their gold access which includes the access to the top floor but also bottle of wine. In the day when we were visiting it wasn‚Äôt great weather and the water temperature felt little too cold, however on each floor there is also warm section. If you get the gold pass you have also access to the whirlpool!"

Payangan, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80572, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=3117987108659678310,OPERATIONAL,+62 813-5306-5420,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.4,122,,"Overall, the experience was great. I'll share my list of Pros and Cons.

Pros:
- FREE breakfast and dinner everyday
- Activity packages that the villa offers were around 150k IDR CHEAPER than activities you find online.
- I recommend getting the best luxury tier room as the jacuzzi require very little to no maintenance (as in using a net to remove bugs or tiny leaves from trees). The jacuzzi is located above your room. I stayed in the lower luxury tier which I regret. The highest tier has the net that you can lay down on and have a way better view of the forest surrounding the villa.
- It is only 10/15mins away from all tourst attractions. Same with Cretya Ubud and Sunset.
- They have massage services at the villa, you just need to give at least 30mins heads up. This is additional charge. The price is cheap too. Average 150k IDR for 60mins. The massage was great!
- One of the staff offered me free scooter rides back and forth to Cretya Ubud Pool Club. He was very friendly with me and took take of whatever I needed.

Cons:
- The entrance to the LOCATION was suspicious as hell. A pile of garbage near the parking area (they burn their garbages). So you can't smell it from the entrance, but it's definitely not pleasing to see.
- There are a bit of bugs around outside your room, you might encounter a small one in your room, but I didn't. At night, I had frogs and some other animals that I couldn't tell that were making noises around your room at night. It's not loud enough to bother you, unless you're a very light sleeper.
- It is not 24/7 service. They do have an whatsapp group that they add you in incase you need anything from them. The group chat is with you and all the staff members. I believe the latest service you can make requests of is around 9/10pm. Then they start back their service again at 7am around.

Conclusion:
Main concern is just the entrance road to the villa. I believe they can work on that to make it more visually appealing, but it won't ruin your experience. If I stay in Ubud again, I will definitely consider coming back to Woy Woy Escape Bresela.","Nice views and is away from the main Ubud area. We stayed in a room jacuzzi at the top. The room, facilities and toilet are fairly clean. Needs a lick of paint and some maintenance but since we got it at a good price which included breakfast and dinner couldn't mark it down.

Food was average but was included at a very good price per night. We ordered some food one day and delivery was quick as not too far from the main Ubud Centre.

The staff was very friendly and sorted us out with transport to Sideman where our next hotel was.","Went there for honeymoon trip, road isn't good car definitely struggle to get in and need a bit of motorcycle's skill. Staff have amazing service they serve breakfast and dinner as well. But the jacuzzi took so long to heat up and sometimes it turned off by itself waited for 3 hours and finally is heated up but when we turned on the bubble black particles came out, and we decided not to use it. View is so amazing from the room and a lot of ants in the room and your belongings just full of ants. and last thing room isn't that clean, daybed is dirty. Need to improve the facilities for that price.","It's such a nice place within a rural area. Not to far from ubud, but the access from main road is so narrow and steep for bike and car.
They provide dinner and breakfast with a few menu. The jacuzzi also took few hours to get warm.

Overall :
Place : 4/5
Surrounding : 5/5
Staff : 5/5
Clean : 5/5
Worth the price : 3/5",You will not regret your stay there!!! It is located inside the jungle!!! The rooms are so well decorated and the private jacuzzi is outstanding!!! There is also a projector for romantic movies!!! The manager will help you to rent a scooter and with transportation!!!

A bit higher in price but it was so worth it.","One of the best restaurants in Ubud that serve food from multiple countries, from local food, korean food, japanese food and western food.
I ate the fried bebek (fried duck) while enjoying the traditional dance in from of the table. The taste of the duck is good even though the bones are not as crispy as from the other local restaurants. (It is not a typo error, it is really the bone).","I was satisfied with most food and services. But I never recommend the pork plate I ordered. (forget name) The pork was too hard to chew, and I only ate half a piece and my jaw hurt.
I loved the salmon steak though. Garnish was perfect!","Very great location for breakfast and lunch. Dinner also when not in rainy season.

Park space? Quite limited and join with hotel guests.
Food? Great as they mainly serves western and Indonesian food. Preferred western food options.
Ambience? Another level and you need to check it out by yourself.

Recommended? Definitely.","I visited Kepitu Restaurant to celebrate my birthday, the service, food and atmosphere was great. A special thanks to our host Ari who was absolutely brilliant, she helped to accommodate my gluten free dietary requirements and provided a complimentary gluten free birthday treat! Thank you for making it an extra special birthday celebration, see you again!"

He told me I don't need certain amount of time to meditate. The concept of time doesn't matter.

It's really fascinating how much breathing could do especially when we are nervous or tired.
