They are very friendly and offer a complimentary tester set of 13 different coffee and tea variation. They sell their products only in their shop and its more affordable and authentic than other places. P.S they don't charge any extra tax or service fee,"they‚Äôll give you a short tour at the beginning, then you‚Äôll get to try some of their products! it‚Äôs the same rodeo you‚Äôll get at any other of these establishments, but the view here makes this one stand out! definitely a must do when you‚Äôre in bali!

a note on the products you can buy form the gift shop: they don‚Äôt have any added sugar, so you‚Äôll definitely have to add in a lot of sugar when your making it yourself!","If you love coffee, you will definitely need to stop here if you are heading through the area. You get a complementary tasting tray on arrival, which almost fills you up enough not to need a coffee at the end, but who does that üòÜ.

The coffee and tea are amazing! The staff are knowledgeable and super friendly, and there is a great tour for the process of coffee making! Make sure to do the tour, enjoy the coffee and grab yourself a bag of your favourite tea or coffee on the way out, but there is no obligation to do so. Just enjoy the tour!","Edit: while the tour, garden and coffee tasting were great. The coffee and tea we bought turned out to be white powders and you need multiple teaspoons (6 in the coffee and it‚Äôs still bland) for flavour. Don‚Äôt recommend purchasing. I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs in them because there is no ingredients list. At 150k each they are a huge rip off.

Had lunch next door, then popped over to try some coffee. Staff are very friendly and took us on a garden tour, pointing out all the fruits and herbs that they mix with their coffee and explaining how they harvest and roast the coffee beans.
They provide a complimentary coffee tasting platter. We bought a bag of coffee and tea after trying them for a total of 320k.","It is an excellent place to understand more about local coffee, civet coffee and all the spices used in tea/ coffee. The staff ( Our guide was Ms. Risa who was very helpful ), are kind enough to provide testers of all the different varieties of coffee/ tea. And they take you on a tour around their property. Also has a swing for a photo op. They also have a lot of collections of fresh coffee/ tea/ perfume and other items for purchase.  A very good must visit detour on the way back from Ulun danu Beratan."
ChIJd99LpEwn0i0Rp57cL6TC-w8,Pure Luwak Coffee Bali,-8.345128599999999,115.187692,"M53Q+W3W, Baturiti, Tabanan Regency, Bali 82191, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=1151728140156706471,OPERATIONAL,+62 877-6009-0683,coffee_shop,"coffee_shop, cafe, food, store",4.3,204,,"‚ö†Ô∏èCAUTION ANIMALS IN CAPTIVITY
This is a completely tourist trap with animal abuse. They place strategically the luwak in a ‚Äúfriendly cage‚Äù without bars, telling you that they live in the wild, which its a total lie. And when the clients leave they they put it back in a cage.  NOT RECOMMENDED IF YOU ARE A FREE LOVER ANIMALS. If you see the video the animal its fully stressed and he don‚Äôt know how to jump down (something strange if they live in the wild). DON‚ÄôT GO THERE","Thanks to our guide, who made this excursion unique.
For 100k you will try luwak coffee and see full production, would see all spices (almost all :D), which possibly produced in Bali in real life (starting from growing cardamon and ending up with Vanilla and cacao plants).
+ swing for nice photos and free cacao tasting (if you will be as lucky as us üëã)","A very beautiful place, where you can learn how they make the authentic Luwak coffee. They offer you for free to taste a variety of teas and coffee, mixed with spices. Everything is incredible, one if the best teas is Lemongrass tea, the flavour is awesome. The visit worths It.","Was a good experience to try various kinds of coffee and tea. The lady explained well about Luwak coffee and how they make coffee.

However there were too many mosquitoes which was very annoying to taste tea and enjoy time there.",We had a lot of fun here and the staff was great. We tried a bunch of different coffees and teas free and talked about the process of Luwak coffee (yuck). Despite being a setup tourist place there was not the typical high pressure sales. We did buy some coffee and tea but it was pricey. But hey once in a lifetime
