From the moment I stepped in, I felt welcomed and enveloped in an atmosphere of warmth. Each dish has been a culinary masterpiece, perfectly complemented by the cozy surroundings. It's clear to me now why your establishment is regarded as simply the best in the area.","the general atmosphere is great, the Italian music goes perfectly with the place located by the sea...
As far as the service is concerned, nothing to complain about. the food surprised me, good products as well as good cooking. the lasagna is delicious as well as the pizza. On the other hand, the gnocchi was undercooked but had an incredible taste.","The mushroom pizza was good but I think it was overpriced. Same with all the food here. The fish and chips were a bit strange as they had little pieces fried in batter, mostly batter, for the price very little, I would not repeat. Everything on the menus for me was overpriced for Bali. Even a Coca-Cola was at least 50% dearer than elsewhere and you only got a tiny 250ml can. I suppose they hope you will buy another. Instead I will go elsewhere next time. Although the views over the estuary were pleasant.","Stopped for a bite to eat at this little Italian restaurant very close to Ceningan Island.

In the evening time, the view across to the Island was absolutely amazing, the bar itself was really nice very well decorated with a small pool inside the restaurant if you fancy chilling out with your feet in the water or just relaxing in the little pool overlooking the small estuary that comes in from the sea is an absolute delight to sit and have a meal here on the side of the water.

Of course the main dishes are all Italian, but there are some of the speciality dishes are available in the restaurant menu.

I tried the lasagna. Be careful if you don’t have a big stomach. This dish is absolutely huge. It was like a lasagne volcano.

The drinks menu is very expensive very nice a lot of nice cool fruit juices. I had a lime water lime sparkling water which was very tasty very fresh. .

The overall dining experience was very nice with the view with the common surroundings obviously the restaurant got very busy as it is very well situated and it seems a lot of people visit the restaurant in the evening. It was full capacity.

The staff were very nice, very welcoming very friendly. The service was very fast as usual in Bali everything to do with service is amazing.","One of the best authentic Italian Restaurant so far ini Bali, and one and only in Nusa Lembongan. I am happy of course of the great foods, but also outstanding service, the staffs are so helpful and professional and also the place have extra wonderful view, to the sea. Very good vibes, and make a good mood. Totally recommended and of course I will come back!"

We tried the beef rendang with jackfruit curry and the chili chicken. Antoq was super friendly, and he seemed very happy we were there (other tourists were there already), but it made us feel very happy there as well!
Thank you, Antoq and Eka! See you soon!","I take the photo after I eat some of them because we are so hungry, craving spicy and santan foods. As a native Minang, I can say the taste is still original, does not try to adapt to local or tourist tongues.

Overall the food are great, the place only need some cleaning up, especially the toilet. Tarimo kasih banyak uda antoq.","Easily the best Padang food on the island. The warm fuzzy feeling of having good comfort food and great homey hospitality is hard to beat.

PROS

- only 9 rooms which makes it quiet
- good internet
- friendly staff
- you can hire scooters from the location
- restaurant at the location
- AC works great
- comfy bed
- room service every day
- mini fridge

CONS

- road to the cottage is rough and a bit hard to access
- too much light comes in from the bathroom door
- breakfast can be better (toast wasn’t the best and it’s hard to mess a toast up)","The airbnb host accepted my trip with only having a room available for half my trip. I ask them to cancel my booking which they said was not possible and I would still have to pay for half my trip.

Had to contact Airbnb to fix this, the host did not want to help.",Our one night stay here was absolutely delightful. Stunning view. Rooms are lovely and clean with great air con. The staff were also incredibly helpful and good with kids. We decided to extend our stay but there was no availability at this hotel so the owner drove us to our new hotel at no extra cost.

The area where it is located is calm and well accessible. The staff is really nice and helpful. There is a lot of variety for breakfast which is really good. They also help you to rent a motorbike.

BUSY BUSTLING FLIES - THREE STARS TO ALL - READ CAREFULLY

We made it our quest to find a bite to eat as makan siang (lunch). Reached after a little trip taking the rickety path uphill.

Our approach to a seemingly quiet atmosphere - no one about, the kind lady sprung to life as our engine growled. Turns out she was the only one working, kitchen to serving, as Pak Putu was off the island.

We ordered the Nasi Campur, Sate Ayam, Edamame, Nasi Goreng and Chicken Spring Rolls. With the kind lady working independently, we awaited our food patiently one at a time. Can’t blame her for the island-time service.
Food wasn’t anything to write home about but enough to tie us over. We politely declined the dogs who came for their share of the meal though their presence added plenty to the atmosphere.

Wouldn’t be in a rush to come back here nor recommend to first timers to Lembongan but menu offers something local for ever one and to that I write this review.

Transport back was easy to organize with the friendly young man who chipped in to the kitchen later on as well.

It must be a unique circumstance as the main man was away so take this however you wish. Regardless it’s a decent place off the beaten track to taste should you want a break from the higher and polished restaurants.","Absolutely lovely!! The food was one of the best of all we had in Bali. :) The relocation surprised us a little, but also it was very convenient as we were staying nearby. :D The service was amazing! The food amazing! Definitely worth a visit!","Most genuine and friendly locals we have met on the island so far. Great portion size relative to other gaffs we've hit up. Red curry was delish. Chill vibe, good chats, just like catching up with an old mate","It’s a bit off the beaten path but if you have time to stay and relax, you will be well-rewarded with the world’s most adorable dog and lovingly, meticulously prepared meals that will leave you wanting to come back. One of the best vegan meals we had.",Eating at Warung Putu was amazing!! Love the vibe and the owners and staff were really friendly. The food was delicious (stellar coconut curry) with a great welcoming atmosphere. Inside of the restaurant was also super clean.

Apart from views from the hostel.
The place has card access to the locker, my money was stolen. There was only one more guest during my stay, she saw the whole thing escalate as well.
The spare card was used to steal from my locker. Camera not working, convinently. The young staff katut was nowhere in the hostel next day when questioned.

The chicken burrito (yes, for breakfast) was super tasteful. They cook everything in the moment, including the tortilla and the vegetables are SUPER fresh. By far the best avocado, or a I should say guacamole I tried in South East Asia in the past 6 months.
Special mention to the Ice Latte - Finally a coffee that keeps its strength.

It’s outside the tourist roads, but it’s worth the 2 minute detour.

P.S.: Bob Marley, UB40 and other reggae legends as ambient music…","Our last night on Lembongan and decided to try this restaurant.

They also offer pick up and drop off service","This place was such a pleasant surprise. We arrived in this little village looking for just coffee and found Mexican food with it. The coffee was excellent and the service was impeccable. The food was so fresh and tasty. Everything is made to order - so it took longer but it is so worth the wait.

After we were unfortunately ripped off at our original stay in the area and there was no more room here, we ended up at Stardust.

There, manager Kay really cared about us, which was super.
Together with her staff, she made our honeymoon on Nusa Lembongan at Stardust unforgettable.

The rooms are super, nice and spacious and very clean. The staff are super friendly and offer you a nice water against thirst.

The view from the reception by the pool is breathtaking! Really beautiful, you look all the way to Yellow bridge.

Kay is very sweet and thinks along with you. We got super nice tips for excursions and tasty lunch/dinner spots. Kay also brought us to the harbor on the day off!

Note, there are not the most food options right in the area other than an Italian place down the hill and a seafood place we were not brave enough to try given how few people seemed to frequent it (although we were told it was not quite peak tourist season).

The owners are so friendly and helpful, we were able to rent a moped from them for a very reasonable price. The room was very big and very nice and breakfast was included. Would definately recommend!","The room is a little scarcely furnished but we could manage well. The owner was very friendly. We could rent a motorbike with two helmets. They also offered to bring us to the harbor for our departure. From our room we could see Nusa Ceningan, some nice waves etc. I would come back here if I sat foot on that island again.","First we were kinda lost in this big room, one double bed with just a little bit of furniture. There are those kinda holes in the wall to keep the airflow going, but no mosquitoe-net. The doors are not 100% closed.
The shower is ether cold or super hot, nothing in between. It’s pretty simple, it seems they using rainwater. Later it turned out the room is just lovely, we felt home within 2 days. There were some small animals coming in, nothing disturbing, it was almost like we lived aside with them. No mosquitoes. No noice, no loud neighbors, just a lovely place to relax the brain. So we did.

The family is really sweet, always there to help out. Motorbike, shuttle bus, simple breakfast, nothing missing.
Overall simple as hell, for the price easily a 5/5! If you’re looking for luxury it’s the wrong place.","The pool in the middle is very nice. On the day it's low tide, so you can't really go to the beach at this place. The rooms are big, but not cozy and not finished well. The host and staff are really friendly!","Beautiful family, beautiful pool with a beautiful view. Can’t beat the location. Lovely breakfast provided in the morning. We enjoyed our stay in true lembongan."

The rooms are nice though the bathrooms lack atmosphere. They could significantly be improved with some renovation and accessories. Great location of the Hotel and the views of the seaweed farms in the morning were stunning. They are currently building new rooms which when finished look promising to be some of the best on the island. Staff is super helpful with giving tips, organizing a scooter and a boat back to Bali or to the Gilis.","I was really excited to book a room at this villa when i saw photos from my computer screen in Ubud. The owner was extremely kind to organise my transportation and so i had high hopes to come here.
Unfortunately when i arrived i was really disappointed with what i saw.
The rooms are quite old and outdated. I stayed in my room for about 2hrs until i decided to move somewhere else.
The room had a funny old smell, it was quite dark, the ac had been turned on when i got there and yet it was still warm.
Although the staff there was really kind to offer me lots of assistance while staying there, i simply could not.
The photos i saw online did not match what i saw in person. It was kind of odd that they advertised a room that is in the process of getting built which is the reason i fell for this place.
Perhaps i will give this place another chance once its renovated and cleaned up more.
Although its in the past now, i felt really bad to “waste” their time? I decided to pay for the night i was meant to stay 450k which tbh, i regret now because it wasnt really my fault i fell for the photos online 🤦🏾‍♀️","We rested our minds, body and soul here the past three days. This is a lovely spot right in front of the ocean. The owner also owns the restaurant across the road, can organise transport, boat tours and scooter hire.  Wry very accommodating and friendly.",Located in strategic location and straightly facing the lagoon. We also able to see the yellow bridge. The view was stunning. Bird chirping in the morning. They give free refill of water so you just bring your tumbler and refill and not using too many plastic bottle water. The room was compy and they give sweet set up using flower. The breakfast was good and view facing to lagoon.,"Nice rooms and pool area, nice beach bar for breakfast (included) and other meals. very friendly and helpful staff (they offered themselves to take us by scooter to boat Harbour). Downside, a little smelly on the shower area and not so much hot water."

Will definitely be back! 🙌,"Amazing staff, he was always there to help. The huts are located on one of the main roads so that makes it very easy to get around the island. Room and the facilities are very good considering the rate you are paying for. Rooms are spacious and you’ll get a view of the sea weed farms",The staff is so friendly and lovely people. It breaks my heart to say this because of how nice the people are but our room was infested with rats. It was the worst night of our life. Me and my partner were disgusted as we couldn’t sleep because of how loud the rats were squeaking. We literally saw two rats running around in our room. They were very helpful to move us to another villa at 2am in the morning and give us a full refund. It’s unfortunate that such a negative experience overshadow the kindness of the staff.,"2 night stay at Pula Huts with a group of 9, the rooms are nice and the guests very friendly and helpful. Some bars and restaurants in the neighborhood, and the view is amazing.","Clean room,
Cheap price,
Staff welcome,
Beautiful view"

Definitely MUST SEE place for all art lovers. Rai guided us through the gallery and explained us the motives, techniques, plans.. You can buy great t-shirts and paintings for affordable prices. T-shirts are available opposite the Mama Mia restaurant.","We stayed at Lembah Bhucharya Huts, next to the gallery of Rai's Art Space, and learnt that the artist Rai is the brother of our host, Guru (and the old gentleman in one photo is their grandfather aged 110 years!) But what an interesting character is Rai. He is an intriguing and unconventional artist and it reflects in his home and work space/gallery. Rai was busy painting when we popped in but welcomed us as old friends. Some construction is being done on his property and when completed, this premises will offer a stellar contribution to the diverse cultural richness of this small but beautiful island. It is a must see!","Terima kasih Rai for sharing your space, your inspirations, your stories & even your beer! We were privileged to have a personal gallery tour from Rai after meeting him at his shop on the waterfront. He is so talented & so kind. We left with beautiful art. See you again one day 🙏🏽",Met Rai and he explained his inspiration and told us his story. A fantastic building holding some unique and interesting art from an inspiring and interesting artist. Totally worth a visit. They also have a bar for drinks on site.,Great art and space. Lovely people!

Although it’s not near the main strip in Nusa Lembongan, we thought it was a good location to explore from and you can easily walk across the yellow bridge to a bunch of bars and restaurants with sunset views on Nusa Ceningan. We also walked up towards Dream Beach and did the gorgeous cliff walk, seeing Devil’s tears and ending at Sandy Bay. We don’t drive scooters but if you are able to, it will definitely help you get around. If not, there are taxi trucks that will take you places. One small critique of the villa is that the inside had quite a mothball smell but other than that, we loved our time here!","Beautiful villa, right on the beach! Views across to Nusa Cenigan from the deck and the pool 🌴🌴🌴
Thank you Gede!!

Negative points only regarding the sink, which is outside the room, and the water pressure and temperature which were pretty unstable. The location also requires a scooter, which we were going to rent anyways. Good quality for price.","Great value for money, clean room and friendly folks running the place.
