From the warm welcome upon arrival to the impeccable service throughout our stay, every moment was a delight. The lush surroundings and picturesque views provided the perfect backdrop for relaxation and rejuvenation. The rooms were spacious, clean, and elegantly decorated, ensuring a comfortable stay. The on-site amenities, including the stunning pool and delicious dining options, further enhanced our experience. We left feeling completely refreshed and already planning our return. Highly recommend to anyone seeking a memorable stay in Ubud!

The massage offered at the hotel’s spa was a highlight of our stay, providing a blissful experience that left us feeling pampered and renewed","I don't even have proper words to express how perfect this place was for me. I was looking for a place where I could feel Nature around me for inspiration and writing. The pool villa exceeded my expectations. The beauty made me speechless. It was magical. I had friendly squirrels coming to visit every day, and all kinds of butterflies, birds and all.
The staff was so friendly and took very well care of me. The food of the restaurant is delicious! I was impressed with the afternoon tea I had every day in my villa. I also had a great free yoga class in the morning. I felt so loved during my stay. I hope I can go back. Thank you Ubud Valley.","I stayed two days for my honey moon.
The welcoming was excellent.
The room was clean and neat. We ask them to prepare for honey moon night and all preparations were above the expectations.
The complementary products were from the top brands.
For the food, you can have it serve to your room or you can take it in the restaurant.
The reception and service were great and they always come with a smile.
I would come again when I visit Bali next time.","It was an amazing experience! The ambience and decor are enchanting and everything was very clean!! The feeling of being deep in the tropical forest with a typical frog croaking, rain drops and sun shining through the forest is a perfect place of soaking in nature's beauty.
All food was delicious and nutritious, the fruits were amazing and the mango pudding was heaven!!
The staff are super friendly and accommodating , the massage experience was so relaxing!!
Over all ,an out of the world experience , just like we wanted in  our own private villa with kids and private pool. We  all really enjoyed every aspect of this resort!!
All villas have pools, but not all are infinity pools. if you want particularly infinity pool you might request them. I suggest the hotel to add on some ceiling fans in the deck area as it sometimes can be hot and humid .It is fine when it is windy and cool.","Amazing forest backdrop.
The gardens are tropical and kept in immaculate condition.
Our villa was spacious and clean with a private infinity pool.
It was beautiful waking up to the sunrise every morning.
It is a peaceful and serene location.
The breakfast and afternoon teas were superb.
We enjoyed all our meals and activities such as yoga, village walk and Balinese BBQ.
What truly makes this resort special is the staff from the front desk, wait staff , cleaners, gardeners, drivers and spa team.  Every staff member we encountered could not do enough for us.  Always a beautiful Balinese smile on their faces. So polite, gentle and warm.  We will leave with warm hearts and wonderful memories and look forward to coming back soon."

Beautifully designed villas in luscious green gardens. Making it private and serene. Only a few villas making the place never seem busy. The staff are always available to help and are so friendly. They offer massages and their food at their restaurant is freshly made and is delicious! Extremely family friendly with a lovely play area at the restaurant. The villas are large and have 2 bedrooms with a dining area and kitchen. Highly recommend if you're looking for an amazing holiday stay in Ubud!,"Probably, a good place for a short term escape vacation.

I wouldn’t recommend it for active tourists - pretty far from Ubud and any interesting places.

And definitely it’s a wrong place for mid and long term.
We rented a villa for five months and then were asked to leave. The villa was booked without asking us.

The price policy is non-transparent, you can be asked to pay more at one random month, and you can be kicked off once.

Some staff is very arrogant, like Vivian, who left 5stars review here.

Update: There’s a wrong order in your reply. I applied for prolonging while I was staying in the place. And my traveling was not the reason, the villa was already booked. In opposite, my decision to travel was based on 50% price increase for summer months, that was announced in May.
And you know what I meant when say arrogant, please do not mislead.","I have been to this lovely place and I can definitely recommend it. Who wants a wonderful and fairytale vacation, it is the best choice. The place is magical and spectacular, the staff is pleasant. The cook cooks delicious meals. Everyone liked the meals that were incredibly beautiful and tasty. Honestly, I wanted to take it to the Czech Republic :-D I could not miss full body massages, the massager was awesome, kind and caring. I would let myself be pampered like this for a whole year. The driver is a perfect guide, he was still there for us and we experienced a lot of fun with him. He was a good friend and copartner for our children. Now we keep beautiful experiences and memories in our minds and hearts. I can not wait to visit this amazing place again.",Wonderful place with the kindest people. Everyone was super welcoming and willing to answer any questions asked. The cuisine was really delicious aswell. Would definitely comeback here for more days in the future!,"I can confirm this place is just amazing. Very kind staff, surrounding nature, amazing food every day. Will be back soon to spend more days in such quiet and relax place not far away from Ubud."

Bottom-line is that we had a spectacular experience.  The Villa is set in a very private and peaceful location.  All rooms including the outdoor eating area and infinity pool had amazing views of the jungle ravine below.  But what made our experience most special was the care and attention provided by Yande and his team.  They worked continuously during our stay to make sure all of our needs were met.  From preparing freshly cooked excellent meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) to keeping the entire villa clean and tidy to transporting us to wherever we wanted to go on the island to helping us decide on day tours and making the reservations for us, they ensured that all of our needs were met at all times.  Definitely recommend the Villa Sagitta, Yande, and his team to anybody considering visiting Bali.","We’ve had the most amazing week here! The views are one-of-a-kind from everywhere you look and due to its location  it’s as quiet as it gets. The Villa comes equipped with all the facilities you’d expect, and then some. The staff is kind, attentive, professional and go above and beyond. They’re skilled to provide in anything you could wish for, from specific cocktails, to your need and wants for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The cooking is nothing short of amazing and we’ve especially loved the Soto Ayam, Mie Goreng and Villa Sagitta omelet. We’ve had a couple of trips planned by the staff, such as rafting and biking, which is all nearby. Our special and dearest thanks to Agus, Rai, Katon, Joy, Kadek, Pica and Yande who’ve all gone out of their way to make our stay at our ‘home’ Villa Sagitta a truly memorable one. We’ll be sure to return when we visit Bali!",Stayed at Villa Sagitta for 5 years.  What a wonderful experience.  Set right on the edge of a beautiful valley with gorgeous views and lots of privacy.  The hospitality was first class with Yande who catered to our every whim.  The food was so good we eat in every day after lounging by the pool. You cannot find a better place - wonderful amenities in a casual traditional Balinese setting.,"Beautiful villa in the middle of the jungle for the whole family (2-75 years). We stayed 15 persons for five days and had a lovely time. The staff is very kind and the food is great. Lots of trips to take just near by; waterfalls, rafting, temples and Ubud. Don’t hesitate to book Villa Sagita.","One of the most beautiful location to enjoy a blissful yoga retreat in Bali.
I had the incredible opportunity of holding a yoga retreat at Villa Sagitta and every aspect of our stay was amazing. The yoga deck is beautiful overlooking lush green valley.The rooms were clean and comfortable.The open-air concept was amazing!
Villa Sagitta is beautiful and the staff made us feel very comfortable especially Yande. Everything about the place is incredible from the food to the staff. The pool, gardens and grounds are gorgeous. And it was so nice to be just outside of all the Ubud, but still close enough to experience this artsy city.
It is such a beautiful property and experience. I will have wonderful memories of my stay for a very long time. we would LOVE to come back in the future."

The location was perfect and the villa was extremely beautiful and well maintained. My wife had contacted the owner prior to our stay informing them of my birthday and they arranged a nice surprise for me on arrival (including a cake). The rooms were clean and spacious overlooking the rice fields and the pool. All necessary amenities were provided. The pool was refreshing and they had someone come in everyday to do housekeeping. The location was perfect. Secluded from the heavy traffic, making it perfect for relaxing and spending time with family and friends. Getting to the Ubud Centre/market was also a short drive away. I would highly recommend Amanda Villa and will stay there again when visiting Ubud.","Thoughtful owner!
They have complete facilities and utilities..
We love the kitchen.. We stayed as group, and have a perfect time together.. thanks!",Newly built villa. Cozy place with reasonable price. Will come back again later this year,"View good ,location also good quite tobthe centre of ubud need 15 minute by car","Beautiful Villa, clean dan cozy."
ChIJPbOh-UcX0i0RjLaEcqygXjY,Shanti Padma Villa,-8.494190399999999,115.30230490000001,"G842+8WF, Pejeng Kangin, Tampaksiring, Gianyar Regency, Bali 80552, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=3917745388375029388,OPERATIONAL,,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.4,31,,"1. There are no covers or blinds around the kitchen which makes it too easy for rainwater to enter the kitchen area.  Also, the wind was very easy to put out the stove fire considering the wind was coming from a large rice field so the wind was quite strong so the kitchen stove went off too often.

2. The wooden chairs seem to be easily damaged, but the outdoor chairs are very easy to damage.

3. The kitchen equipment is not complete, such as no oven, microwave, pestle, blender, etc. which are commonplace in villas.  There are also no kitchen shelves so it's really very survival & you can enjoy your villa holiday as much as possible

4. The material of the stairs is quite loud if creaks pass through it, so I'm a bit wary

5. The outer window divider on the top floor which is covered with curtains, if you can, don't just use plywood because it's also dangerous & it won't look good 🙏🙏🙏

6. The swing in the park is a bit damaged

7. It's better to use 2 villa staff who are not related to the family because I see almost every day no stop coming in.  Meanwhile, it's possible that you're also sick, so you can't go in while enduring the torment of your body.  So that they can also work together.  So people also have holidays

8. Road access is really difficult.  If you have problems on the inner route, that's understandable.  But the area where you start the entrance is where the steep slope has a lot of bamboo.  The area is slippery & residents and foreigners often have accidents there.  Especially if the rain is too bad to be able to use that road.

9. The road to enter the villa, which is next to the temple, also often gets stuck on motorbikes and can't get up there.  Especially when it's raining, there are so many people pushing the motorbike that it's still difficult to get the motorbike out if it's stuck in the ground that has been exposed to rain.  The road is quite scary.  If it rains in the motorbike parking area when it's flooded, it's covered in moss, so it's really dangerous when you've just arrived or when you're about to leave and the motorbike's gas has just happened.

10. Gas & water are usually backed up and provided including rent of villa but  this payment is different.

11. The villa is in a corner & open area
Please provide security or at least CCTV for safety & things because access to the rice fields is lost.  We are afraid that if there is a crime, who can guess

More or less sorry","Hard to get to by maps, it is sooo confusing. The pathway from the main road to the villa is very extreme for motorcycle to go through, and it's even slippery. The facilities aren't much, especially at the kitchen, it only has one frying pan to cook with. The place is not so bad for you to stay a night or two just by yourself or with your friends. But it's not that great for family stay. Could have been better 👍🏼",Quiet tranquil villa if you need to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The staff are friendly. They have 3 spacious bedroom. A relaxing pool. The villa is surrounded by rice field.,The scenery is very beautiful around there are rice fields..love it😍😍,"Best escape, we love it"
