But especially interesting for group meetings. Have had our open air Cristian ceremony. Large parking ground and areas to organize games. Trekking possible, nice site for Fotos. If it is raining a big dry area with a stage is available. No Installation for BBQ. Clean toilets available. Need coordination with the local administration.","Great place. Nice staff. We were stranded at that part of Bali and could not find a camping ground to pitch our tent. Called the manager and he let us stay for little money.
This place is huge, very nice for outing. A lot of tent like rooms and they even have a little pop up restaurant. Facilities are great too - bathroom is clean with hot water.
Located not far from the main road in Bangli area. Definitely worth a visit.","Cozy and calm. A nice place to stay with family or friends. Baliwoso gave our ""community"" family more than we expected.
My suggestion for the management. I think some maintenance needed on the tent net and toilet facility","Never knew this place till I found 1 blogger talk bout this.
They have camp and some activities to do.
Kids love the playground specially flying fox and the archery.
Bamboo forest was so natural.
Must visit place in Bangli regency","Great place to stay at the heart of Bali island. With outdoor theme, make sure bring your family and friends here and have fun together. Meet the local with their orange field or traditional balinese village. Truly take Pengotan experience home"
