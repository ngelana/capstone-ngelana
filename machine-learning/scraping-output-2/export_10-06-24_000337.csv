Payangan, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali 80571, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=16831432364234628281,OPERATIONAL,+62 814-5700-0107,,"resort_hotel, hotel, lodging",4.7,303,,"This review is not a reflection on the staffs friendliness and it is only about the quality of the accomodation. We will never come back again. The villa needs better management and proper cleaning. The curtains and sofas are filthy, the bathroom windows and edges are mouldy, and the bedsheets and towels have stains and look very dirty too. Most likely due to humidity, the quilt and sheets felt wet and humid, which affected our sleep. The villa lacks items such as a hair dryer (the villa staff provided us with two hairdryers after we asked for it, one of which was faulty), no bins provided in the rooms (only one in the bathrooms), no hand wash provided next to the sink, no toiletries kit, and no tissues box provided in the living room area. There are ants everywhere, including on the bathroom floors. The location is very isolated and far from Ubud city. Overall, there are many villas and hotels in Bali/Ubud; don‚Äôt stay here as you can easily find something better.","It‚Äôs a good villas
I would say it‚Äôs a comfortable place for staycationÔºÅbeautiful place and amazing food ü•∞
Nevertheless, there is some sort of stuff still need to improve
How could a big and beautiful villa DIDNT PROVIDE A HAIRDRYER? ü•≤ We were so lazy to swim in here because of that
Furthermore, total rooms we rent are 3 but they just gave us 1 toothbrush and toothpaste for 1 room? I can‚Äôt believe it
And last night when I and my family arrived back here after 1 long day trip, we need to wait 10-15 mins for the room key
Wow I can‚Äôt say more.. we were tired and yesterday was so cold due to the season (it‚Äôs raining almost half of day) and we want to have a hot shower and take a rest immediately but we couldn‚Äôt get in to our room.. it‚Äôs disappointing
Overall this villas are great, the view is great too, the access to here is a little bit far from the city and all tourist destinations.. if you want to traveling to another place, I don‚Äôt think this place is suitable.. it‚Äôs more suitable for staycation..
The views are great and stunning, but some of things just need to improve","First of all, I have to say, the staff was really friendly.
It was very nice that you have a private pool... but it was awfully cold and dirty. They couldn't do anything about the temperature of the pool so we didn't have a chance to use the pool at all, cause it was VERY cold. The food was also very dissapointing. You didn't have a lot of choice. And the taste of the food was just not good.
Also there was this terrible penitrating smell coming from the bedroom. We mentioned it, and they did gave us a small aromatherapydevice, which helped a little. There was also a leak from the ceiling.
Locationwise, the villa's are reall deep in the jungle so if you want to go the the city of ubud, for example, you spend like 30-40 minutes on the road , if there is no traffic. So you really need a car. A motor is not very handy in this area because of the rainy weather during september.
For us, it was really dissapointing, because we booked the villa for it's private pool, which we couldn't use at all.","A great villa, so much potential. I just have a few complaints, the tub lacked hot water when i stayed there so the tub remained useless. The pool was dirty too and i didn't want to use it, such a shame. Also, the access to the villa was terrifying, there was 3/4 landslides when i went there. Imagine if i was in the area when it happened...","Located far from the business of the city, very suitable for those who want to stay in a quiet place.

We stayed for one night here after driving 17 hours from Jakarta to Bali, I spent most of my time sleeping here, but my family enjoyed this hotel.

Tried the breakfast in the private pool, the room itself is very comfy, large bathroom complete with bathtub. Very nice!

Why not 5-star? The hotel sign was fell because of the heavy rain and caused one of our tires flat when we drove on it (couldn‚Äôt do anything since the rain was very heavy and no other way to get to the hotel.
The staffs services also can be improved, at least they can come to our car door to give us the umbrella when it rains.

But I think this was not our last visit there, looking forward to come there again in the future!"
