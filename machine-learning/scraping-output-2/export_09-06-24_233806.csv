We arrived with high expectations after reading reviews and looking at photos. However, when we arrived and went into the first room (house), the saw 2 big rats running on the beams under the ceiling (near the bed).
The rats were not afraid of us and continued to run. And this is with 6 peoples in the room at that moment and in daylight. I can‚Äôt imagine what they do at night.
The owner responded to this by saying that this is part of nature because of the rice fields and she does not see a problem.
All the people in our group didn't want to stay here because we can't imagine how you can sleep with rats running over your bed.
When we asked about a refund, the owner refused to provide one.
But, to be fair, they recommended us a hotel nearby when we we‚Äôre sitting at the lobby and trying to do the last minute booking.","This place is simply amazing! Had a very good sleep, the weather is cool and pleasant, small river and ricefield view, nice breakfast üòç","Good atmosphere, clean,beautiful villa

we booked the last in the row of cottages. this one is very private and has good views of the tropical forrest and a  rice field terrace. exactly like pics on the website.  fire flies.
no ac,  we had the fan on and the doors open. there was a good quality fly net (klamboe). we slept so good.
we walked through the Jatiluwi rice fields and could leave the car at the hotel.
we would go back without hesitation.","The staff are cordial and accommodating, nice location with a beautiful view of Bedugul. BE WARNED the dog situation is out of control. There are 4 strays who live on the property, who fight and use the land as a bathroom and mating grounds. There is NON STOP dog barking all night long. The neighbors also have an extremely agitated and loud dog on a leash. The neighbors throw rocks at the strays which insights more noise. The property owners and community banjar needs to address the dog situation, as it really ruins the experience. You will NOT have a peaceful night here!",Wow room! Wow view! Nice spot for morning yoga I found:) very hot water. Walking distance to everything around and friendly to dogs! The menu was quite little for me but the Gong resto just 2 minutes away so no problem! Definitely will be back there:),"I recently stayed at Yeh Baat Lodge with family. Marvellous lodge, overlooking the river, ricepaddy and mountain views. Excellent service, lovely meals and very friendly staffs. Room was spacious, well equipped, clean and artistic. A great place to stay in Jatiluwih. Definitely returning again :)","Beautiful scenery here.
Room are very nice.
Great price, perfect to relax by the river.
Very impressed by the landscape around."

She is very warm-hearted and the food is delicious for reasonable prices!
I had Bubur Bali Beras Merah which is traditional Balinese breakfast and it was delicious b","Foods were really good! We were impressed. Ikan mujair goreng, ikan mujair nyat nyat, soto ayam. Delicious, cheap, fresh, served by a friendly staff.
But the service took a bit long, it was like they had to prepare them from scratch.","The service is very nice, the food is what you pay for. It's good and cheap. The coconut shake that I had was very good and sweet. The waiting time is a bit longer than I would have expected. Worth a visit if your on a budget.","Stopped by just for coffee, tea and banana fritters. Everything was very tasty, the banana fritters were especially delicious. The owner was very friendly.","Lovely little resto, away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Jatiluwih ‚ò∫. I had the Soto Ayam and it was the nicest I've tasted in Bali. The owner was super-friendly. It took a bit longer, because she made it fresh and used fresh ingredients."

The staff is very friendly and we received a Papaya as a gift.,"We came here following the good reviews seen on google but we're totally disappointed by this restaurant. The view is great but that is all. Food is very expensive and not good, chicken satay was cold, we took package family (for 4 people, and we were 3 people) but there were nearly enough for 2 people. Plus they forgot the vegetables salad. It was the worst restaurant we went in Bali","A humble eatery in stark contrast to the buffer names nearby.  Friendly owner Pak Warung takes pride in his home grown passion fruit, water spinach, tomatoes, and papaya, and he makes delicious dishes and juices from them.  I was allowed to roam around good compound which has a nice relaxing ambience with the noon rain splattering on the ground.  I even got passion fruits and a papaya to take home! We should support this sort of home restaurants more!","Never ever go here! I came at night because I needed WiFi and food. Everything was closed and no lights on, they gave me a menu and everything was so ridiculously expensive. I chose the cheapest things on the menu, 3 of them were not available, when it arrived, it was not what I ordered. When the bill came they charged me 70,000 for a nasi campur which I didn't order. When I tried to explain he said that he knew I didn't order it.
The staff hardly speak English, I couldn't really explain to them I wanted take away and when they finally understood the waitress picked up the food with her bare hands and started putting it in a bag.
Terrible experience.
I advise you not to go there and be ripped off.",Good place to enjoy the green view of Jatiluwih's Rice Terracev with a majestic view of Mount Batukaru on the west. It also a good place to held a camp activity because it provide us with a wide field for the tent. Not forget to mention that this place also sells various indonesian food there.
