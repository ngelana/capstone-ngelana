Each one of them had a pleasing personality. Breakfasts can be better, tastes bland. No coffee dispensing machine at the breakfast. The pool is clean with attentive staff always available for service.

Overall a very good experience. And yes not to forget to mention their bed arrangement upon arrival. The housekeeping staff is commendable with their effortlessly job and eye for detail.","stayed in this hotel for a school trip. changed my room a few times (room 3309,3126). while i applaud the staff for being nice and helpful, all three rooms had paranormal activities. when i highlighted this concern to the staff, she simply said ""don't worry the ghosts are trying to welcome you but they won't do anything""

horrible response to be honest. would never stay here again.","The overall experience staying here was excellent
The staff, service and housekeeping was too good. The rooms were conditioned. Also i would like to mention food, it was too good and they offer good Indian food. We met Manda here she took care of our stay. She was cooperative and friendly too.","Room with pool access is highly recommended.
Online taxis not allowed inside the hotel ,have to walk till near circle k but was provided a drop till circle k by asking at the reception.
Good decoration at our room before checkin.
Overall  a very good experience.
Thanks Amanda","Amazing hotel, great food and at a cheap price. The hotel provides shuttles for free to and from the beach which makes days out that much easier. You can either eat in your room with a 24/7 room service or eat by the poolside. Christina and Trisna who served us made our experience extra special making sure we had the best hospitality possible. 100% would recommend!!!"

Good service and cleanliness. Room 310 - 312 (if im not mistaken) got sunrise at balcony,"Based on my experience, the hotel atmosphere was really calming and quiet - it's comfortable to stay here. The hotel had a nice swimming pool, and each room seemed to have a balcony facing toward the pool. The staff was also friendly and helpful.

For breakfast, they provided almost the same thing every day, such as bread-jam-cereal for western style and rice-veggie-noodle-chicken/else for local style. As for the taste, it was just so so. Therefore, if anyone wants to explore different meals, I suggest you book the room with no breakfast. You can go to Sunset Road or nearby to have some meal options.

The room was cleaned daily, but I do think the cleaning must be improved. The amenities were provided such as for bathroom: toothbrush/paste, soap, shampoo, towel, but no hair dryer; for room: chiller, water heater, coffee-tea-sugar, cups, mineral water, android tv, wifi, etc., but no slippers. The room wall might not be too soundproof because you might still hear things dropping from next door or below.

Grabcar/Gocar pickups aren't allowed in the hotel area because there's a fixed respected agreement with locals due to car/motorcycle rent business in the area and its competitive costs. Optionally, you can walk to the T-junction area near the hotel (appx. 200m) to use grab/gojek service. To pick up directly at the hotel, Bluebird taxi (app) service can be used.

Overall, it's a great place to stay. I recommend this hotel to anyone who looks for a strategic place to stay with moderate price and great room space. It's also family-friendly.","The best room we have stayed so far. Super clean, big and well mantained. If the location is good for you, then you cannot get a better room for the price","I stayed in this hotel for one month or even more. Room was not big, but enough for me and 2 children. The staff was helpful and very kind for me and children. I loked that it was balcony in the room.","Great staff always willing to help! Beds are really comfortable and they are clean. Hotel has a beautiful pool and also have scooters for you to rent. Next time I come to Bali,  definitely going to come back here great place!"

Perfect for a morning dip.","I should’ve scrolled all the recent reviews about this hotel prior booking. Not allowed to check in early - I requested to check in one hour earlier since we arrived 2.5hrs before 2pm but request was denied with the excuse of room not yet ready. I can see clearly from the lobby that one of the pool access room (can be seen in front of the lobby) was perfectly ready way before 2pm - which later was meant to be our room. The furnitures were old, cushions on the sofa were smelly, the odor from the wooden wardrobe was quite bad, toilet walls were yellow & old kitchen utensils were provided. Coffee cups looks like theyve been there more than 5 years, stained! Not to forget the kettle inside was filthy dirty. Requested for 1 extra pillow & I was shocked for the first time ever I was asked to pay for 1 extra pillow per night. Been to Bali few times & other hotels but this is the first time ever I got charged for this. One of the staff did well when attended my simple request. Dont expect much, the location was a bit excluded but quiet, still easy access if youre riding motorbike & cars. No Grab cars allowed to go inside the area. Breakfast was so-so , pool was ok but a bit rundown you can see the green algae at the edge of the pool. Short stay is ok for this but I am not coming back.","As other people mentioned, facilities are old like chipped plate, CD players or stained sheets. However, still clean and spacious room, even shower area.
What I like is well equipped like as comfy sofa or a knife and cutting board. And long swimming pool.
Location is also quiet, even the road in front of hotel is not paved and rainy season have bit problem.
Overall, comfortable stay with kind staffs (quite many, everyday different receptionists at the reception).",All the staff is humble and helpfull goodplace to who want to quite and comfortable place to stay and i think all for the sheets and towel its new because have a good white colour i hope this hotel will be better than before and give the best service from the best,"Good ambiance, nice room, clean and friendly staff

Would not recommend for month long stays. I should also note the rooms available for monthly stays on the 3rd floor are of different value then nightly stays on floor 1-2 which is expected. I just wouldn’t recommend the room that I was in compared to other rooms for similar price points.","I was living there for longer time, everything is great and the stuff is great…

Not worth the price that is asked for, that is a repeating issue with bali accommodations.","Cleanliness is an issue. The room smelled like smoke, and the bed was dirty. The toilet wouldn't work properly. The pool itself is so dirty that it's actually a safety hazard.

every rooms have balcony with view to the pool. the pool was in standard length, you can swim for sport, but very short width, less than for 2 persons swimming side to side. so you can't use the pool more than alone.
on the first morning, they served us late breakfast. on the second morning, they knocked our doors more than twice to take the plate in hurry, we haven't even woke up. they wanted to take the plate quickly (they dont have enough plate for all the guests??). on the third morning, they served only ONE portion of breakfast because i forgot to registered my menu on the concierge??????
but the security was very great, he helped us take our friend to bed on 3am drunk. on almost 4am we wanted to go to the nearest convinient store by walking, but we were barked by a lot of dogs after few steps out of the hotel. we got scared and decided to go back upstairs, when the woman on concierge asked us if we wanted to use her motorcycle.

Near a few marts. Nice & friendly staff. AC works well. Wi-Fi is good. TV is an alright size.

The Bad: Bed is hard and uncomfortable. Bed blankets, towels, toilet paper, and soap are not included in rental price, so you have to buy your own. The bathroom and kitchen have an open roof, so many mosquitoes get into your room. There is a termite problem as well. The shower water smells like sulfur, and the water does not get cold, which is not great for a bathroom without AC and an open roof. Both swimming pools are very hot and not refreshing at all. Many electrical power outages as well. Walls are paper thin, and you can hear your next-door neighbours coughing, their TV, and their conversations.

They are focusing too much on exterior upgrades, where they should be spending their time and money fixing the interior of the rental units.","Emily was really helpful. I stayed here a week while I waited until my permanent apartment was ready.
People sometimes need to realise they are on the ground floor of a small villa so there may be 1 or 2 creepy crawlies!
Room was big, separate kitchen and dining space and a huge shower. Working space, TV and the bed was comfortable. Location is good, seems like it’s only 10 mins from everywhere.
If you’re looking for luxury, PAY for luxury. This was exactly as I expected and some.","Worst serviced apartment I ever stayed in on Bali. They don’t tell you that you won’t get a simple sleeping blanket (nor towels) included in the price, so I had to sleep the first night with my own pool towel.. the front desk (staff) respond times are ridiculous, sometimes up to a day, sometimes they just don’t care at all and don’t respond. Basic communication is not possible and they don’t understand the simplest task making me wait 1 hour in the night because they locked my door without me having a key (they were doing maintenance and should leave the gate door open for me, as it was communicated). The pool is dirty and i even asked  „does it get cleaned?“ they just lied. The kitchen is not equipped with anything so expect to spend another 3million on basic equipment for the kitchen. Never staying here again.",Stayed here for a little more than a week. The staff were friendly and helpful but we had to move rooms 3 times. Once the toilet broke and overflowed so we had to move.

You will not suspect that it’s a coffee shop from the main street. Once you arrive you are greeted by small garden park then tables on the first floor and a mezzanine leading to second floor where they store artifacts from the archipelago and a sixties rock’n’roll flower power shop where they sell bohemian collectibles then some outdoor tables. The cashier where you place your orders is located at the centre of it all and then a few more tables that come out from that 70s style. The place has no air conditioner but it’s cozy enough with the fans and natural breeze. I had cuankie which is the bandung take on the street food version of meatball soups without the so-un. Coffee is quite good. I had single origin sundanese beans ice japanese coffee cold brew that turned out to be quite bold with distinctive taste. They do have independent magazines to read. The overall atmosphere reminds me of the grandparents’ house. Old but cozy enough to make you want to stay for hours after a night of partying? Hehe. Busted! Anyways, do pay them a visit to get away from bali party scene. They have donuts and if you have been good and come at the right time, it comes with your coffee. Sober yet?","A good place to work or hang out with friends. It may look small from the street, but the place is actually quite spacious inside. Since the building face the west, the lighting is great especially if you visit in afternoon when the sun is about to go down. It has a homy and cozy feeling with a humble staff, good choice of music which is not too loud, good food, and good drinks. Will be my comfort place to work and hang around with friends!"

The kitchen cabinets were covered with fungus…. Curtains, night lights, sofa and chair covers covered in stains… we stayed three nights and I didn’t use the sofa even once, because felt disgusting to sit on it.. We arrived in the middle of the night and imagine to sleep in this environment… I asked staff to clean everything next day, and even after that, I still didn’t feel the place is clean.

1) please clean the dishes troughoutly, the dishes in my room still has oil on it
2) repair your plumbing, the water always logged in the sink and in the shower chamber
3) please use better water resource, because water from the faucet is so smelly
4) please clean the room oftenly, some places still has a pile of dust.

Other things just nice.","Location is great. Staff are friendly enough. Unfortunately I've had few issues with this place. And management have yet to get back to me. I booked through hotels dot com and advise to never use it hotels dot com ever again.
My bed was filthy on check in. Stained dirty sheets. I had no towels in the room, food packaging under the bed so it had not been cleaned, and for the first 3 or 4 days I had nothing but complaints. No water pressure. Bath tap didn't work. TV only has local stations. The water they provide the room. Is enough for 1 cup of tea and brush your teeth. Overall my stay has been quite average and would definitely choose differently had I known these issues be happening. I found that the advertised room and what you get is not the same as when you arrive.

first impression, the place looks alright for the cheap price we paid.

first night, smelly duvet and pillow.
second day, toilet cannot flush and bathroom flooded.
second night, huge rain and the roof of the whole room was leaking, there is no initiative from the staffs to change our room.
third day, in the morning it was a big flood on the street that the car cannot even pass nor we can walk out of our room. by the end of the day, when we returned to the hotel, we found that our room was not cleaned at all, so we asked for a new room and they gave us one (a dirty one)
they said the new room was already cleaned, however we found the floor and the bed is so dirty, and there was a cigarette bud on the sink, so we asked them to clean everything very late in the evening with our supervision.

conclusion, never stay in this place again."

The rooms, pool, and kitchen were all very clean. The option to rent a scooty is also available at this villa. Caretaker Nyoman was very professional, she ensured our stay was comfortable. This villa also had billiards table. The swimming pool also had a floating tray for floating breakfast, we bought all the stuff and designed floating breakfast.","Absolutely loved our stay here , so much hospitality. Very clean and fresh , good pool table and very nice pool to relax in . Bedrooms and bathroom are very nice and the host miss Nyoman is a very lovely women . Good menu for breakfast and they deliver very cheap . £5 taxi to beach . Plenty of bars and shops in surrounding area . Very impressed with the villa . Thanks Miss Nyoman we loved every minute","Super homeyy and comfortable. Nice pool and it has pool lamp so we can swim at night. Netflix was okay, there was no problem with the internet connection (wifi). The only weakness just no parking space for car inside the fence. But i think it's okay to park near the villa.","Had a tough experience here, from broken air conditioning units to being sucked on by 20 mosquitoes in one night. It was tough. Life was tough... We stayed for 3 nights, so the owners tried to make up for it on the 2nd and 3rd night with more repellents and what not, but by then I've been ithhing like crazy. The TV channel choices weren't great, we literally could only watch 5 English channels.

That said, the villa has a small pool, 3 big rooms with king sized beds and a pool table, so that made the stay better. The maid doesn't speak English so you need to try your best to speak in Bahasa.","Small swimming pool , 2m x 6m  nett size,  there is an old  9"" billiard table, the balls and table cloth have to be changed, 1 main room at 1st floor and 2 room at 2nd floor,......not bad at all. There will be additional charge IDR 30K / person when check in for Police administration report."
