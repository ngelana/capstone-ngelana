In the remote area he made us feel like home .only four rooms are there but I have to say I had the best feeling while staying there because of the nature of the care taker.
Rooms are basic nothing luxury.we stayed in garden room view.but had the best stay.","If you are going to Bebandem, don‚Äôt hesitate to book your stay at Dana! It is everything that you could hope for ‚Äî and the beautiful marketing lives up to its promise. Simple, Balinese style rooms right on the Nature, with modern touch truly hot water in the shower. The pool is sparkling and long enough to swim real laps. The food is literally the best food I have had during my recent Bali stay. Balinese dishes with fresh healthy ingredients, made surprisingly quickly  and always presented beautifully. But more than anything, the people working here are THE BEST. They seem to love their work and will genuinely do anything to help you, including arrangements to tour temples, go snorkeling or diving‚Ä¶ anything you want. Book it while you can‚Äî this place won‚Äôt stay secret for long. THANK YOU, Team Dana! ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèº","Dana‚Äôs retreat is a lovely place for a quiet rest after long adventure days!

If you are looking for a little heavenly cocoon in the middle of the magnificent ricefields with a panoramic view on the Mont Agung, well this is for you!

With only 4 bedrooms, and a magnificent swimming pool, it is a small haven of peace. The manager is adorable and will make you feel at home!

Believe us, you won't want to leave!","Amazing place to stay and enjoy real Bali! The view is stunning, ricefield everywhere around and Mt Agung staring at you!
Breakfast is really good and the slated pool is amazing after a day exploring this beautiful area!"

This spot offers breathtaking vistas of lush rice fields, complemented by the gentle whispers of nature. Every glance seems like a painting, every moment feels like a dream. It's a place where nature's magnificence truly overwhelms the senses. A must-visit!","This is a starting point for the village rice field trekking in the area. You can get a guide for a very fair price there and take the 1,5 hours Tour through amazing unspoiled nature (Teganan). The bridge was more beautiful in the past, now you definitely need solid shoes, don't go in sandals.",Nice place for tracking,beautiful rice terrace  trekking  start point,"Really great views, but be sure to visit it with a guide to know where you're heading."
