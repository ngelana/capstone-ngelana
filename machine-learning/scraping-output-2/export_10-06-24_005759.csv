If I need to stay in Sukawati I will stay again. Breakfast was great. Basic rice or noodles but can also accommodate western diets.,"When I arrived, the water in the shower was not working. The rooms are ok, but the noise from the road and dogs barking all night. It is not possible to have a comfortable sleep.","the place is comfortable and clean, very quiet and suitable for those who don't like noise, the cleanliness of the rooms is most satisfying, thank you to Bli Sony üëåüèª",I wish I can give a 6-star rating. The location wasn‚Äôt far enough from the beaches. They provided kitchen for us to cook. Clean environment & swimming pool. Safe & secure.,This was a great stay. The rooms are well air conditioned and cleaned. The two ladies running the place were fabulous at their job and very friendly. The only complaint is that the road noise is a little loud.

Pictures provided online are deceiving. Looks nothing like in reality. Booked through Airbnb. Could not stay for more than a day. They charged us inr 28000 for one night. They even asked us not to give negative reviews about the place. It's listed as villa. No basic amenities like water to drink also has to be paid for.. the other villas we stayed at Bali provided water cans. Don'topt for this place if going as a family. You'll regret,We booked and played mths ago . Only to be cancelled on the day before we arrive . This took 2 days to sort out . Asham as my holiday was ment to be stress free,Good,Ok,

There are numerous restaurants within walking distance, The building is a delight, has a small kitchen and aircondition, is comfortable and is cleaned every day. The host Wayan and his wife Komang could not be more helpful, often presenting me with fruit from the garden and sharing a meal.
