I love this cafe! I come here to read, to drink refreshing drinks, i come for the good coffee and of course to eat the best food! ‚òïÔ∏è

On a wednesday they have 40k burgers, the Buttermilk fried chicken burger is AMAZING. I could probably eat it everyday. üçî

AND on a Fridays they have 50% off on their Pizzas! üçï

Some of my other favourite meal options are the Chipotle Chicken Burrito Bowl and the Beef Ragu Rigatoni. ü•óüçù

Very good service, friendly and fast (this is the most important)
Definitely recommended and will comeback for their other menu)","Delicious coffee, chilled water and relaxed seating environment for a lazy morning sit. The cinnamon roll is delicious while the breakfast burger only so-so. The bread is extra buttery and the bacon is pretty gnarly. Egg was the redeeming value for the sandwich.","Good coffee, fresh food and good service. Always a good choice","We found this place only a 2 minute walk from our villa (shoutout to Villa River Bali for anyone looking for a little slice of paradise!) on our first morning here in Canggu.

The coffee was amazing, the staff were so friendly & attentive and the food was delicious! The 70k breakfast deal works out roughly 5.60 GBP so UNREAL value for money while not compromising on the quality. You can choose from 4 dishes on this deal plus a juice & a coffee or matcha - perfect size for breakfast!

I later found our while stalking their instagram page that a blogger I had followed for years back in the UK near my hometown came here when she was traveling years ago and tagged them in a post - what a small world.

A must visit place if you‚Äôre nearby!!","Been here 3 times so far, it‚Äôs perfect every time üíìüôè Love the 70k breakfast special."

I went with the El Cartel which had just the right amount of bite to it. The beef patty was thick and super juicy. Great price for a combo meal too.

The restaurant is located on a main road and across the street there was some heavy construction going on, making it not so pleasant to eat there. Food can be ordered for delivery on Gojek/Grab if you prefer it a bit quieter.
Fully recommend this place.",I was welcomed by Sri a beautiful and very smiley person and recommended me the chicken Curry Indonesian style. Really nice music good sound. Really great atmosphere. Nice breeze while eating that keeps your cool.,"Food is amazing, best burgers of Bali. Prices are amazing and taste is phenomenal. Never had such a great burger in my life! The kitchen is beautifully clean and the staff is very kind. Only thing to mark is maybe the order of the dishes that come. We had first te burgers, later the onion rings and after that the fries. Not a problem for me tho.","Good service, got the burger in 15 minutes, paid 126k. Portion size is enough to get full.

What I adore about this place, aside from the food, is the comfortable and homey atmosphere. It's the kind of spot where you instantly feel at ease, making it perfect for a laid-back meal. My personal favorites are the chicken creamy pesto and Sate ‚Äì they're simply outstanding!","I recently stumbled upon a charming cafe that quickly became my go-to spot for authentic Balinese cuisine. Nestled in a cozy corner, it's the perfect place for a post-pole practice meal, whether it's lunch or dinner.

Their menu is a delightful journey through the flavors of Bali. their nasi goreng, a flavorful fried rice dish with a medley of ingredients. It was both satisfying and comforting, offering a taste of Bali's street food culture.

The cafe's laid-back atmosphere and friendly staff make it an ideal place to unwind after a strenuous pole practice. The Bali-inspired decor adds to the ambiance, making it feel like a mini-escape to this Indonesian paradise.","I forgot to take the photo menu but all of my foods were soo tasty!!! The creme brulee.... OMG, definitely will be my favorite!!

The staff were so friendly and helpful! I wasn't expecting too much when I arrived but they totally shocked me with the flavors and quality!!!

Thank you and I will come again soon!!","This place has the best cappuccino I've had in Bali, which is saying something. The food is also great, with Indonesian and Western options. Came here almost every day for breakfast and occasionally for lunch and dinner during my stay in Bali.","The place where you can enjoy a lot of choice of delicasy foods and the prices are extremely affordable.
