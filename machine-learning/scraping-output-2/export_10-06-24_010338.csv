Plus point for the ambiance, so green.

Food is actually tasty, we tried some of the recommendation i.e Chicken Balado, Sweet Soy Beef, and Cinammon French Toast. Zen Garden for drink tastes refreshing. All pretty good, but for Cinnamon Toast is a big portion for typically a dessert. Prices are affordable.

A little disappointment was for the food hygiene, as I found hair on my dish","The place was gorgeous, somewhere like this is definitely difficult to find in the middle of Denpasar. The rainforest/jungle feel was what made me come here and when I arrived I was certainly awed by the location. However despite everything all else was not what I expected. Place was way too crowded. Seats are right next to each other and there is barely any space from the person next to you, especially if they come in a group. Whilst it is outdoor and airy, the place itself is actually tiny with steep stone stairs. What disappointed me was that this is far from the tranquil space it had seemed due to the crowd. I'd only recommend this to people who wanted outdoor space but don't mind the crowds. Aside from being a new place everyone wanted to try, prices are affordable, cheap even (rice bowl costs around 35k) and this is one of the things that has managed to attract quite the crowd. Though be prepared to manage your expectations for the food when you only had to pay that much. Drinks are quite refreshing (I ordered the zen garden option). They did say they were planning to expand the place but the place that they planned to open was downstairs, also a small space with what would accommodate only limited seatings. Toilets are clean and spacious though soaps need to be checked and refilled.",Good and cozy places.  Tje music lil bit to loud. But the view. Natural garden and the river is stunning. Love the food  and affordable  their signature drink is superb. Refreshing,"Love the vibe! Hidden gem in Denpasar area. For people who love chill feeling in the nature while enjoying some good foods, I think you will like this place.","Q : The food wasn't delicious, everything was cold, like it had been prepared but not reheated, We came because of tiktok fyp 😔 apparently everything was zonk 🤬

S : The waiter was not polite, the food had not yet finished, he was asked which dirty plates could be taken? less polite 😔 buru buru banget mau di kemanain sih piringnya 🥹

C : We came to a dirty table and asked to be cleaned several times without any attention, finally we asked for tissue to wipe the table, we were told to bring our own tissue to the cashier's desk, what was the flow like?"

Food was good, good portion and still reasonably priced. Though my grilled fish was bit on the dry side. But it was still enjoyable.

Just a feedback to the chefs for the pizza... do not use ""TOMATO KETCHUP"" to replace Tomato paste. Italians will scream and horrified if they eat your pizzas. Probably okay for Indonesian costumers, but if you are serving Europeans... this will get thumbs down.

Staff were friendly and accommodating.","Well here is a place not many will venture on, I was near to the Living World Mall, so just came to explore. Grilled chicken is good. Love the chili as well. Service is excellent here.
There is a dam nearby, you can sit closer down to enjoy the sound water flowing.
Came on a tues evening.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is nature and comfy, the taste of the food are delicious and they also have a playground for children under 12. The price is quite affordable with the right portion.","My first time to have lunch beside a dam! People here call it Oongan Dam, maybe this restaurant gets its name from the Dam. A resto with spacious parking, strategic location, homey ambience and architecture, greeny areas and cool kids playground. Absolutely a family restaurant. The menu is ranging from Indonesian, Japanese, Italian. We ordered grilled fish and totally like it (eventhough it is quite spicy,  so you may consider fried fish for your kids). Surprisingly, their sushi was good, with reasonable price. My son love their margarita Pizza so much. The price is Bandung/Jakarta cafe standard, around 50k -100k for food. You can also having shared meals with their package options. Freely pick your place, inside with table and chairs or outside in gazebo with lesehan style. You choose!","Came there for family dinner. The atmosphere of this place is so beautiful. The food is so good, my favourite is the calm, the prawn, and cumi goreng tepung.
All the family is so satisfied"

The flavors were good, and the presentation was nice, but the temperature of the food was a letdown. It’s a decent place to eat if you're not too particular about your food being piping hot. Hopefully, they can improve on this aspect in the future","Having a birthday dinner here. Totally worth the money, the portion is big and delicious. The beef tasted fresh and the staff were super friendly. We're having a gyukatsu set and I love it! The  cold ocha is a free refill. Next time I want to try their other menu. Def.

And ny favorite dressing for the salad is sesame mayo.. the place is clean , the staff is kind and so helpfull.","Price to service quality is poor, the food delivered 50 minutes to 1 hour, meat taste plain, they dimmed the light in the middle of dining, without advance notice. Said that it was from building management automatically but other outlets still on bright light which causes inconvenience.
I’d rather choose another restaurant available there at the mall.
And also there are kids running around the restaurant screaming, it’s a restaurant not a playground.",Food selection was great but katsu was a little too oily for me. It was really good though but can be a bit much if you order two katsu. Their tofu selection was good. The customer service was okay but their attitude was really good towards each other which was nice to see.

It's not too chaotic, overall it's just better. Another reason is because:

1. Solaria at Level 21 Mall is tucked away, right next to the game zone, which can be noisy and crowded.

2. Solaria at TSM Bali has poor signal, I don't understand why there's bad signa in the TSM area. It's often crowded, and I'm not comfortable with the place, it's just a personal preference.

3. Solaria in MBG is too hot and somewhat chaotic when it's busy, and the space is cramped.

4. Solaria in Tuban at the airport is quite far, and I sometimes eat there when I have a flight out of town, but it's just okay and a bit pricey.
