The hike is free but we got forced to pay 300k for entrance. We got threatened by the people at the entrance and ended up paying them. They started recording us and threatened to call emigration and getting us deported,"One of the most challenging yet magical peaks in Bali, an absolutely incredible experience and Bali's most sacred mountain.
Be aware this is still an active volcano so check the conditions first before attempting to scale it.
Go with a registered guide, pack warm, wind-proof clothes, plenty of water, and be careful on the last section as it's very steep, very sharp and very dangerous.",Been on the top of mount 2016. The view & sunrise really great!,"One of my favourite place in Bali. It's been so many times going there, like 27 times, but never bored of the vibe, the views, the challenges, the fun, everything was just right. And I feel like this mountain is already like my big brother, always giving me peace when I needed the most. Being there was one of a kind, especially thru the Pasar Agung Melipir path of trekking/hiking route, the best views and challenges.
Be sure you are brave enough to go there, and always do the safety first everytime on a hiking.","If you have an extra day in Bali, Mount Agung is definitely the peak you want to consider to reach. With its pyramid like shape, you don't need to worry about setting up tent and all those trouble preparation for mount climbing, just carry enough water to last. At the main summit you'll be rewarded with far reaching view of Bali and as far as Mt Rinjani in Lombok."
