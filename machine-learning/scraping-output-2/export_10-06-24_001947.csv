The staff is super friendly and so cute. You get the whole estate to yourself. It's located in a smaller quiet village (about 45 mins from Ubud center). Although it's a bit secluded, it's very easy to arrange for transportation through the villa staff.","JdB is an enchanting place to rest, reset and getaway from daily hustles and bustles, all thanks to Dayu — the beautiful soul behind it all.

We keep coming back for her cooking – Ayam Tuturuga is our favourite! Other places might be fancier, but they don’t have Dayu and her sister in it. It truly feels like coming home and being embraced by your warm, lovely aunt.

Can’t wait to spend another time here!","Tranquil peace full retreat villa .. if that what you looking for.. this place is perfect. 2 villas with saparate family and Tv/office room with huge tropical garden,swimming pool.","Great place, amazing service.","Amazing… wake up in the jungle. Service is nice, a perfect place to calm down"

We got a very nice surprise, finding and small and familiar place. The couple inside were gentle and they cooked our meal from scratch, slicing and cutting every ingredient for us. It was the BEST Mie goreng we tried on our holidays in Bali. Many people also ordered to take away but is available to eat inside.
I Hope to visit them again soon",,,,
