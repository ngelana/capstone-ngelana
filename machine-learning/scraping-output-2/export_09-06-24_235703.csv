It was a nice place, good coffee, friendly services, great ambience. It took us 50 minutes to get here, but it was all worth it, especially because we are looking for a calming place.
For the food itself, it was OK, but for our taste it needs a bit more salt (we tried the signature pizza and also the chicken popcorn and the curly potato). It will be a great experience if the taste is not that bland.","A second chance redeemed:

Read some of the negative review and went here to experience it myself. Very skeptical due to a very isolated place, went through small road with forest view. Greeted with more ethnical entrance.

But after went inside, greeted by friendly staff and quite amazed with the beautifuly designed cafe. Lots of open spaces. The herbal tea with some dried purple flower infused was refreshing. Love the fried banana.

In the end, it was quite worth all the hype and the long travel. They improve for sure but hopefully can maintain.","[ Honest & Comprehensive review : Visit on 28 Jan 2024)

A regular cafe with rice field view. The taste is average. Not really accessible in the midst of rural and small alley, the parking slots front of the cafe is very limited or possibly you gotta walk 1.1km afar for the provided parking slot. you might wait the food for so long since they ain‚Äôt  ready for a high traffic guest moment. Despite all, it is okay for one time visit but I dont think i would making my 2nd time since it took 1hr++ to drive by and the experience wasn‚Äôt really satisfied me.

For the visitor: better visit on the weekday
For the owner: improve the service, parking slots availibility or all the hype happening now will be just one time and gone.

Overall,
Ambience: 7/10
Food : 5/10
Service : 5/10
Value for money : 6/10
Location : 4/10","Good vibe, especially the foood. The parking lot still need develop. Cushion of sofa still need to be cleanüôèüèΩ The staff is so friendlyü§ç","We enjoyed the food, the natural concept, and the staff are sweet and doing their best..
Definitely our new favourite places to eat out.."
