They have tables spread around the garden, widely separated, so you have your privacy, and the view is stunning. All the food is super, I really love the ayam betutu and the soup. Off the beaten path, for sure a stop of you're around here at lunch time","First off; the view is absolutely stunning. The food was pretty good. We had ayam betutu and the chicken fell of the bone and was very tender.

Also had a chicken club sandwich, it was not overly deluxe but tasty. The fries were a bit thin, but overall okay. Lastly I tried the asparagus soup, which was more a bouillon, and a bit salty.

If I‚Äôm in the neighborhood i would go again.

P.S. the lady waiter seemed to have a bit of an off day, wasn‚Äôt the smiliest of people üòâ

The smoothie and the juice were yummy.","Visited this place for the first time in Tuesday, 10 November 2020. In fact, I pass it almost every week on may way home to my village.

Never expected that it is a great place to stop and have something to eat or to drink here.

It has ample parking space for more that 10 cars. What's next? It looks as if it were a small warung. Yes the reception and the kitchen area is relatively small. But I guess you will be surprised  to find that it has a number of outdoor huts for you seat with your loved ones while enjoying the gorgeous view of the rice fields while enjoying your lunch here. So great and something difficult to forget.

Beo the food. Yes it two options for you. Grilled Fished or chicken cooked in balinese style.

Although the price is a bit axpensive I think it is just valie for money. Sure for it.","You are paying for the (indeed great) location; not for the overpriced food!
A baby portion of spaghetti is IDR 57.000.
A soup (actually ‚Äúair panas‚Äù) is IDR 45.000.
The boss was not there to clarify the portion and prices.
But the location and view is great for a stop!",Very tasty food and great ambience.

Beers were available üçª","I couldn‚Äôt have anticipated what a great find this is! A roadside warung (shop) specialising in local sustainable fish (gurami) grilled in special Balinese spices over charcoals.

The ambiance of the place really captures the essence of Bali. The amazing views of the rice fields is worth the stop alone.",A beautiful view where you can sit down and really relax. Our coke and goreng pisang haha,fish dishes are excellent (and large). fantastic view. plenty of parking. small seating area but prob enough considering the rural location. service quick and kind. woulda been 5 stars but some flies were annoying but not too too bad. definitely recommended if in the area.,"If you would like to enjoy with amazingly rice terrace, just stop at Warung Made Ayu Kusuma. There is access to the beautiful landscape. The staff is so friendly and the prices of menus just average price. This place is the best one to chill and peaceful."

I'd say the vibe resembles Jatiluwih. Though not as cold, but this place is pretty much tranquil, or at least on my case when i visit it during business days in the evening. Would recommend, excellent atmosphere and view. Try the fried noodle, it's fantastic in my opinion.","Fantastic place with little shop, coffee shop and restaurant. The view is simply breathtaking. We even saw a cute fruit bat.
Highly recommended üôèüèª","This place is an absolute hidden gem. The restaurant offers a beautiful view on the rice terraces. Prices are reasonable and good was delicious.

If you like you can try different types of coffee here including the Luwak coffee.
