Decided to try and WOWWWW.. How come i just realized this place exist?.. Located at Desa Megati Tabanan, Umadhatu Waterpark is a perfect place to spend your family weekend. Large pool, good food and views and dont forget to mention, Its a child friendly place.ü•∞. Most recommended place to visit if you pas the Jalan Raya Denpasar Gilimanuk.","Positive: Best Vacation place for Family with litle children to teenager. Went we coming foam party at the pool are started which very fun activity for my little boy. The Hotel locate near farm field which will be the best view when it green on ricefields. The Food is good, the Cappuccino was Great I forgot what the brand of coffee they used. Staff also have good hospitality

Negative: room maintenance is needed, especially some spot at bathroom.","The staff are lovely and the location is great for seeing country side and authentic bali lifestyle. my daughter loved the water slides. The Cafe food was lovely
The rooms need alot of work.. the front door doesn't lock from the inside, it's just a padlock from the outside when you leave. There's no fridge to keep water and whatnot cold, there was a very strong mold smell on the mattress's and walls, cupboards falling apart, sink was gross, mold in the bathrooms.. rubbish all through the garden and court yard. all over just gross rooms. Safe didn't work
We left after the first night as we had young children and it didn't feel very safe for them.",The complex itself is great as it has a water park for activity. But the rooms need effort for maintenance. Smell damp and the cleanliness must be improved.,"New experience of my life.
I've been stay in this place with my friends for 2 days and it's really made my day."
