Way higher priced for local dishes and drinks than many other locations with similar views. I still highly recommend if cost isn‚Äôt an issue to anyone visiting.","Was here for lunch, had a sirloin steak which was good. I asked for medium - rare, and I got it like that‚Ä¶ bravo!!!

Great view into the rice fields, good atmosphere, parking space just in front. Nice interior, can highly recommend this eatery‚Ä¶!!","We loved it here!! So much so we ate here twice. The scenery is absolutely beautiful, the food is good but more importantly the staff were so friendly and welcoming, they just couldn't do enough for us. In fact, our son took such a shine to the owner he went off for a wander with him whilst we managed to eat our meal in peace. The first one in 2 weeks! I would highly recommend heading along for sunset, it's the perfect spot.","Good ice cappucino, the banana cake was nothing special in comparison to other places around. Also general the prices on menu are higher to surrounding options of bars, probably because of the good view to the rice terracees üòâ The service also took more time than average around to bring the food.","Good place to hang out with a ricefield view. Sunset was on point here. Love the atmosphere.

Staffs were nice and price was Ok.

Toilet was pretty clean, just need more tissue and trash bin there.

I didnt try many from the menu because i just had a big late lunch before i went there. But the mile crepe was good. Coffee was just ok.

But worth to try, they have amazing view."

There are different types of seating areas along the pool. They are building a super creative place where you can sit higher. It is almost finished. It is shaped like a boat and made of natural materials. The food is great, we ate tomato soup, corden bleu, club sandwich. The prices are fair. The coffee is made with a good espresso machine. To enjoy!!","The place is cozy, the food is okay.
Unfortunately there are many ants in the gazebo area.
There is a swimming pool, so children like it and feel at home.

The menu that I like here is honey grilled chicken and pizza.

The gado-gado is okay, but the seasoning is a little. So it's less satisfied to eat gado gado with a little seasoning.

The atmosphere yesterday was good, not hot and not raining. Suitable for my family.

Oh ya...
The food takes a long time to come out. So for those who want to get food quickly,, it's better to be patient. üíù","Really nice place, however they advertise pizza at 50k, written nowhere that it‚Äôs not available. So I ordered, got my pizza, average size, and was given the bill at 80k. Asked explanation but said yeah it‚Äôs not promo. + keep in my mind the service charge is a percentage of the price, so I paid even more. Thankfully it‚Äôs not a big difference, but I wish they would write that the price doesn‚Äôt apply even if you order the actual exact product advertised. Which was pepperoni pizza for me. They didn‚Äôt even offer to gift the service charge or nothing.","Great place for coffee with friends, family outing, romantic date for couple or just simply relax and work solo on your laptop.
Lots of places for that Instagram or photo memories from the pirate ship, heart bench, owl's nest, wooden swing or the giant springs.
Good selection of food and drinks available. Food and drink prices are decent. Expect to pay more than street food but you'll get better quality food here.
Nice shaded area for children to play with a few kid's toys to keep them entertained while parents can have their relaxation and romantic moments.
Very good service and plenty of smiles. Yes you can tell even though they're masked. Several areas for hand sanitizer and very clean washroom.","GREAT PLACE!  A hidden great restaurant with a great decor, terrace rice fields, and they have even a bamboo ship!  Has 2 swings over looking the rice terrace!   Great food at local prices.  Super friendly staff!"

The location provides a great opportunity to take a break in the quiet wilderness. The food offered from partner restaurant was delicious but the highlight was the friendly staff, ensuring we had an enjoyable stay.","Good getaway distance from Central Ubud. Staff is friendly and accommodating. The Villa is spacious and quiet. Rooms are clean. Beds are comfortable. Water in the shower has a bad smell to it initially, but goes away as the water warms up and runs for a minute. Nice view of the rice paddies. Good pool. Overall a great value for 10 people.","A sheer paradise to stay in Ubud Bali. Cleanliness, coperative staff , individual pool , wow , what more to expect. Would certainly recommend all to stay here for min 2 nights.","Extremely spacious, price is really worth the hotel-like amenities. Helpers provide effective assistance despite the language barrier. Place is hard to get to at first, but is forgivable as it is located in Ubud. Place is kept acceptably, but expect a few insects, you are in a jungle-like environment.","Great place to stay with family, separate compound, private pool, rooms are clean, friendly staff, great service, quiet remote place (no nearby restaurants), you can rent a bike."

The rooms are large and open. I suggest getting the top floor for the best view. Breakfast was included everyday and was tasty. The staff were very helpful and accommodating with my requests. If you need cooking equipment they will happily supply. There are scooters available for rental there as well. There are a few areas that can use improvement.... some of the furniture has termites, and some of the floor tiles were a bit loose. Also the bathroom could use a bit pf updating, like the toilet seat and mirror need to be replaced ( a bit off putting). Otherwise, I would recommend a stay at this Villa. The pool was clean and open daily. I stayed in early March and there was not construction during my 1.5 weeks there.
This location is 25 min scooter ride into Ubud Center w/o traffic. Maybe an hour walking into Ubud Center.","I was thoroughly impressed by this villa, the value for money ratio is impeccable. I was lucky enough to get a top floor with a great view of the rice fields and I believe Mount Batur, going onto the balcony was like stepping into some sort of movie paradise set. The ambience gave a little peace of mind.
Facilities were generally great and well maintained, kitchen could use a microwave and the pool is not heated and not very big(like most of Bali).
It's a little bit outside Ubud town so you'll need to factor that in plus since you're in nature you might see a few friendly ants or wasps on the balcony however not to fear as everyone minds their own business.","Located in Tegalalang, about 20min drive from Ubud center. An area of rice fields and quietness.
Cenik is very well managed with very good staff.
Everything is perfect except the hot water isn‚Äôt enough for a bath; and wifi is not reliable.","We had an amazing time at cenik villa. The staff went out of their way to make our stay comfortable, were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was so delicious! The rooms and the garden were beautiful and the entire villa just had an atmosphere of peace and relaxation.

My husband and I worked remotely from there and the wifi was stable enough for video calls.

Would highly recommend for your stay in ubud.","Nice place but bad experience !

Breakfast is good and the mother is nice of the place ‚Ä¶.

Now the truth of my experience - you must go past barking dogs and a very small ally to arrive ‚Ä¶.. not convenient and not advertised as such ! Mould / bees everywhere inside the house !
The bath is just for show as the water does not fill even 2 cm with hot water so it‚Äôs false advertising ! Construction all around and very loud noisy neighbors ! Outside my apartment can see their new construction villas ‚Ä¶

The owner while checking out got angry - he touched me without consent - harassed me, threatened me and was abusive towards me and my son ‚Ä¶ I was calling the police !

He was very rude and should not touch a woman traveling alone with her son under no circumstances ! He also was rude to try to film me without my permission !

Bad service !

Karma will get these people !"

The path to this place is unpaved, and only access by motorbike and foot.","Nestled among rice paddies north of Ubud, this cleverly designed villa offered all we could have hoped for - a garden with eggplants, peppers, cucumbers, ginger and wild spinach and a well equipped kitchen to cook it in, a beautifully lit freshwater pool that was the perfect temperature day and night, a private yoga studio and a luxurious bedroom with walk-in lockable closet (including key lock safe) and spacious bathroom complete with eco-friendly products to suit an eco-friendly design. This place is an ideal vegan friendly, eco getaway worth the visit.

For those with mobility issues, the rocks lining the pool are very slippery and there are no stairs so it‚Äôs a little dangerous to access. We were greeted by Wayan who was a fantastic host, answering all our questions and helping us with a scooter ride into Ubud. We asked for some coconut oil to fry up our garden goodies and he brought garlic and shallots to add.

He goes above and beyond and even delivered food from the Bali Nguni restaurant which is just across the road. The Bali Nguni is worth a visit - good food and lovely views.  If you‚Äôre looking for a high-end celebratory meal then we highly recommend Grill @ LUXE. Pricey but world class exceptional.

Make sure you have a little cash for food deliveries because you could easily never want to leave once you‚Äôve checked in.

There are competitors copying the design right next to the Earthship so there‚Äôs construction going on. The workers were respectful but could be seen walking on the path just outside the fence line and we noticed them at the entrance literally copying the design of the gate.  Once those units are complete, it should be quieter and hopefully this original Earthship does not suffer from the competition.

Overall, an exceptionally gorgeous location and if you‚Äôre willing to brave a good long and beautiful walk along a local trail with cafes, restaurants, and a few galleries, then you‚Äôre only an hour from Ubud otherwise a scooter taxi can get you to Ubud centre in under 20 minutes.",This is the most incredible place I have stayed in to date. I am blown away at the beauty this place and I am so grateful I had the opportunity to! This is a must visit in Ubud in my opinion!,"This place is amazing, natural beauty with the warmest hospitality. Natural pool with sutunning view.",Such a beautiful space ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®
