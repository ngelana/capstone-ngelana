The quality of the coffee was decent, delivering a satisfying pick-me-up to kickstart the day.

What truly sets Jiwan Coffee & Things apart is its charming interior design. The second level, though open-air, provides a nice ambiance, but it can get quite hot during the day. However, the real surprise was discovering the secret level 3, offering a serene view of the rice paddy fields. It's a hidden gem that adds a unique touch to the overall experience.

I decided to sample some of the food offerings as well. While the pasta was okay, it was the rice dishes that truly stood out. The flavors were delightful, and the quality of the rice was exceptional. It's always a pleasure to find a place that excels in the basics.

In terms of pricing, Jiwan Coffee & Things offers good value for money, making it a very affordable option for a meal or a coffee break. The affordability combined with the nice ambiance and decent quality of food and coffee make it a must-visit for those looking for a relaxed setting to unwind.

Overall, Jiwan Coffee & Things is a lovely place to enjoy a cup of coffee, savor a meal, and take in the peaceful surroundings. If you find yourself in Bali and in need of a cozy spot to unwind, Jiwan Coffee & Things is definitely worth checking out.","I'm in love with this place. It's like a fun house for adult and kids. A fun meeting for business as well as pleasure. Take your friends, neighbors and love ones. Food is delicious.

First i googled for a route to take me here. Then i was made curious to google what jiwan means (serene life). Then i asked for wifi password which made me open my google search AGAIN. I was here to get some job done on my laptop and i end up spending time googling through stuff unrelated. And now i feel obliged to write something here.
Love this place the minute i stepped in. It
did give me a serene vibe. Strong coffee with long lasting after taste. A hint of dark chocolate, cardamom ending with a sharp bite. Wonder what blend they are using.","Good places, good service, price a little but pricey but worth it"

Despite the photos provided in the listing, the reality of the accommodation was far from what I was expecting.

Firstly, the apartment itself was not well-maintained as the photos had led me to believe.  It was clear that the space had not been properly cleaned or maintained before our arrival.

But what really upset me was the pool. The photos showed a sparkling white-blue oasis, but in reality, the pool wall was in terrible condition. It was covered in grime and dirt, and there were even cracks in the wall

To make matters worse, there was no one at the reception the property could look fancy but turned out creepy as they don't maintenance their property, and they did not address my complaints about the apartment and pool. This made me feel like they were not concerned about providing a quality experience for their guest.

Overall, I am deeply disappointed by my experience at this Airbnb.","The only thing my wife and I did not like about the place is that the bathroom, including the shower and tub, are outside. It does however, have a beautiful pool.","If u don't mind the place is a  it run down, then is a nice place, i did enjoy my stay though",Has so much potential but not enough effort was spent on maintenance,The room was quite and near from mainroad
