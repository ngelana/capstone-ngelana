Will recommend those who are looking for an affordable and decent place!","Despite my 5-hour late check-in due to a health issue upon arriving in Bali, the staff patiently waited for me.

The affordable price of the room pleasantly surprised me, as it turned out to be spacious with a comfortable bathroom. The location is also convenient, allowing easy exploration of Canggu or Seminyak. Additionally, there are nearby amenities such as an Indomaret convenience store (within walking distance) and Pepito.","Semimpi Hotel in Bali is a fantastic place to stay if you're looking for a calm and peaceful environment. The hotel is incredibly clean and well-maintained, making it a comfortable and enjoyable place to work remotely. I stayed there for a month and it was definitely the right choice. The only issue I encountered was occasional internet connectivity problems, but the staff was quick to address and resolve any issues. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a calm and relaxing stay in Bali."

And when i wanted to sleep, the blanket totally smelly. I think from the last customer. Because it smells like an odor mix men's perfume. The room is clean, and the staff are nice. The area is also good, quite close to a restaurant or mini market. U get breakfast, there's soap, shampoo & towels. But bring ur own toothpaste & brush. There's a small kitchen on the corner that u can use.","I recently had the pleasure of staying at this fantastic apartment, and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations. The service provided was truly excellent, and the staff went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable.

From the moment I arrived, the staff welcomed me with warm smiles and made the check-in process seamless. They were always readily available to assist with any questions or requests I had throughout my stay, and their helpfulness and genuine care truly made a difference.

The apartment itself was well-maintained and beautifully designed. It was spacious, clean, and had all the amenities I needed for a pleasant stay. The comfortable bed ensured a good night's sleep, and the kitchenette was equipped with everything necessary to prepare meals.

One of the standout features of this apartment is its strategic location. Situated in a prime area, it offered easy access to various attractions, shopping centers, and public transportation. I was able to explore the city effortlessly, and the convenience of having everything within reach was a major plus.

I was thoroughly impressed with the overall experience at this apartment. The combination of exceptional service, helpful staff, and strategic location made my stay truly memorable. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient accommodation option. I will definitely be returning on my next visit to the city!","The bathroom just needs a full blown clean with chemicals, if the 50+ holes on the shower nossle only 2 worked resulting in ridiculous water pressure that shoots the hose in all directions. The soap dispenser was broken and put back together like a puzzle piece which would get knocked off the wall by the shower.

The room was clean, except for under the bed which I only realised when checking if I'd forgotten anything

Good value for money but I'm glad we only stayed for 1 night.","Considering the relatively cheap price, it's not a bad experience. They got a bonus of petite kitchen area with some utensils, pretty strategic location, and tasty breakfast delivered to our room. What's unfortunate is that the room was not in a good condition with some wall paint were peeling off, the lighting were a bit dim, the bathroom mirror were broken.

Loved them overall.","Delicious sate and tongseng kambing!! If you wanna try the authentic taste of Madura Satay, this is the right place in Canggu Area!!","Always be my favorite since few years ago (more than 4 years already).
Pak Awi and his staffs are kind and we can also get tasty Gulai Kambing here.",For a quick delicious sate kambing and gule.. this ia the place,"Expect the best satay when you are here!
Both the mutton (kambing & chicken satay were amazing as well as  gulai. Both satay came with amazing peanut sauce.
Truth to be told, I was not a fan of mutton dishes. I tend to find mutton dish too gamey in both taste and smell. This was obviously not the case in Pak Awi's stall. The satay contains a bit of organ meat and fat which  normally would taste absolutely gamey for me, even these part are not gamey at all. Delicious and relish. Pricewise, it cost us IDR 90K for 2 portion of gulai, 1 portion chicken satay, 1 portion mutton satay, 1 portion rice, 1 portion lontong (rice cake), 1 ice tea and 1 temulawak (it is like soda pop with herbs taste), given the portion we got and considering that mutton is expensive meat, it is very fairly priced and definitely money worth. Highly recommended. Please come here and taste the authentic Madura satay.
Well done pak Awi."

Fyi, the road is only for bikes (cars can not come inside the alley). So moving in was hard. The wall was not great due to the leaking marks from the bathroom. It was humid.
The good thing is they have a separate area for the kitchen. Cooking was easy!
Anyway, we moved out from this place because the owner did not want to repair the wall & they were hard to talk to. It is based on my experience so other people might have a different experience.","Good room,good vibe",,,
