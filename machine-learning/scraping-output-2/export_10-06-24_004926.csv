I think it’s because of the roofing and lack of air flow.
Next time will choose aircond room facility ( I didn’t ask whether reservation is needed or has to be a minimum occupants to dine in there) .
the price is on the average range, not cheap not expensive either. es campur for 25K, portion is big and tasty. Siomay 27K ( delicious! ) .
The only downside is the temperature of the cafe
Feels like oven. Couldn’t stay here too long , I sweated too much…","The food taste is actually good, but just avoid  ordering any menu that claimed to have ‘seafood’. You’ll just get so so little of it. And yes, I did ask if this is normal for them.","I visited this place on 4th March 2023. Hopefully, this review is still relevant when I'm posting it.

I went to Paon Pak Mo after Warung Men Sedu, hoping to eat delicious pempek here. When I arrived, I was quite surprised that the place was a cafe that I thought was cozy, not suitable for eating and leaving right away. Especially since there were more cars parked than motorcycles, I thought the price would be expensive. Since I was alone at the time and didn't bring any hangout gear, I ordered one portion of Pempek Kapal Selam.

Unexpectedly, the price was relatively cheap for a cafe, and the taste was also good. Unfortunately, the portion was small for me. So that's it, luckily I was almost full from eating pork earlier at Warung Men Sedu.

Overall, it's worth it here, especially for hanging out with friends at a cafe.","I am vegetarian and we ordered Tumis pakis and gado gado. Super beautiful food. Tumis pakis is vegetables with garlic and ginger and apices beautiful flavour and gado gado is green beans, tofu, tempeh and egg with a peanut sauce really beautiful and cheap. 100% recommended.",The food is great but please be careful if you dont like chilli food ask for less spicy. The atmosphere is very relaxing and there are different choices for seating.
