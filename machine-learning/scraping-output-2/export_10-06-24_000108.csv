The way to go to arca permandian is about 2 hours from denpasar by cars, this place is nearly by from the mother temple in bali , the is Besakih temple. Thanks for reading and anjoy the day while you are in bali.",Lovely secluded place. Was there alone. Water is refreshing. There's also a small waterfall. Can be challenging for some people to get in,"Broken road to this place, and a hard-no for car, other than small road, high traffic of trucks and no parking. The river was clean, but short.","The Tukad statue is in the Rendang Karangasem area, to enter the Tukad Arca area you don't need to pay an entrance ticket, the parking access is quite far from the location point so it takes a little time to get to this Tukad statue, but after arriving at this point the location is very displayed with beautiful scenery, as well as many activities that can be done here, namely swimming to your heart's content, taking photos, or just sitting around relaxing. In Tukad Arca there are many things that can be seen, namely the mini waterfall, Tukad Arca has very clear water, not infrequently people come to enjoy the facilities and access provided, the river water is quite cold because this location is an area that is quite cold and cool, after swimming, we can access the toilet facilities or changing rooms that have been provided, but prices start from Rp. 2,000. Besides that, in the Tukad Arca area, there are food stalls with low prices, the taste that is given is quite good according to the price that is sold.","Very clean and fresh water for swimming.
Difficult and uncomfortable road to get access though, very broken road.
Small waterfall next to the pool."
