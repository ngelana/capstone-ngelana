You could pick your most favorite flavour or buy whichever one you like most. One could see every step of  that special and most expensive coffee made from Civet cat poop there. Altogether,  a beautiful place with good scenic views and offering a great experience.","A chilled place with nice views over a woody valley. Upon entry you are greeted and shown around a garden with labelled spice plants, and shown traditional coffee roasting. You can then go to the cafe with pleasant views and try a free tasting tray with different coffees and teas before ordering a drink - there are some unusual ones to try. You'll be taken to a shop where you can buy coffees, teas and massage oils at tourist prices. Nice place for a stop but make sure you bring some anti-mosquito cream!","BAS De ATAYANA, formerly known as I Love BAS Agrotourism, is an interesting spot in Bangli, Bali. It combines a focus on nature and agriculture with some tourist attractions, making for a unique experience. Here's an honest breakdown:

The Good:
Beautiful scenery: Nestled in the hills, BAS De ATAYANA boasts stunning views of the surrounding landscape. It's a peaceful and refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of other parts of Bali.
Unique experience: Learning about coffee production, including the infamous civet poop coffee (Kopi Luwak), is a one-of-a-kind experience you won't find everywhere. Free tastings of various coffee and tea are also a nice touch.
Instagrammable Swing: ""Swing in Love"" is a popular attraction, offering breathtaking panoramic views and a perfect opportunity for photo ops.

The Meh:
Civet poop coffee: While the production process is interesting, the coffee itself is an acquired taste. Be prepared for a strong, unique flavor that might not be for everyone.
Touristy vibe: The focus on tourist attractions can take away from the genuine agrotourism experience. Expect crowds, especially around the swing.
Price: Entrance fees and prices for activities can be a bit higher compared to other similar experiences in Bali.

The Not-So-Good:
Limited activities: Aside from the swing and coffee experience, there aren't many other activities offered.

Overall:
BAS De ATAYANA can be a fun and interesting experience, especially for those seeking beautiful scenery, unique coffee experiences, and Instagram-worthy photos. However, it's important to manage expectations. Be aware of the potential crowds, the specific coffee taste, and the limited activities offered. Consider your priorities and budget to decide if it's the right fit for your Bali itinerary.",Coffee plantation and coffee processing place..they offer coffee to taste so that u can order which ever u likeâ€¦they have many varieties in coffee..we tried mocha cold coffee..they also have organic spices and perfume and attar..,A little expensive. Coffee was very good and fresh. Staff are very friendly.

Prices are super reasonable for this kind of service and quality!,"Very good food. Both grilled chicken and duck were great. We asked no spicy but it was still a little bit, but not too much.
