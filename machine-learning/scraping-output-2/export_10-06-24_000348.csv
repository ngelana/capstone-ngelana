The owners did a wonderful job making me feel at home! Sharing the fruit that grows on their beautiful land! I was even able to take some to school and share! The owners did a great job changing my sheets and mopping my floor! Always texting me on WhatsApp before entering my room and when ever I had a question they responded very quickly lol! Always greeted with smiling faces when I step outside this stay made me feel that Bali is magical! I highly recommend this House accommodations you won’t regret the feeling of being apart of the local community! Thank you for being nice and kind showing no bias and treating me the same!,"I loved this place. The hosts family is always smiling and very welcoming. If you’re looking for a place to relax and chill, then this is the best place! It’s only 20 mins away from Ubud center, so you can still go there but also be by the rice fields.

The room was very clean and the high ceilings in the room made it even better. I would stay here again next time I am in Bali!",Good place,Nice place,Good place
