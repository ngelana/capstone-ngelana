The entrance price is 25k per person, this money also goes to the farmers. Face price to me.

The people working in the ricefields are very friendly. Our kids liked it also, it takes about a hour.","Beautiful nature. Must visit! Not so touristic which is good.
Rice Field tracking around 3km

Ticket: Rp 25.000 / person
Local guide: Rp 100.000",Nice walk between rice terraces and chilli fields. 25.000 IDR/ person. We really enjoyed the silence!,"Had an absolutely amazing time walking around the rice fields. The 3km walk is super easy and the locals are some of the friendliest I've met in Bali. Few people around, some of the best views and even saw a snake."

You then have this extra layer of culture within the eco resort. From the moment we entered the report we fell in love. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, the food is fresh and tasty, the resort itself is beautiful and tranquil. Our experience here was truly peaceful and relaxing.
The little suites don‚Äôt have AC but don‚Äôt let this scare you off. If you want to immerse yourself in paradise then this place is recommended.","Stayed here for 2 nights. Lovely resort with friendly staff and a good restaurant. The views are stunning.
Rooms have no airco but a fan instead. Very eco-minded ;) . The rooms are big and clean with a large outdoor bathroom. You take your shower sort of in the jungle.","Our family of four had a beautiful stay at Darmada. It was an absolute oasis with picturesque grounds, tropical plants and fruits everywhere, lovely staff and well appointed rooms. We stayed four nights and spent a lot of time hanging out at the resort, by the pool, in and around our villa, and going for walks through the nearby rice fields. The breakfast by the river every morning was a treat, massages high quality, the restaurant was great, and some thoughtful little touches like coffee and tea waiting outside your room when you woke up made it very special. Thanks to the whole team at Darmada!",Loved this place. Villa with a private pool next the river overlooking a hill. Spik and Span. Beautiful property. Well maintained gardens. Property is a treat. Friendly staff.,"I really enjoyed staying here for 3 nights towards the end of the rainy season. Situated on a riverbank, the resort has a background palette of ambient sounds all day long. Rooms are comfortable and pretty. What also stood out for us was the lush garden and tasteful facilities for yoga and massage. The personnel was very helpful in arranging things like day trips, scooters, etc. My inner coffee addict was pleasantly surprised to find a kettle of boiling hot water and coffee outside my room each morning at 6am :)"

The restaurant looks much better than the pictures too, it was gorgeous! The service was 11/10 I could not fault a thing, the ladies really go above and beyond whilst you are dining. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, they made such an effort! üôè

For starters me and my boyfriend shared the battered prawns which were AMAZING!!! For my main I had one of the Tuna dishes, which I‚Äôm so glad I tried. The quality AND the presentation of the food was excellent. We also had some cocktails on happy hour which were such great value for money, we almost could not believe how affordable they were?! They were of such a high standard!!! Thanks to the lovely bar man ü•∞

To summarise: I could not recommend this restaurant enough, it was a place I‚Äôll never forget and would definitely return to! I wish them all the best in business ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è","Wow wow wow what an incredible restaurant! We were so happy to find this place as we had such a lovely evening here. The staff are AMAZING, so attentive, professional and seriously can‚Äôt do enough for you! The restaurant itself is beautiful. The only reason I have to give it 4 star is firstly, they unfortunately did not have the Duck dish I really wanted, but wasn‚Äôt too much of an issue as I picked the Balinese Yellow Curry. The curry itself was really nice, however there wasn‚Äôt enough chicken, too many potatoes and the vegetables were a little undercooked.

That being said, everything else here was perfect. All our cocktails were delicious. If you don‚Äôt fancy any other desserts, I highly recommend you have the Chocolate Martini, this was insane!!

Thank you to all the staff who looked after us on the evening of the 6th May 2024. We will definitely be back on our return to Sidemen in a week or so time.",We loved everything about this place. The staff are the friendliest and sweetest people. The menu had a great selection. The price is good. We came back more than once during our stay. Listed on my blog as one do the great places to eat in Sideman.,Incredible service and food to match. Could not fault anything about this place and will be returning tomorrow given it was so good. It‚Äôs such a shame we won‚Äôt be staying in Sideman long enough to try a few other places that were on my list. Highly recommend üëå,"Sintiari was an excellent server and had great English. She was so helpful and smiling!

The food was INCREDIBLE üôåüèº if you want authentic balinese dishes at a upscale place with amazing views, this is the place! We had the Balinese curry, nasi goreng, chicken fingers, and ice cream."

After visiting the more touristy areas of Bali, this guesthouse was a breath of fresh air. The view from the balcony is just beautiful, the room is clean, the shower is good. A walk through the rice fields with Yoga was one of the highlights of our trip, as was a day of exploration to waterfalls and a local museum by hiring a motorbike from the family. We ate here each night and the food was delicious. 10/10 experience!","This place is fantastic! The view over the rice terrace is lovely, the area is quiet and the room was clean. The only thing I would add would be some hand/face towels.

However, the best thing here was the food - the lady cooking here should absolutely open a restaurant!! I‚Äôve stayed in different areas of Bali and this is where I had the most delicious food.","I loved my stay at Bukit Luah! Of all the places I stayed in Bali this was by far the best. The room, the cleanliness, the breakfast, the view, everything was perfect! I would definitely come back! I highly recommend!",I chose this homestay due to the many great reviews and I must say I was not disappointed. This was my fourth visit to Sidemen and I wish I had found this sooner. It is truly incredible! The room was large and spotlessly clean and the bed so comfortable. The view is arguably the best in Sidemen. My balcony was overlooking the rice paddies and out to Mount Agung. I sat there for literal hours just watching everything. The staff are so lovely and accommodating and the breakfast was delicious. I cannot recommend this homestay highly enough. I'm already planning my next visit!,"This place was definitely a highlight of my trip! The owners are so friendly and helpful. Maddy and Kadek took great care of us and gave us good advice about local activities.
The room was clean, and the view is priceless. I would certainly come back!"

The location was amazing with an idyllic view of the fields and Sidemen. And great to be able to walk straight from the villa into the rice terraces. The staff were also lovely and really helpful - on hand for anything we needed. They gave us extra water whenever we wanted (though there was tonnes in the room each day), which sounds like a minor thing but when you‚Äôre going out exploring in the heat you want to be able to fill up your water bottles for the day ahead. The only very small downside was the hot room (no AC) and wildlife noises in the night but that is all to be expected for such a rural location.","Villa Uma Dewi Sri is a wonderful place , conveniently located right on the Sideman track, at a walking distance of Sidemen village and river through beautiful rice fields, nice surroundings. The villa itself is amazing, very comfortable and open, very well decorated, with fantastic view and pool in a lovely garden. Nina is a very welcoming and helpful host, as well as the on site staff, always taking the greatest care of our well being with kindness and discretion. Staying there is a privilege and we only can highly recommend it. We definitely hope to be back for longer asap.","Like coming Home!

It‚Äôs been the second time for us to visit Villa Uma Dewi Sri and we couldn‚Äôt be more happy. A third time will be happening for sure.
First of all, the accommodation gives you everything you could wish for and as a mega plus on top - the view!!! Don‚Äôt forget to get up early for sunset everyday and take a dip in the pool with the amazing panorama before enjoying the delicious breakfast. waking up here is the most magical moment and you will never get bored to see this spectacle over and over again!

Second is Nina and Daniel (although we have not met in person yet) and of course the staff! Whatever you need - they will try their best to make it happen somehow. Always super helpful, friendly and with a smile on their face.

We‚Äôve never felt so welcomed and truly integrated into culture and life in beautiful Sidemen.

Suksma again for everything - we can‚Äôt wait to be back!

Toni & Mitch","Beautiful place and location, right in front of a padi field! Clean rooms, and excellent staff to take care of you. Nice pool to dip in the hot afternoon. Host was extremely friendly and offered us free dinner when we gave feedback on the rubber mats in the pool that left a black stain on our feet. This was attended too immediately and the host called soon to apologise. It was very nice of her as we just gave some feedback.

Location is just nice a distance to the main Sideman, 20-30min walk to good food and spa.","Such a wonderful place! It was such a great experience. The villa and the view are so beautiful, the staff very friendly and helped us in every occasion. We booked the romantic dinner and would definitively recommend it. The food is cooked by the staff and it tasted so good! We rented also a bike, everything went very well without any problems. Sidemen is a very nice place, quiet and relaxing. We will miss it definitely and would like to come back once to the villa Uma Dewi Sri!"

The family that lives there was very sweet and hospitable. I ended up getting the teleng flower tea and chicken pad Thai. The flavor for the pad Thai was exactly what I wanted and tea has some great benefits that I had to try.

We went for lunch and had such an amazing time that we came back for dinner. It‚Äôs run by a cute family and they have cute kittens.

We had the chicken sate and sate lilit and they were both amazing, the best we had in Indonesia so far!","Beautiful food in a beautiful setting, very friendly lady who was both the chef and server for the day. The food is incredibly reasonable especially considering that this was the best food we had on our two week trip in Bali.",Had the best meal in sidemen here in this warung.
