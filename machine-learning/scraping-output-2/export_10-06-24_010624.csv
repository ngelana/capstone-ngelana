The tour was fantastic, with a guide steering the canoe through the tranquil surroundings. Although the guide didn't communicate much, it didn't detract from the experience.

The 30-minute tour was well-paced and cost-effective at 100k per person. The peaceful ambiance inside the forest allowed us to truly appreciate its beauty and tranquility.

I highly recommend visiting Mangrove Point for a calming and insightful adventure into the heart of the mangrove ecosystem. Great value and a memorable experience!","It's alright and probably OK if you want a tour, but snorkeling on your own is rather not possible, we tried, but maybe we were just unlucky with the conditions. The locals said the current and waves are too strong to get out far enough. We tried anyway, but couldn't see any fish or corals","January 2024.
Absolutely love Mangrove Point. The water is SO warm and if you swim out far enough from Agung beach club- is the best snorkelling.  (We went there by boat). Exactly the same spot the snorkelling tours take you too. Calm waters with a slight drift under current so be aware.","It is a must see/do! We rented a double kayak for 150k, went around in the forest. At some point we even got out of the kayak to swim, since if you go a bit out of the forest the water is really nice and clear. There are also lockers for your stuff, but you can also take one of the waterproof bags. We went around 3pm and it was completely empty. But watch out, because when the water level decreases it will be hard to get back to the forest, some places the water is too shallow.",I came here with the recommendation by the local tour guy.  150k per person you can enjoy the trip on the river via the mangrove.  Not a bad place to visit.

It‚Äôs beautiful to take a kayak and just go through all these small canals in the forest :) but don‚Äôt expect too much and also not a lot of animals can be seen,"Nice tour with a local boatsman. The entire tour takes about half an hour which is enough. Apart from the impressive mangrove trees and roots there‚Äôs not a whole lot to see. I expected to see some animals, birds or fish but there are only a few tiny crabs. It‚Äôs worth going though if you spend a couple of days on Lembongan. On the way to the Mangrove there a many nice places on the beach to have lunch or relax.","The only nice thing I can tell about this place is the mangrove itself. It is nice to see the trees with all the roots but now to the service part.

The sales people there don't give you a break and push you almost literally to the sale.

We were told that our ""gondoliere"" was able to speak English to explain things but when we asked the first question, all he said was...no English...so that was a lie. All other passengers of different boats told us the same.

In addition to that, the information about the flora there was only the latin name of the plant and the rest was in Indonesion...so not helpful at all.

To finish off, there was a lot of plastic in many places. Seeing the staff go through every day, a plastic sweep would be great.

To sum it up, if you don't care to get no information or if you don't mind all the plastic for 200k, then you might enjoy the ride.",Good mangrove,Such an amazing and picturesque place. Definitely must be visited.

We meet a local man who asked us if we would like a mangrove tour. We were the only people there, so we thought it was the perfect opportunity to see it without a crowd. We rode in a small flat bottom canoe while our 'tour guide' guided us around the winding waterways like we were in a Venice gondola. The water was so clear and it was so  peaceful. We then met a local woman sitting the latest seaweed haul and learnt a bit about three local trade. Week with the visit, not need to book a tour, just go straight to the end of the Mangrove Forest and strike up a deal.","Amazing !
We did the 6:30 snorkeling trip , he was the only one that we saw that does it so early
It's better because your practically alone and better chance to find mantas
Also another two stops at the most beautiful coral reefs
Also comes with a towel ,water and best time we had in the nusa islands
Most definitely recommend!","Beautiful & peaceful. Our tour only lasted 20 minutes and imo it would be best to do it by canoe instead of using a motorized boat.
Do the tour at low tide for a better understanding of the mangrove. We did it at high tide while everything is covered by water, with a guide that didn't say a word about it.
Get a good guide and ask abt the best time to do the tour. You can also do it by stand up paddle board.","This place was extremely beautiful and peaceful! The trees form a lovely canopy enclosing the mangroves and giving protection from the sun... Upon arrival you are giving the option to stand up paddle board, kayak, snorkel or have a guided tour threw the mangroves...
There are many beach bars and restaurants.
Expect to spend no more than 1-3 hours including lunch. A must see attraction of Nusa Lembongan.",Had a wonderful experiences when I & my hubby sailing around this forest. It was so peaceful and made us feel relax. We rent the boat and driver for 2 peoples only for 150. Yes we bargained from 200K to 150K. It was unforgettable experiences!

The tranquil ambiance, with the gentle breeze and calming sound of the waves, made it the perfect spot to unwind and relax.

The staff at Agung Beach Club were friendly and attentive, adding to the overall pleasant experience. While the food may not have been the absolute best, it was still enjoyable, and the prices, though not cheap, were definitely worth it for the experience and ambiance.

This place was exactly what I was looking for - a serene oasis that made me feel like I was on a secluded island with only a few other visitors around, just chilling and enjoying the moment. Agung Beach Club is a must-visit for anyone seeking a peaceful escape by the sea.",What a vibe! This place has an authentic wood fired pizza oven. I got the three cheese pizza and they served it with some great chili oil. Also got the green chicken curry. They served it in a cute clay pot and I ate every last drop it was perfect. The ocean was knee length when I went and so warm so we headed to the pool which was cool and shady. There are so many places to sit here each cooler than the last. There‚Äôs even a beautiful floating gazebo dock. So cool it‚Äôs definitely going to be my favourite place to hang out here.,"Absolutely magical spot, right on the beach! Make sure you wear your swimmers and pack a towel, as it's well worth going into the beach or the pool inside the cafe area for a dip.
There's hammocks to laze about in as well as a pontoon boat!

It was quiet when we were there, but I think it was because it was close to sunset and to see the glorious sunset it's usually at the other end of the Island.

It looked like a small family run business, which we are always happy to support. We were only stopping in quickly on our way through, but definitely would've gone back if we had more time left on the island.",Sand and sea best cocktail.

The food is delicious and the juices are fantastic. The view is beautiful and the ambience is great. All the staff are very helpful and friendly. We felt very comfortable. Thank you!","most of their snorkels are moldy, only two seemed to be okay.. this is a NO GO.
got a set for 60K with fins that were also broken and almost useless, only discovered when already in the water

regarding the answer:
we didn‚Äôt impolitely change snorkel from mask, we asked and the lady said it‚Äôs okay, of course we didn‚Äôt want to breathe in mold or have a damaged mask, of course we want two good items üòÇ and regarding people taking time to look for equipment and decide it‚Äôs not about bad intentions, it‚Äôs about considering leaving your shop and go to a better rental store‚Ä¶ you can be glad we gave you money for the trash equipment

And also, equipment to snorkel in the best conditions. There are even showers to rince yourself.
I highly recommend Bobo's Warung ! üôÇ","Wow, we had such a fabulous afternoon here!
We came here in the afternoon randomly. I had read mangrove point had very good snorkeling. Rido was amazing. He was very honest that it was low tide so the clarity might not be as good. But this exceeded our expectations immensely. The corals, starfish and fish variety were amazing. We saw a large gree sea turtle very close and it just cruised with us for a little while. We paid 100k per adult and 50k per child to have a boat take us out for 1 hour. Rido spoke good English and knew where to take us in low tide to get beautiful clear water. The water is sooo warm here too. You can walk out or swim but the current was very strong and lots of boats are whizzing past so I think taking a boat which included fins and snorkel equipment was ideal. So if you staying on nusa lembongan or one of the other nearby islands this is a great way to spend a half day. You can kayak in the mangroves and there are beers and loungers and showers for after your snorkel! Thank you rido and captain Bobo! Will recommend"

Cons:
Its only reasonably clean.

The view from the room is stunning. You literally live on the beach.
The area is very calm as it is at the very end of the street close to the Mangrove forest. Through being close to it, it is possible to take a tour through the Mangrove forest or discover it yourself with the stand-up paddle board.
From the Bungalow, you can walk into the ocean to do snorkeling. The spot is very good.
Scooter rental, planning of your Lembongan discovery and everything else is possible within the Homestay, just ask.
If somehow possible, we will be back. Thank you very much, Wayan for making our stay unforgettable. See you soon!","Great rooms directly at the beach. The staff is very friendly and helps with any issue you might have. Be aware on the island are no ATMs that accept Visa cards, only MasterCard. However there are ways to get money from a money exchange in town using your Visa card. Of you need help ask the friendly staff who will certainly assist you"

We love the food! Ordered nasi goreng ayam and it was big portion n completed with chicken satay, spring rolls, crackers and egg! Tasty and fresh. They also have homemade ice creams fruity flavors. The staff super friendly and helpful and great service. Lovely couch and relaxing view. You can see mount Batur, the all.mighty! But if you come from mushroom bay like us it will take 15-17 minutes by motorbike. Used Google maps","It's the best place when I get rest I've ever before!!
