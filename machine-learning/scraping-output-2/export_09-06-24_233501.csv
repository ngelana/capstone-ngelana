It‚Äôs feel satisfying to see that your lunch comes freshly picked from the garden, price are decent compared if these are in more touristic area. We managed to get tour and to see all the vegetables/ ingredients used in their menu.
A little charming place with equally good service",I was here for a visit and had a wonderful lunch. The Nasi Kuning  has vibrant and comforting flavors. I also really enjoyed the chocolate mousse and especially the coffee that is grown there and freshly roasted. It was excellent! Worth a try for sure.,"We came to the organic farm and cafe during our stay in the village. We were warmly welcomed by Indah and Marjan.
We shared stories with Marjan whilst Indah prepared the delicious food for us. The big tables make you feel like you are at a friend's house and you can see the fresh salad and herbs being picked from the garden for your meal. The Cafe has a very homely feel and it makes you want to stay there all day and eat their delicious food!

Everything we had at the Cafe was extremely fresh and tasty. It is really nice to see directly where your food is coming from, and with the open kitchen you can also see it being prepared!

We came to the Cafe two times during our short stay, and tried a few of the dishes. Highly recommend the pasta pesto with the fresh salad and also the spinach omellete was very tasty. For desert we tried the black rice porridge and the pancakes and these were heavenly. Also some really nice fresh juices! I think you could order anything on this menu and it will be good, but unfortunately we didn't have enough time to try it all! Hope to be back here one day and highly recommend a visit! Groetjes, Poleng family :)","This is by far my favorite cafe in Bali. They are picking the herbs freshly from the garden and the food was so delicious and original. Extremely kind people working here, had such a lovely time and regret not being able to come back for a second time.","Fantastic food, and story from Marjan on how this beautiful place began. Enjoyed talking to the girls she was teaching English too. Will visit again!"

Thank you!",A very special house in a beautiful part of Bali. Joep is a great host. Highly recommended for experiencing the rice terraces and visiting the jungle temples.,"The hosts of this place are outstanding. We rented a scouter, had a authentic dinner, worked in a communal garden, and had fun with Joep and Du! They are funny, kind, and welcoming.","A beautiful place, great coffee and good vibe",Best spot in Bali!
