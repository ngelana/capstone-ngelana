It was as absolutely amazing place. Our host andeaus was so good and so helpful and great fun. Extremely good value and a must stay if youâ€™re in the area.,"A wonderful place and awesome hosts and staff! Such a delightful place, peaceful and very relaxing.

A hidden gem!","Our taxi driver found this amazing place after we had trouble with our previous hotel and safe to say it turned out for the best. Very welcoming and friendly staff. We initially only booked for 1 night but ended up extending to 5 nights! The villas are very spacious and clean. The pool is so nice and huge. Lots of different seating areas to chill out and relax. We rented scooters and was the perfect place as a base to explore west Bali. We enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the surroundings. Massive thanks to Andreas and all the staff. We would 1000% come back.","If you find yourself in the Melaya area, Putri Kori is a great place to stay.  Lovely backpackers oasis with cozy, very clean private huts.  Wonderful outside area with a great pool.  The restaurant has a nice selection of traditional Balinese and German foods which will have you coming back for more!","Great food, great staff, great company and lovely dogs as well!"

All the space is for you and this is so relaxing. The two staff, Putu and Yogi are simply amazing and brought our trip to another level and planned everything for us.
And they cook well :)
The place is ideally located to go to Ijen or snorkeling / diving.
If you like tranquility, a quiet place, the sea and a beautiful garden, do not hesitate.","Weâ€˜ve had an amazing time at Suara Glamping and are sad we had to leave again. Putu and Yogi are excellent hosts, provided everything we needed. We enjoyed their company and Putus excellent cooking. Best food weâ€™ve had in Bali so far. The property is beautiful with spacious tents with private bathroom right at the beach. Special greetings go out to the dog we called â€žBell ðŸ””â€œ that spent a few days with us and slept outside our tent at night :-) if you are looking to get away from crowds and noisy streets, this is the place to be. We didnâ€˜t see anything but the ocean, our friends Putu and Yogi and the dog all week.","Let me tell you about this dreamy place: the sweet gentle breeze, the amazing beach, the gorgeous garden, the beautiful tents, and the lovely hosts!! It was our perfect paradise stay. In addition to all this bliss, the food that they cooked for us everyday was outstanding. Highly recommended!! We canâ€™t wait to go back.","Enjoy my stay a lot in this place. Love everything about it. The location, in front of the beach's perfect, the interior design's well thought and decorated exquisitely. If you're looking for tranquility and peacefulness, this is the place. But what I love most's the friendliness & kindness of Putu & Yogi. In addition they cook fabulous food!!! I 100% recommend this place!!!",Verry good place and nice see brezz

Great cook Sri will make your stay memorable with her amazing creations.
The garden is beautiful and the sound of the waves is soothing.","The perfect place to visit when you want to get away from it all. At the Eco Beach House you get a whole house to yourself, plus 3 wonderful staff to look after you, with no other guests. The open plan house is beautiful and comfortable, with lots of choices for comfy lounging spots, plus a few more outside. The downstairs bathroom is huge with a great shower. The food is delicious, prepared fresh to order every day. The staff invited us to participate in local ceremonies, but also left us alone for most of the time - just the right amount of attentiveness. The beach has lots of rubbish washing up, but the staff so their best to clean up and the water is beautiful band clear, lovely for swimming. This isn't a hotel, and it's not in a touristy area so there aren't really other spots for food or drinks in walking distance. So if you want to get away from the crowds this is the place.","A lovely relaxing retreat. Clean and nice. The owners and staff are very helpful and the food is made fresh each day and tastes amazing.
The house fits in with its environment and is nice to relax there and watch the wildlife. The beach is sandy and quiet with great views of the Java volcanoes. It is a shame that there is so much plastic litter washed up at the top of the beach, but you can't have everything.",The beach house is an incredible place to stay - the house is just plain gorgeous and the location is isolated but also not far from lots of amenities. You get the beach to yourself and the volcano view is spectacular. And Ibu Sriâ€™s home cooked Balinese food is beyond delicious!  Highly recommended!,"Iâ€™ve just spend the most relaxing few days at the Bali Eco Beach House. I couldnâ€™t have asked for a more perfect location. The house itself had everything I needed and more.  The design and setting sits perfectly on the beach front with the swimming pool nestled between the house and the beach. The little kitchen and lovely Ibu provided me with my delicious meals, juices and snacks. I enjoyed soaking in the big bath listening to the waves lap and the sounds of nature. One  of my favourite times was sitting on the beach watching the sunset. I highly recommend the Bali Eco Beach House,  and Iâ€™ll definitely be back."
