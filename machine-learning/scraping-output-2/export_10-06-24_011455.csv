The staff is super friendly and polite, love how quick witted they are as well. The hotel facilities are great, the rooftop is the most enjoyable place to hang. Leaking in the toilet is a bit disturbing, but other than that everything is fine. Worth the stay!

P.S. off-shift staff are a different kind of staff though lol, so don‚Äôt be surprised","Sharing my stay experience at this hotel:
1. Arrived 1ish pm and informed that room not ready (its ok since check in time is 2pm). However, they allocated room number 3xx for me and my family. I signed a form for that then we went out for lunch.
2. Arrived back at hotel around 5pm. Receptionist informed us room will be available in 10mins. Waited more than 10mins, asking many times, no confirmation. After we waited and kept complaining at the front desk, room available at 7pm.

What make things worst: not a single sorry from hotel staff, not even once ! They told us why dont we waited, why came to hotel very late, and some other non-sense statement.
The the day after we asked for 2hrs late check out which they rejected and only allowed us till 1pm ( regardless we enter the room 5hrs late)

At room, we asked for one extra towel, i repeat ONE piece of towel, they rejected since they said hotel policy not allowing extra towel.

At breakfast, this lady who write down our name and room number, no greeting no smiling at all.

What an unique experience, which i dont want to repeat :)","All staffs are nice, especially mita ( I hope I remember her name correctly).
Stayed in room that air on is not so cold, and even you cranked up the thermostat.
Reported to Mira at receptionist and she help me to send technician to checked the unit and later gave me new room.
Location wise, right in middle of bypass, not so convenience if you don‚Äôt have car or rented bike/vehicle, sometimes online transportation could be hard to get.
Room is not as advertised on website, but overall I‚Äôm happy with the condition, cleanliness and facilities.
Food wise; it‚Äôs good enough for me.","Mixed thoughts on this Hotel.Booked a non smoking deluxe room for 3 people on Arrival was given a twin room facing a wall, which smelt  very smoked. They were very nice in moving us to another room, but when I asked about the bed for the third person was told I had to make an additional payment as it was not showing up on the confirmation. The bathroom and shower had splatters of black paint everywhere, looks very unprofessional and the room had a lot of dust in obvious places.The reception AC is always off , I don‚Äôt why they choose to make guests suffer like that. The star of the this hotel is the roof top pools , although the day beds needed some washing .","Good things first :-
- Staff were the best part. They were very hard working and accommodating. Always greeted with a big smile.

- it wasn't overly expensive and was value for money.
- food was good ( except breakfast buffet, extremely limited)

Not so great things :-

The photos on the websites are deceiving. The rooms are tiny, small bathroom and toilets.
The location isn't close to anything. You will have to travel using a cab or a scooter.
The gym is super tiny."

We ordered a Mie Gacoen Level 1, which is no different from a Mie Hompimpa, but with Kicap Manis, a type of indonesian black sweet Soya sauce. Personally, I prefer the Gacoen one, and if you'd like to taste more of the flavour of the sambal, then Hompimpa is good. You can choose a varying level of spice. And if you can't take spic Mie Suit has no spice at all. All comes with Pangsit, which is fried dumplings that have chicken in it. I was more surprised at how chewy the noodles are. It was close to Ramen, La Mian, or Bak Mi, actually!

Also there were only 2 other tables occupied so it wasn't like the kitchen was busy. When asked they said it is a homemade lava cake....,"""Chatwood""

Jimbaran.  On Jl. Bypas Bali Street, a busy street almost like a highway, stood Chatwood, a Bakery, Cakeshop, Coffee Eatery and Pizzeria, a place that radiates innovation and charm.  Its fa√ßade is adorned with exuberant plants, inviting passersby to enter an oasis of flavors and aromas.

Upon crossing the threshold of Chatwood, visitors are greeted by very friendly employees, a cozy atmosphere, where air conditioning provides comfort, and live music fills the space with immersive melodies.  Both inside and on the spacious terrace, the exquisite decoration and abundant vegetation create a unique atmosphere, perfect for enjoying a memorable dining experience.

However, after the first positive impression, we discovered a disappointing truth.  Despite the excellence of the place, there is a notable discrepancy between what was promised on the Menu and what is available.  40% of the dishes requested were simply not available.

This discrepancy generates frustration and disappointment among customers, who long to fully enjoy the culinary variety offered by Chatwood.  It was difficult to understand how an establishment so carefully designed and with such an attractive gastronomic proposal could not meet the basic expectations of availability of its dishes.

As in any story, this situation offers an invaluable lesson.  Chatwood, despite his brilliance, teaches that consistency and reliability are essential in the world of restoration.  No matter how exquisite the decor or attractive the menu, the customer experience is tarnished when promises are not kept.

Through this experience, Chatwood has the opportunity to grow and improve.  Recognizing your limitations and working to optimize your sourcing and inventory management processes would be key to regaining the trust of your customers and ensuring your continued success in the competitive gastronomic world.

In conclusion, Chatwood's story reminds us that, on the journey toward excellence, every obstacle is an opportunity to learn and grow.  With determination and commitment, any challenge can become a springboard to lasting success.","We recently visited and LOVED it. Gorgeous decor, friendly staff, delish food and amazing cocktails.

Highly recommend the Australian short rib and crispy duck. Also the cosmo cocktail.","A place with good aesthetics but average food from what I tried. They really have a wide selection of food starting from Indonesian to Western food. I tried their pork ribs, steak, and Nasi goreng. All of them were just average‚Ä¶ there are better ribs in the city, the steak was not as juicy and tender, the Nasi goreng was actually not really good.

The atmosphere and the ambience on the other hand is very good and looks aesthetic. The plants, colors of the wall, layout of the restaurant, etc made a really good atmosphere in the restaurant.

I am not sure if the place is that worth it to visit unless you are really looking for the aesthetic of a restaurant."

PLACE : Good. SERVICE : Good. PRICE : Fair.

Found this restaurant from Social Media.

The Babi Guling Sultan was very delicious, lucky me I still had the last portion. What I most like was the giant crispy skin (it was perfect).

This restaurant‚Äôs access is very easy. I took indoor seat because when I arrived Bali was really hot & humid.

While I arrive many online food drivers in here, I think this reataurant is very famous.

My opinion the price was fair, same with others similiar resaurant. Note : price is different for the Special, its Babi Guling Sultan.

I reccommend this place for quick-eater, couple, small group and family.","The babi guling nasi campur was really good that I had to come here two days in a row. I had to leave Bali after otherwise it would have been 3 days in a row!

I ordered the babi guling special which came with soup and more 'lauk' (portions of meat, etc). The skin was crisp, and meat was juicy tender. The satay babi was also bursting with flavour, balanced with the right ratio of meat and fat which provided the extra 'ooomph' umami.

The meat and satay were so satisfying that I even ordered an extra portion to be shared. Too bad they ran out of skin, or I would have ordered more.

Definitely worth to make the trip here. The shop is located on the main arterial road so parking is impossible. Take a Grab car from Jimbaran or Nusa Dua if you are in the area. Go early lest they run out of skin.

Nasi Babi guling special was IDR35,000, while a side of meat was an extra IDR50,000. Additional satay was IDR4,000 per stick. Well worth the money.

This place would be my firm 2nd favourite nasi babi guling in Nusa Dua area, second only to Dobil. The plus point for doublesix was that they open till 9pm (earlier if sold out) and have really comfy air-conditioned seating.

My regret was that I didn't have a chance to try their Nasi Babi Guling Sultan version which comes with a giant piece of skin as it was sold out. Next time for sure.","I brought my family to try babi guling. This restaurant is very clean and have a lot of choices especially soft drinks and coffee in menu so good for tourist who wants to try babi guling for the first time. Price looks a bit expensive for such a local food. Babi guling itself is just normal pork meat, I'm not sure it is nice or not but anyway satisfied to have new experience.Staff are friendly and serve fast, nice.","A very clean place to enjoy babi guling, the food is more of a modern take of the babi guling.. but still has the distinct flavorful spicy kick of the dish though less compared to a more traditional version","The shop is clean and less crowded at the time I arrived. We ordered nasi babi guling biasa and special, taste good, love the sate babi as well. Price is acceptable."

They also have some food, but I haven‚Äôt chance to try it. Small and clean cafe, even good for freelancers. Thanks to staff!üíó","I love durian but it‚Äôs hard to buy a whole or even half of the fruit to eat it by myself. I wondered why Bali does not have unique desserts made with durian, then my prayers were answered when I randomly found Durian Darlings! They have so many creations here, I wanted to try them all but I had a big lunch and could only start with 2 for now. The Signature Pancake was so yummy, the crepe exterior is very thin and airy, and the fresh durian filling is very delicious. I also tried the Es Serut Durian Darlings, though I did ask them to omit red beans since I don‚Äôt like it (which makes me a terrible Korean üôä). It was so good and refreshing on a hot day, and I really enjoyed all of the different chewy jellies inside the coconut milk. The durian on top of the shaved ice was more mild than the pancake, so might be a good try for someone who is new to durian. Service was great and love the AC indoors. I want to come here every day while I am in Bali!","An air conditioned place that sells durian meals and desserts.
The durian pancake is worth a try. We also tried their Es SERUT shaved ice Mung bean with durian. It was good but weirdly they added salt to both their ice cream and Mung bean.","They would help you pack the takeaway nicely and decently.
The milkshake and pancake are perfect and we enjoyed it a lot!"

The service is friendly, and although the place isn't big, it's cozy with both indoor and outdoor seating areas. There's a wide variety on the menu, and if you're lucky, you might meet the cat that likes to drop by this cafe.

Thank you! üò∏","We got stuck in kuta for a week while we were going through the visa extension process so Rena's became our daily brunch! We love it here, super cute, small and cozy cafe with many options for breakfast, lunch and dessert! Everything was delicious and reasonably priced.","A tiny little place hidden in Taman Griyah Jimbaran. I had chicken with nasi goreng, and a latte. The meal was much larger than expected from a small coffee shop. The chicken was huge. The coffee lattee was a bit strong for my taste but the overall experience was wonderful and cheap!! Please go check it out if you are in the area. Oh and the cat is super cute! More @zsoltzsemba","One of my favorite cafes in the area. Friendly staffs, good coffee and good food. Must try their tropical smoothie bowl if you want something refreshing and filling at the same time. Love their banana peanut butter crepes, try it if you want something sweet. Recommended cafe!","Amazing vibe! Quite space, no traffic. Green and light. Very cozy.
The pearl is a vinyl Turntable! You can try and enjoy the sound!
Very welcoming staff.
Coffee is amazing! Java, Sumatra and Bali blend.
Tableware is very cute!
Music in cafe is super comfortable.
Food is good but I‚Äôd like to say the sausage is full of sugar which is common in Bali. Ketchup and beans also over sweet. Beans might be just clean cooked.
I‚Äôll come back for sure!
Especially if they have vinyl fun nights!"

Thick, creamy, full of meat, speechless. They also have Beef Satay, will try it next time for sure. I knew this place from my friend.","The restaurant had a welcoming and clean atmosphere. The staff were friendly and provided quick service. We ordered chicken satay, lamb satay, and lamb gulai. The chicken satay was tender and flavorful, the lamb satay was perfectly grilled, and the lamb gulai was rich and savory. Prices were reasonable for the quality of the food. Overall, a great dining experience. Would rate 4.5 out of 5 stars. Highly recommended!","Each portion was 10 skewers, very tasty. Good sauce. Nice service. Easy and simple menu to read. No AC, good fans.","Sate Barokah is one of the best Satay place. They serve all meat. The gulai is also good seasoned. They‚Äôre generous with the portion. They have juice stall as well. The price is affordable, IDR 100k/2 pax. Place is spacious and clean. They receive online payments. Sate Barokah is available online","There are hundreds of reviews about this place and I am about to join in. These pictures explained how I took eating in this place seriously. I think I don‚Äôt need to give a long explanatory about it. As a conclusion, I almost always left this place full. Favorite dish is the Gulai.
The only problem most probably is the limited spot for parking."

The bread and coffee so delicious to pass","Not really, In front of the street, I saw a shop containing various delicious sweets, but inside I was shocked. In all honesty, the sweets are mediocre."
