When we walked in the first thing they said you cant drink your water here, of course that is common sense, but i am not leaving it on the scooter in the hot sun. We missed a welcoming good morning. The funny thing is that we saw others having their own drink. We ordered 3 dishes and 2 drinks. The plan was to order more dishes but because of the service we left it with only 3. Before we where able to finish reading the menu they already came soon to take our order, it felt like they where rushing us.
The place itself has a nice view.
The food is decent, mac and cheese was a small portion. The bagel with cream cheese had a tiny bit of cream cheese, when asked for a normal amount they wanted to charge extra.
The smoothie bowl had a nice taste, a bit too watery but taste was nice!
Because of the lack of good service we are not coming back and will continue for food at another place.",Didn't regret coming here for french toast! One of the best ü•π it was so good and the flavor of every ingredient complements each other. The place was super chill and it was so relaxing!

Everything supernice, delicious, vegan milk options available with both oat and almond. No decaf, but I treated myself with a latte anyway and it was delicious.
They have AC.
The internet was a bit too slow to work for me, but I could see other working with computers at this place. Maybe depends on how much speed you require.","Good cafe with air conditioned room as well as outdoor area overlooking beautiful rice fields at the back. The food portion is generous and the prices are not too high. Good wifi connection and there are several power plugs within reach, even at the outdoor area.","Wonderful Service and Beautiful views!
I spent the entire day here doing some work on the computer. The wi-fi is strong. They have separate routers for the indoor and outdoor areas. The ambiance is relaxing, I enjoyed their choice of music (surprisingly R&B), and their staff provided us with 5 star service. Their rice field is dry right now so it wasn‚Äôt anything amazing to look at. Still, I enjoyed sitting outside looking at the open brown field. They have indoor seating as well with air conditioners. I tried both breakfast and dinner. The food is standard but nothing to rave about. Overall, I would return!"

The service is top notch - all of the staff members we encountered were so kind and accommodating, and really care about making the guests feel at home. The pool was clean and cool and refreshing for hot days, and the breakfast was fantastic with a rotating menu. The AC worked great and the room was spacious. Free shuttles at various times of the day to get you to Ubud center, so we never felt too far out. I would definitely stay here again.","What a great place to relax and unwind!! Such a beautiful way to connect with nature with their well kept, lush garden and an exceptional service from Ayu, Pery and the rest of the Aryaswara team!
The only feedback I can think for future improvement, is the response to any queries be provided promptly, and stock be replenished when rooms get cleaned.
The complimentary shuttle service was ideal and hopefully can be extended to a later collection time ie. 9pm to 10pm,  allowing more time for those who would like to roam around Ubud Centre in the evening.

I ordered three wings and it cost about 1k rupiah, I think.  The combos come with chicken, rice and a drink. But I didn‚Äôt want any rice. I didn‚Äôt see options for other sides like fries.

Young people working behind the counter were friendly. The cashiers spoke English. And the place was filled with plenty of local folks, which is always a good sign.

The chicken was crispy on the outside, well seasoned and not over cooked on the inside. he reminded me of a Popeye‚Äôs or KFC chain. It was a taste of home away from home.

They gave us packets of ketchup to put on it to go. They had regular and spicy ketchup.","Service was so terrible, none of them spoke English, nor were they friendly. They just like being rude i believe (especially the skinny girl with hijab)

Best part is their morning breakfast don‚Äôt miss out on that.
Highly recommended for big groups as well.","Dede Cottage Ubud is a charming establishment that perfectly captures the essence of Ubud's laid-back atmosphere.

The staff is really nice, we got bikes from the owner's brother for an amazing price and really new ones! The best bikes we got so far in Bali.
Definitely recommended","We stayed at Dede cottage for about 4-5 nights. At first sight the place is tidy and well kept. The garden is beautiful and it‚Äôs pretty quiet.

The staff is kind and always wants to help out.

Breakfast in nothing special unfortunately and is always cold and chewy when arrived even if that claim they just cooked it..

The room is fine, nothing special. Very good bed and hot shower.
Although sink was not working well.
Toilet is really disgusting and needs to be updated. The tv was placed in a strange place and was very inconvenient to watch.

We wanted to extend our visit 2 nights and we felt really bad treated at this point and it even felt like a scam.

We asked staff 1 for extension and price. He says 225 IDR for 1 night even though we paid 180 through agoda. So we asked him if he could talk to the manager about price. He says that he will come back tomorrow and it is 2-3 rooms available for that period.

Next day another staff was working, we asked him about this and  if the other staff had talked to manager yet. He said we should wait one more day, but price is now 250/night.

Next day (the day before we need to extend or checkout) we ask again. This staff now says the price is 300 and nobody has yet asked the manager. And it‚Äôs now 300 because only 1 room left.. even though it was 3 left when we asked‚Ä¶
He calls manager and manager says 350/night!!!!!

I get pretty angry at this point and explains the situation, they don‚Äôt care and don‚Äôt care about their guest. So the price has gone from 225 to 250 to 300 to 350.

We decided to check out after feeling scammed and used by the staff. We have stayed on ALOT of hotels and never been used liked this.

An overall okay stay now is ruined and our memory of dede cottage, will forever be the last part of my review. Too bad. It has good potential otherwise."

Good value IDR 60k (AUD $6) for lunch (June 2023). A good option if you want something more authentic than the tourist cafes of Ubud.","We have not been here for a number of years as the prices had gotten expensive due to many westerners going here. Having been out shopping in the neighbourhood and feeling a bit hungry we decided to call in.

The prices were not readily available on the menu which is a bit of a concern as they could potentially charge you any amount.

We tend to eat a lot of chicken so we order more than what would probably be a normal meal. Having said that we tend to skip the rice or just share some. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce was sweet and spicy as per the menu. The additional sambal is great if you like more of a kick.

As well as the chicken we also ordered a serve of chips (kentang goreng), the serve is small but they were hot and fresh. The only thing missing was chicken salt.

If the prices remain reasonable we would be likely to return.","I came here for enjoy the dinner. Officially the food (ayam goreng & ayama bakar) was nice, and delicious except the sayur plecing the taste little bit less. Try to order ikan but it was run out, Balinese sambal is the best üëç.

I ordered takeout and it was still crunchy when I ate at home.,"Best of the best takoyaki, affordable!!
Love itü•∞","My favourite takoyaki in the ubud! I always order the baby octopus takoyaki. The batter taste really good, especially when it goes with baby octopus. Their sauce and the topping match perfectly with the takoyaki. The price also cheap, its only 40k for 8 baby octopus takoyaki and aroun 12-15k for the regular takoyaki.","I love their takoyaki. Super cheap and fast.
Must try",its like a crep with sausage or oktopusy inside. for me too hot and no tasty
