The staff were super friendly, always greeting us with a hello and putting in the effort to make our kids smile.

Location was superb! Great beachfront views and amazing sunsets.

We enjoyed both pools. When the beachfront pool got a bit busy with outside visitors, the quieter back pool was perfect for the kids.

The food, drinks and cocktails we ordered were üëåüèº. Tuna poke bowl and funghi pizza were delicious!

The vibe of the whole place with the lush greenery, styling and upbeat music is highly infectious! Our last night having sunset drinks upstairs was perfect.

Room was comfortable and easily accommodated our family. Daily complimentary water bottles were greatly appreciated!
Just some feedback, our tap in room #7 was wobbly and too close to the sink edge making it tricky at times with young kids and the shower grout could use a deep scrub (only minor issues that didn't dampen our stay!).

Overall great stay for our first time on Lembongan Island!!","Nice setting. Food was very average, prices were very high for Lembongan, and service was non existent. We were there for 3 hours and not once were we asked if we‚Äôd like to order food or drink. Had to keep going up to the counter to order. When we ready to leave I asked if they could call us a taxi and they informed me that they charge 50% extra just to call a taxi. There‚Äôs many better options on the island, this place seems to price gouge.","Perfect stay in a perfect spot.  Staff were simply wonderful and very attentive.
The vibe is chill, with some funky lounge beats.  Some reviews say music is very loud - no issue for us as a family.  Very pleasant relaxing tunes.  Could not hear from our room.  This is not Nusa Lembongan‚Äôs Finns beach club!
Food was great, pricier than other places we stayed on the mainland, and available locally elsewhere, but we weren‚Äôt moving from the Ohana‚Äôs atmosphere and staff were amazing.
Thanks for a great stay - wish we had longer on the island - will be back soon!","Amazing food, staff and facility.

We were worried where we would have spent a relaxing lunch time and we came across their beach club.
We had wonderful, authentic pizza (we are Italian!) and their burgers and Indonesian salads were superb.
We could have a drink in the pool, in the shadow making it the perfect spot where we could relax without sunburning.
Also chilling playing cards under the palms was a plus!","We stayed at Ohanas for a couple of night in a family suite and had a fantastic time. Great room overlooking the pool. Good sized bathroom and close to the sea.

Good central location and amazing ambience throughout the property.

The restaurant was good, but a bit pricey when you have many other options nearby. Breakfast was good but service was a little slow.

The sea looked good, but quite a lot of sharp coral and a few boats parked up, so not the best to swim in.

Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."

My long black was very mediocre. I love my coffee.

Three times I asked for my scrambled eggs to be well done. They came runny so I returned them to be cooked well done.

As my order was a few cents under their 100,000 rp minimum for cards, they charged me an extra 3% for using my DEBIT card.

Overall not impressed. I doubt if I'll return.","Lovely place which serves both delicious food with many vegan and vegetarian options as well as supporting good initiatives like zero waste. We also liked their home made coconut cream which was on the coconutty milkshake. We went both for lunch and breakfast and both times the food was good and tasty. Staff is friendly, they don‚Äôt charge extra when using creditcard. Also great that they have free water available.","Loved this place :) had the corn fritters and hand cut fries for a quick snack - both were sensational. Lovely servers. Relaxed atmosphere - you could choose to lay in the deck chairs on the edge of the beach or at a table inside or outside. I think I paid around 150k (~$15nzd) for the two dishes, a sprite and a dessert."

Food is delicious!!!! Staff is so friendly. Highly recommend the big breakfast and the smoothie bowls and probably anything they have!,"We came here twice! Friendly staff and interesting menu choices. Be warned that the drinks here usually have some kinda healthy twist(ginger, parsley etc). We LOVED the ceviche. We tried and enjoyed their new dish: Avocado Bacon sandwich(gluten free bread). I really liked that the staff came over afterwards to ask for written feedback on the dish. We also really loved the nachos. Ended up bringing it back to our Inn to eat because we were too full.

We also tried the Pad Thai, indo fishcakes(was expecting ampeh but it wasnt). They were not bad.

If we are ever back in Lemongan, we will definitely drop by Ginger & Jamu ‚ò∫Ô∏è","We've been here twice.  breakfast menu, coffee, jammu - great.  The staff is friendly and the food is prepared quickly.  One regret we weren't here for a lunch.  I'm sure it would be delicious as well.

Expensive service fee automatically charged, but no service? Maybe this should be removed so the staff actually make an effort to offer better service...","Be careful for sensitive people. Many many insects. Way more than what we saw in Ubud of other parts of Bali and Lombok. I don‚Äôt know exactly if it is the same all around or just in Indiana Kenanga.

The people are amazing. Very smily kind and professional. The restaurant is not a french restaurant as said. Their prices are excessively high comparing to the plates they serve.

Cool fact is that there‚Äôs this local fish restaurant at a 5 min walk. Go left when in the main street","Wow.... We've been to Bali 14 times and thos was the first visit to Nusa Lombogan.
The Island is free of harassing hawkers, Aussie Hogan's, drunken and loud fools, and is so peaceful, It is truly our new go to place for a 100% peaceful, forget the World trip.

Indiana Kenangan (Villa accommodation) is set between the main street in the North West of the island, backs in to the beach where the beautiful sea look restaurant will both surprise and impress you. It's probably the most expensive place to.stay innthe island and you can get better accommodation nearby for 3 night for the price of one at this place. Way too expensive for what it promises. If you like.you TV, forget this place as there is no TV in the rooms, (which is great) and there's no milk or creama in the rooms, but it is readily available from a terrific little mini mart on the left of the entrance next to the villas. Very nice place but if they dropped their prices by 2/3rds in comparison to nearby places and those in other beachside areas of the island, that would be about the right price.","When we arrived here we were immediately blown away by the location. It really is excellent

However there are some key details which dragged the experience down and dampened the stay here‚Äôs

1- BREAKFAST. The additional charge breakfast is poor, and not worth it. It is on a VERY restricted basic menu. It is not worth the additional 150k charge, you can find much better just next door in several places. They actually tried to charge me for a 2nd cup of coffee and juice. I refused to pay for this and was not charged.

I asked for our money returned and no hard feelings. However the manager refused and said to deal directly with our booking agent. Disappointing.

2-price. I would not say it‚Äôs good value for money here. Location is Excellent however drinks and food are on the expensive side and there is a further 10% charge added for service.

3-Service. This was poor. There is an abundance of staff at the resort of which are not proactive and seem to just hang in groups out of sight of guests who are sunbathing at the front of the restaurant.

4-rooms, very spacious, which was great. The room AC however is not suitable for the size of the room so is not effective. There was never any hot water. Coupled with there being lots of mosquitos and no management of this by the hotel in terms of fumigation.

5-premises. For what is a more premium location for the island the premises needs some tlc. The pool was dirty and not cleaned through the day which was required to to the location of trees around  the pool and insects.

6. On exit I was not asked by the receptionist how my stay was I was just asked to pay the bill.

As noted location really is excellent and with local bars and restaurants all in local walking distances. I would not however stay here again or recommend following our overall experience.",Had a three night stay here. It was a luxury boutique suite with a secluded private garden. The amenities were fantastic with our favourite part being the truffle fries and the included breakfast at the beachfront restaurant as well as the spa and pools. Our travel to and from the island was all organised through the hotel and made it seamless and stress free.

Both were really nice. I usually eat a bit more, so I was able to order extra eggs too, which is great. A normal meal and a coffee would cost you under 140k, which isn't bad at all.","We had their pizza and lasagne, the pizza had a thin crust that was crispy and delicious. The cheesy topping might be a bit too much for some people who prefer a lighter cheese ratio on their pizza
The layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheese in the lasagne were well balanced, and had good flavour.

The overall dining experience at Lemongrass was great. The staff was friendly we enjoyed the atmosphere

The prices were reasonable too.","Meals were pretty damn good very tasty and beautiful presentation.
Happy hour we had buy 1 cocktail get one free and they were quite strong but still very nice.
Live music was great and service was excellent. Great night had by all.","The atmosphere was cheery and light. The staff greeted me quickly and allowed me to choose any seat I wanted. I ordered a cleansing smoothy and  cheesy,  chicken, and bacon dish that was out of this world. VERY delicious food. I can recommend this establishment highly.","We've walked past a few times and have seen and heard the live music, which always draws a great crowd.

This is a great resort.
Great location, great pool and the villas with private pools are fantastic.
There are definitely some maintenance issues with the decking around the main pool area.
The gardens are beautifully maintained and cleaned every day and throughout the day.
The beer! It wasn't cold and it was expensive, which is a shame. We would've probably bought beer at the resort if it was cold and just accepted the price as it's an in resort purchase and really convenient.
Other drinks at the bar were expensive and their happy hour dropped the scam 21% service tax. Not really much of a happy hour.
The restaurant was unfortunately, pathetic. Lots of staff waiting around and not actually knowing what to do. I don't believe this reflects on the staff as much as it does on the management.
I had the same thing occur to me as Swifto, someone removing my plate before I'd actually finished eating my breakfast!
The buffet breakfast was just adequate. Compared to other resorts it doesn't rate. There's a real feeling of a miserly approach to the buffet offerings. Half to quarter filled bain maries that are not always topped up as they frequently ran out of whatever was inside!
We had one dinner on a seafood BBQ night and unfortunately it was a debacle. So much so that we left the restaurant and ate dinner outside.
This is a resort that misses the one percenters.
There is a real opportunity to make this a great resort with experienced management and leadership.
The abundant staff were all very friendly and attentive , but lacked direction and experience.
I hope this resort takes on some of the feedback provided by it's guests.","While following the beach road, I found it and settled on a sunbed.

I ordered mango juice, margarita pizza, and fruit, and it was fine. It was 320k in total.

This is a great location for sunset viewing.

The pool is not available unless you are a guest.","Great location, easy opportunity to make it an awesome destination.

Ok so this is a great place to stay. Yes we would come back. Location is great. On the beach. Good restaurants, shops, bars, within easy walking distance. We travelled the whole island and this was the best area from that perspective.

We had a villa with a private pool. The villa was very nice inside. Well appointed. Comfy bed. Modern TV which you can cast to or sign in to. WiFi is good. Everything else we needed was there. Pool was good size. Regularly maintained.

Overall the staff were polite and attentive. Gardens and pool areas are clean, tidy, well tended and look great.

So it‚Äôs a good place to come to. But opportunities exist for this resort.

A lot of the decking (villa external and public pool area) is loose or bowed and would be considered unsafe in areas.

Unfortunately the restaurant just doesn‚Äôt meet the expectations set by its surroundings. We had breakfast included. There were lots of staff but nobody seemed to own the service, most were just stood around on their phones. There was plenty they could have been doing to make a difference. Seems like they lacked direction or experienced supervision and some equipment. Things management should be looking in to supporting their staff with!

The food offering was of below average quality. The sliced fruit was left uncovered for hours and was a haven for flies. Flies also massed on vacant tables which indicated poor cleaning. Staff didn‚Äôt seem troubled by that. There is an omelette station which was decent. But pastries were left in an overheated ‚Äúpie warmer cabinet‚Äù which just baked them to a crisp. There were a good range of buffet options overall. Including fresh bread. It just wasn‚Äôt well presented or supported by the staff or the equipment.

Coffee.  There is barista coffee. There is obviously no barista (at breakfast - we didn‚Äôt try it again after breakfast). The coffee was weak and bitter. It occasionally had some coffee art on it (which is secondary to flavour anyway IMO). Didn‚Äôt see or hear the coffee grinder going. Never heard the knock of the portafilter being emptied. You get a free barista coffee with breakfast, which is just as well because I wouldn‚Äôt pay for it based on what we had! This is probably about training and is a great opportunity for support for the team as well as commercially.

One thing the restaurant staff did do quickly was take your plate. On a couple of occasions they were clearing my actual breakfast plate as I had the toast in my hand. Always very polite. But made us feel like they wanted the table back which clearly they didn‚Äôt need. It took the leisure out of the leisurely breakfast, which given the lovely beachside location was such a pity. It‚Äôs such shame because sitting in that location enjoying (and happily buying) a nice coffee or two to relax with would be a great offer.

Afternoon Tea was offered as an included option for us. We stayed for 6 days. We went 3 times. Then gave up. It simply wasn‚Äôt nice. Two food options. No food labels, probably because it seemed like the leftovers from previous meals re-heated. That‚Äôs how it was presented/tasted and the staff were similarly uninterested. Be better off not doing it. It‚Äôs damaging the guest experience.

We never ate lunch or dinner at the hotel restaurant because of our breakfast / afternoon tea experience. There are plenty of nearby alternatives.

Snorkels and Fins - they had them, plenty. And we were led to believe from the hotel info that they were available to hire. But on enquiring we were told they were only for use with a formal tour, not just for guests to use in the adjacent ocean. Never had that one before!

Overall. We enjoyed the resort and would come back but there‚Äôs a great opportunity for management. Great location. Great accommodation. Only the Restaurant and some Maintenance lets It down. Hence it‚Äôs a 3.75 - 4.25. Not a 5 at the moment. But could be easily.","The rooms do have a nice private pool however a lot if mosquitos and despite nets there were gaps between the doors and windows.
AC didn‚Äôt really work despite being on lowest temp setting
Breakfast was not good and basic
As was the service, lots of staff but they are not on the ball.","Lovely place to relax.
The breakfast was the best one in the whole island.
The service and staff were really kind and helpful."

The interiordecor at Curry Traders is stunning, with a five-star table setting and a backdrop of a beautiful pool and outdoor area.

I particularly loved the outdoor kitchen setup, adding to the overall charm of the place. Additionally, their wine menu is fantastic, offering a perfect complement to the flavorful dishes.

Add to the mix numerous TVs throughout where they can show just about any sporting event broadcast anywhere, a free pool table, great laid back vibe, and even live music on occasions, this one one of those places where once you've been once, you'll find yourself gravitating back here again and again.

(And given one of the comments by someone else on here, I'll add I did not receive anything from anyone for writing this review.

üí∏ However, it's worth noting that negotiating the price of the fish is part of the experience here. On our second visit, we did encounter a bit of a challenge. The negotiation process took an unexpected turn with the man that was in charge, and it felt a bit uncomfortable as the prices seemed disproportionate and his attitude was a bit rude.

ü§ç Despite this, the overall food quality and taste were impressive. We recommend giving their fish dishes a try but be prepared for some haggling.
