Rooms have poor lighting and air conditioning. You have to walk through a narrow lane to reach the location. They however provide shuttle services to reach the main road. The staff is very humble and helpful. They try to provide the best service they can.,"Great little spot! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. There are lots of insects like a war zone, not that they can help that but good to be prepared. Everything is very open but we had a two level villa. They have two nice pools. Spa on site for massages. They offer free breakfast. They have a restaurant for lunch and dinner as well.","The staff had a good service attitude, but the room was dirty, the bed curtains and sheets were not clean. In addition, there were not only ants and geckos in the room, I even killed two bed bugs that sucked my blood üò≠

Also, if you can't ride a bike, it's best not to book here. The road is very narrow and vehicles can't drive in. Not being able to ride a bike means you have to walk to the city center on a very narrow road, which is very dangerous‚ö†Ô∏è","The place look great in the front but when you go inside the bungalow it's just üòµ‚Äçüí´. The towel, bedsheets and bed canopy is really dirty. The sliding door is awful. The staffs were friendly at least. Got new friend to sleep with at night","Went for massages in the spa only. 150,000 for 90 minute balinese massage. The massage itself was good except it‚Äôs the oilest I‚Äôve ever been. Cash only which they dodnt tell us until the end and we didn‚Äôt expect since we thought it was part of the hotel. They did not change the sheet on the table nor the blanket they use to cushion your face after. Just folded it back up for use for the next client. Would not recommend for cleanliness alone because of that."

Our total spend is 204k","Really nice view over the beautiful fields and palm trees. A big plus is also their deep-fried enoki mushrooms, which tasted really good. Their Pain aux raisins also tasted homemade, fresh and fantastic.

I ordered their aglio olio pasta and my Girlfriend their Cabonara. Even though we both ordered a pasta, my portion was only half as big. Which I think is a bit unfair...

In addition, the waiting time for the food was also really long, but the place is definitely still worth a visit.",Dined here for breakfasts during our stay at the Uma Dana back in late Aug. Thoroughly enjoyed their dragon fruit smoothie & the food options that was offered as part of the hotels stay (although rather limited compared to the normal menu). The food was great but took some time to arrive. Also dined here for dinner one of the nights. Loved the cordon blu & fried mushrooms!

When we checked the room, the sheets was dirty, many insects everywhere, water leak in the bathroom and ceiling broken. The hotel staff not professional at all, no excuses and poor service. We asked to change room the lady told us no available rooms we still insisted and finally 2 rooms was available....but the second one was worse than the first. The last one was the suite with private swimming pool. it looked like an abandoned place. Very dirty everywhere, impossible to swim because water was polluted. The rooms smelled too much humidity, very cold, and dirty. Not enough hot water for 2 people. And the food was horrible !!! The manager is a crook. Very rude ! He did not want to make any commercial gesture and charge us full rates for the room. We didn't have choice to stayed here because it was 11 pm and He wanted to put us out while one day before silent day it's a shame just because we complained. Never go to this hotel.","Dirty bed and room not cleaned since a while.
Water falling from the roof making the room wet all the time.
Security guy came to mop the floor but didn't take off his choose making the room dirtier... what a mess !
We ask to change the room and they tried to scam us buy giving us a cheaper room telling us it was an upgrade and that because the hotel was fully booked (no apologies) .
I finally found out that they have the suite villa available, we ask to visit and check the villa which was dirty as well and the sheets were dirty as well and ants in the bed in every room.
They finally charge us the full price off the villa scaming us.
The facilities are old and dirty, the personal unfriendly and no apologies.
I ask to call the manager he finally insulting me ans ask me to check out on a silent day when it's forbidden to go outside.
The worst place ever in Bali.  Big potential but really bad management and bad maintenance.
Small and dirty swimmingpool where only 3 people can swim and forbidden when it's raining.
Much better experience around really not worth it just run away from this place .","We stayed here for 5 nights, overall good experience,  beautiful garden, nice breakfast, clean. People were friendly. A bit loud if you choose room with a field/street view.","Stayed at the Villa for 4 nights and had a great experience. The staff are great, helpful and welcoming, I loved them all!
The location is great and can get to anywhere in ubud from here.
The restaurant is also reasonable but the portions are small. The breakfast is limited for vegan/veggie options.
The rooms are spacious but need better lighting. It was quite dark in some of the rooms (we booked 3).
The pool was amazing and open 24 hours! It was a beautiful villa and would definitely go again!"

It is a bit of a challenge to reach there, especially if it's raining, but the food and the place makes up for it. We had Vegan Arepas, Gnocchi and Ravioli, all of which were extremely delicious, especially the Jackfruit Arepas (I didn't like the   vegan bacon one as much) for me! They do accept credit cards with additional fees, and given the remoteness of the place, the prices are a bit on the higher side too, so yeah keep that in mind.

PS: It seems I probably caught dengue here, so please wear your mosquito repellents and full clothing just to be safe.","The yummiest handmade pastas & arepas in a beautiful jungle setting, worth the 12 min walk from alchemy or 1-2 min scooter ride. We tried the vegan jackfruit arepa & cassava gnocchi with white wine sauce and vegan fermented cheese, both are delicious & unique. The homemade pumpkin bread and blue coconut cake are also yummy, perfect pairing to enjoy with their flat white & latte. Will definitely come back to try their other pastas and arepas.","Tranquil restaurant in a jungle setting, next to a river.

Our villa had two spacious bedrooms with their own bathrooms in a garden atmosphere, a very spacious lounge area that extends over the entire area of the villa around the two bedrooms and, in addition to the spacious cooking area, has a dining area and a very comfortable living area. The furnishings would be very upmarket even by German standards. The individually designed furnishings are a very pleasant contrast to the sterile hotel atmosphere that is usually expected.  There is a lot of greenery outside and a pool with a covered seating area, all in Balinese style. Breakfast is freshly prepared by the staff every morning. It is different from a German breakfast, but very, very tasty. The reception, especially the very nice Putu, is available for all questions/requests at almost any time. The city center can be reached on foot in about 30-40 minutes. The first time you have to use Google maps to find your way around. But from the 2nd day onwards you can do without it.  You can of course use cabs, but we didn't do that because we are good walkers and you get to see so much more.","Absolutely perfect place for our first stay in Bali. The villa was spacious and comfy (though my back craved a Western-style sofa), the private pool was delectable, and the landscaping, vibe, and service were fabulous. Our driver Badunh, the booking office maven Putu, and the manager Ketut were all incredibly helpful and friendly. We felt very welcome and relaxed. Oh, and Murdi's breakfasts! Definitely try the Balinese pancakes. Thanks to everyone on the staff for making it such a wonderful experience. My only note is that you need a scooter or a car to get into Ubud, unless you are a very brave pedestrian indeed. If I had known that, I might have booked something closer to the center of Ubud. But then I would have missed out on the experience of Devi's Place and the sound of the gamelan rehearsals down the road.","We stayed in Villa Jepun. There are no words to describe this beautiful place in Ubud. The photos don't do justice to this place. This is one of those rare places that are more beautiful in reality. We loved having breakfast in the verandah, chilling in the pool in the afternoorn or just lazying on the sofa in the verandah. They have indoor and outdoor shower as well and I loved how the bathroom is designed. The view is also great. On a clear night, you can see millions of stars in the sky.
The staff is very helpful and friendly.
Devi's Place is very close to the center of Ubud, yet far away from its hustle bustle.
I wish I could have stayed here longer.
I know where I am going to stay the next time when I visit Ubud.","Great for a family or friends getaway. A small compound of 3 villas and a private pool, with a paddy field view. There are sights of insects' dirt in corners which is pretty okay due to the open space and garden. The breakfast is fresh and juicy.","Clean, spacious, quiet and beautiful! I stayed at Villa Shanti for 3 nights with my friends. Is a wonderful villa between the rice fields but still very close to the city centre. The villa was clean and spacious. The staff was amazing! They helped us with everything, from carrying our bags to organising our trips. They were very friendly and very lovely. I wish I could‚Äôve stayed longer ! Loved it !!!"

The location of the hotel is along the narrow roads so cars cannot get in. They offer buggy service from morning 7am - 10 pm and they were quick. The staff were helpful.
The swimming pool was also nicely maintained.
There are many restaurants which are at the walkable distance from here

Overall, I would recommend coming here.","The place is just nice, calm and peaceful. They ping you a day in advance about the stay and give you the necessary details. Location is a little interior where taxi's cannot go,, but the best part is they have buggy service. Any time you need service, you can just give them a call and they can help you.

Service is average, because we had to go and reach the front desk all the way from the room to contact them for anything.

Finally, a lot of lizards!! Be careful guys","Below average, no socket on worktop had to boil kettle on floor, tv not working one ensuite bathroom awful, dirty broken shower. Average staff","Do not recommend!

We stayed in the big 2 bed pool villa. The basics were tidy, however the beds were dirty, so much so that I freaked out and stripped the bed in the middle of the night. I found dead bugs (not bed bugs but looked like some kind of ant or mite) throughout and they were dusty and had stains. All the linens (bedding, towels and curtains) were gross in one way or another. Towels were really smelly, we asked for new ones and they were still smelling like they were dirty and sat wet. The bedding had stains over it, so did the curtains.

The worst of it was the pillows.. the has MOULD on them. Our friends didn‚Äôt believe us until they saw them.. then they checked theirs and they were the same! We ended up forcing them to purchase us fresh pillows.. to which they asked us to wait until the next day (it was like 3pm when we asked), we told them no way.

Otherwise, the breakfast was basic and only cleaned the room or gave fresh towels when you asked. The first day we had no towels and then they only gave us 2 (between the 4 of us) and expected us to use the same towels for the pool and showering.","Good & decent place to stay with good service.
We had booked two adjoining rooms with villa and living space in between.
The staff is friendly and really prompt. The place is also well kept.
Since Ubud is a central location to many places in Bali, we stayed here for quite some time.
We had the breakfast included in the package which had limited options. Lunch and dinner had to be taken from outside, but since the location is close to good cafes and places to eat you would hardly mind it."

This is an amazing tour to get to know wildlife in the area.This is one person - Sumadi - who leads a tour, not an office that you walk to, so don't go to the Google Maps location, OK? To contact for meetup instructions, message or phone her via WhatsApp, or email as listed on her website listed here. My tour metup at an excellent restaurant, hopped in 2 vans, and got dropped off at the trailhead. We walked the trail and wound up back at the restaurant for the included lunch.

Get ready! Sumadi's Bali Bird Walks is really a wildlife tour, a walk to see anything and everything she lays eyes on. From the moment the tour starts, she points out anything she can see, and doesn't really stop. Most of the time she's focused on birds, but she will show you insects, reptiles, and plants. Many times she will ask the group to move into a position to see and not disturb the creature she's pointing out. One key thing I enjoyed is that she does not lure creatures with food, which deeply disrupts their normal behaviours. If you want that kind of tour, well, don't.

She also shares her own story of growing up in Ubud, many cultural explanations, and even how the rice paddy system works. Su is very knowledgeable and will probably surprise you with her experiences.

The tour is also an excellent introduction to the area, so you can understand where and how to get around the rice paddies and communities of Penestanan. Since the tour I used the experience to do my own exploring and have seen more every day.

Ubud has a lot to offer the bird and nature lover. Do yourself a favour and book a tour with Su.","The perfect antidote to the noisy, busy streets of Bali. Su's tour was incredible and her energy is infectious. It is great for not only bird/animal watching but people watching too. You do have to walk around in the heat for a few hours but Su timed the shady stops really well in locations where we could continue to watch the birds. She has been running this tour since 1993 and doesn't read the internet reviews. She is amazing.","My husband and i did a walking bird tour with Su yesterday and absolutely loved it. Su was so knowledgeable, enthusiastic and engaging. Her passion for birds and nature is fabulous!

We walked through quiet neighbourhoods, amazing rice fields and alongside lush canyons.
While it was a long hot walk it wasn't difficult and we had small breaks along the way.
Su offers so much more than just Bird watching, she has a wealth of knowledge on all the local insects, trees and fruit and their importance to the farmers.

She made sure to assist all 4 of our small group in spotting birds and was clear and patient with instructions. We ended up seeing 25 birds on our walk which was amazing the highlights being the Cinnamon Bittern, Javan Kingfisher and for me a really good look at a handsome Brown throated Sunbird right at the end!

Would 100% recommend this tour. It's amazing value and full of passion. Would definitely bird watch with Su again!

Thank you Su!!!","Had an eye opening bird walk with Su. We learned a lot about agriculture, insects, birds, you name it. Su is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about her environment. She is a gem. Point to note - despite we would take short breaks in the shade, it is around 3-4 hours walk in the scorching heat. So you really need to wear the right clothes and prepare plenty of water. The path is not accessible for disabled people or if you have difficulty walking.",We had a wonderful time on this tour. Su is extremely knowledgeable and patient. She pointed out so many things I would have missed if I was walking in my own. She helped us to spot a wide range of birds and other creatures. It was so pleasant strolling among the rice paddies on narrow paths with Su. She is great company and we enjoyed it immensely.

I really recommend this villas for couples or small group.,Very quiet and peaceful stay at our private villa with a pool. The breakfast here is very tasty. The staff are so polite. They also provide shuttle service to and fro to the Ubud Palace. They also served us floating breakfast. Overall it was a wonderful experience.,"Excellent place to stay.
Customer centric staff and services.
We were served very well by Iluh with can do attitude for all of our requests.
They prepared flower bath tub for very little cost which was adorable.
Strongly recommend if you are looking for value for money villa with great staff."

Like a little slice of heaven - nestled away from the hustle and bustle of Ubud centre (however only a short 5 min trip away). Villas are modern and beautiful, private pools is great, shared pool is such a feature - with gorgeous sunsets and rice field views. Staff were kind and attentive. We can‚Äôt wait to stay here again. Thanks so much to the @podpadi team for hosting us.",Absolutely love this place. The staff made sure we were comfortable and relaxed. The pictures exactly showed how the place looked. But when you enter the place the atmosphere makes it perfect. Not possible to show on a picture. Really need to experience it. Love to come back!,"Podpadi is a great place for vacation. Honeymoon couple for photo shooting. Cool View, morning sunrise. Big room with private pool. And great toilet.
The staff are super friendly.
They cook delicious breakfast. Super helpful Host Made, cook, Donny make super best Sambal Matang. We will. Visit again next year!","Had the most incredible trip! The location was serene and tranquil, offering breathtaking views, especially during the morning sunrise. Room is spacious and clean. Donny, the cook, made breakfast something to eagerly anticipate. Special shoutout to the welcoming and friendly staff - Made, Ngurah, & Dewa. Their exceptional services made the experience truly awesome! I'm definitely planning a return visit.","We stayed two nights at Podpadi and absolutely loved it! Our host Made reached out before our check-in and was in constant communication to ensure the smooth running of our stay. The location of the villa is a bit off the main road and about 10-15 minutes from Ubud town but instructions to get there were clear and the staff were extremely helpful, helping us carry our luggage. The room itself was spacious and tidy with all the basic amenities you might need. The private pool was perfect and an even bigger infinity pool in the shared space. Made helped us book massages and pedicure services which was super easy and very relaxing! We would definitely recommend staying here and will hopefully visit again in the future. Thank you!"

The bathroom is big but you have to shower in the bathtub & have to bend down to wash yourself & isn‚Äôt comfortable, there is also a lot of water than runs off the bathtub after your shower so the bathroom floor is wet. It would be better if they had a shower curtain. The bathroom window also has a gap so there can be insects & an open vent in the front door so make sure to bring insect repellent. Apart from that the stay was pleasant, there is a lovely small pool you can relax at & the breakfast is served at the Tropical Ants restaurant in front of the place (limited breakfast options for guests). The staff were very friendly & also helped us get some laundry done when the local laundry place was closed. There are a few other cafes/restaurants within 4mins walk but they serve practically the same menu. If you are after a relaxing stay outside of main Ubud then this might suit you as it is more quiet away from the hustle & bustle. If you are wanting access to main Ubud then this wouldn‚Äôt be suitable. We stayed here as part of a yoga package & this accommodation was chosen for us. Gave it 3 stars as I was hoping the facilities were a bit less basic & the room is a bit dated.","This was our first stay in Bali and we couldn‚Äôt be happier with the service we received. From the beginning of our trip, the hotels driver ‚ÄòMade‚Äô to the daily morning Yoga provided from ‚ÄòAyung‚Äô who were both incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. Made was our driver whilst we stayed at the hotel and he was just fantastic. Suggested the best local restaurants, tours and helped whenever we needed anything. As for the hotel, they were just lovely.

The hotels restaurant is one that we also visited daily- the food and coffee was genuinely some of the best we had while staying in Bali. The location of this resort was also very convenient and just beautiful. Only a short drive to main Ubud city but also escapes the noise.

The yoga instructor Ayung was so lovely. He taught us lots about traditional Yoga and moves that we have not learnt before- we strongly recommend doing the 3 day yoga package that comes with the river rafting and massage. Was totally worth it.

We will be returning. Thank you everyone at Uma Dana for making this holiday magical üß°","I have stayed for around 2 weeks here and I would like to breakdown some good and might be a bit fair/not so good opinions according to my stay.

(+)
- this place is very spacious for this price. my room has big spaces included a good/quite big bathroom
- their staffs are very friendly and helpful (but they don‚Äôt have a 24hr service/someone that stays overnight)
- it‚Äôs located in a between of central area or local area. With a good cafe in front (Tropical Ants)
- has a good view

(-)
- the water has shut off a few times esp. during midnights
- i have seen some reviews about the booking methods because I have booked my room via Traveloka but they placed me into another type of rooms. However, they‚Äôve still managed to help me move after a few days.","This hotel is in the middle of rice field, amazing environment, very calm and peaceful. Really enjoyed our stay. Good Food is available nearby the hotel. Didn‚Äôt find any problem at all so giving 5 star rating üëçüèª",The hotel is nice and all the staff friendly. The pool is nice.  We did have trouble when checking in though as we had paid for and booked a deluxe double but when we arrived they said the room was already booked so we had to stay in a twin room which caused a lot of confusion and was quite inconvenient. Not sure why they double book rooms and the room was still saying available on booking.com. Other than that we enjoyed our stay

We will be coming back!

One of the highlights of my stay was undoubtedly the gorgeous grounds and gardens surrounding the villas, with only a short walk out the back to the rice paddies and gorgeous views. You feel like you‚Äôre hidden away in the jungle inside Lily Lane, but you have everything you need nearby. The villa's outdoor spaces are a paradise, particularly the restaurant and community garden. We chose to have our breakfast in the restaurant and it was incredible, both the food and the serene atmosphere!

However, the staff‚Äôs exceptional hospitality truly sets Lily Lane apart. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with genuine warmth and kindness, and every effort was made to ensure that my stay was perfect. Lily Lane went above and beyond to ensure that I felt pampered and cared for throughout my stay.

If you're looking for a peaceful retreat in the heart of Ubud, look no further than Lily Lane. It truly is a slice of paradise on earth.","Ubud dreams come true! Beautiful villas in a tranquil environment. Wonderful staff who create a relaxed and welcoming experience. So peaceful but within reach of all Ubud‚Äôs attractions.  Impressed by the owners‚Äô commitment to the local community and social enterprise. Go to Lily Lane!!
With heartfelt thanks to the Lily Lane family. Lucy & Paul","Lily Lane Villas stands above the rest in the Penestanan area. We stayed in Villa 3 which is a fabulous 1 bedroom Villa with a kitchen if self catering is your thing and a small pool. Beautifully presented and tucked away off the main road, nothing is too much trouble for the staff.  Highlights for us were the organic garden, a source of fresh produce picked daily for meals, and the communal space known as the Lily Pad.  Lily Lane villas will soothe your soul and leave you refreshed and ready to enjoy your holiday.","Manager is quite friendly and well mannered.
All the staffs are well behaving and so co operative. Service is quite fast. They are proving best staff service i have ever experienced in my life.
And one of the best part is the breaks fast. Quite delicious üòã and refreshing. They provide best food to start your day with.
The villa is best for family as well as good for couples. Seems like staying in my own house üè†. Just loving the stay‚ù£Ô∏è","We stayed at Lily Lane Villas in April 2022. The lack of tourists for about 2 years (because of COVID-19) could mean that hotels and accomadations are neglected. Therefore we were very pleased that this is not the case with Lily Lane Villas at all. Our villa is very well maintained and clean, as are other villas we could have a look at.

We really enjoyed our stay at Lily Lane. The owners and the staff were extremly helpful, friendly and really took care of us.

The villas are situated a little bit outside of Ubud. We rented bicycles to get around. It is an enjoyable 15 minute ride along the rice paddies into town. By motorbike it will only take a few minutes. You could also hire a taxi for very little money.

There are some nice local and tourist restaurants within walking distance. While staying at Lily Lane you get to experience living in a Balinese village with an intact community."

Home cooked style food with Arni's love. We tried to eat breakfast and lunch here during our stay.
She cooks and serves all by herself, so the seats are limited. Try to visit off peak hour so that you can get a seat.
All food was perfectly cooked and served, just the pancake was a bit think comparing to western style pancake.","I urge everyone who looks at this restaurant to go have breakfast here daily.  It‚Äôs hidden. It‚Äôs a great kept secret and deserves a ton of business and luck.  It‚Äôs a mom and pop place but boy it‚Äôs like sitting in a home kitchen.  Go and enjoy.

Must haves:
- Smoothie Bowl
- Banana Pancake
- Garlic Toast with Eggs + Gauc.
The Gauc is amazing","Cant get enough of her food! The owner is the sweetest lady, like your grandmother away from home. Her food is delicious and reasonably priced. Already looking forward to my next meal.","Come for breakfast, lunch or an early dinner.

The host was really helpful. Located slightly interior of Ubud. Ubud town is 5-10 mins drive from this place. Excellently located beside small paddy fields. The road towards villa is narrow and only bikes can pass.,"We stayed 5 nights at this wonderful paradise. We were warmly welcomed to our 2 bedroom private pool villa by Ketut Diani and family. The villa comes with a kitchen where you can cook some breakfast or meals if you need to. It has a proper gas stove, some cooking pots and pens, plates, utensils, knives & a 300+ liter fridge.

The best part must be the pool where my kids lounge in for long hours in the day and at night.

The villa is about 15 minutes walk to the main road, you pass by other villas, rice fields, restaurants, warongs, spas, marts, laundry service etc. this is a relatively self contained village with a very special charm.

The bedrooms: each had a large 4 poster king bed with mosquito net, a dressing table, TV, wifi, a semi outdoor toilet.

Would highly recommend this villa to others. Do note that cars are not allowed in the village and you need to get around either by motorbike or walking. Did see 1 or 2 buggy but did not ask for their service.","This villa is worth to live. We stayed there for 3 days in Ubud. Villa has all the amenities you need at home. Very neat and clean. Caretaker is really nice. She is always available to help you with everything. Location is the only negative point. Though not far from Ubud art center but around 300-400 meter way is very narrow and
Only two wheeler can reach.","Sometimes you get what you pay for. I wondered why this place wasso cheap. What it does not say in any advertising is that you cant get there by car. You get dropped off then picked up by motorbike for the last km. This service is only for arrival and departure. The rest of the time you need to walk it. Though the pictures of the villa have TVs, they have all been removed.  We used the  villa's recommended restaurant which delivered to it but they twice cancelled the order. I would have tolerated all of this except for the construction next door. The owner is  building a new villa and 7 days a week there is construction work from 7am. If you want the villa for privacy you wont get this either as the builders are working above the villa wall. When we tried to discuss this the manager had gone fishing and was uncontactable and the staff said they could not contact him either. No one seemed to see an issue with the noise of a new building being built adjacent to the villa wall. If this had of been adverstised as such I would not have had an issue with it. After five hours the owner agreed to allow us to move elsewhere but we had by then lost the place we had found.",Pondok Gadri's Villa 1 is a dream! The villa is beautiful. The garden is so lush and provides privacy and the feeling like you're in your own little paradise. It feels like a home away from home. The wifi is fast. The room is cleaned daily and the staff provided us with extra towels when requested. There are a few restaurants nearby that you can easily walk to or order take out from. My partner and I felt safe walking through the village at all times of the day.

Excellent cocktails and we appreciated the owners commitment to sustainability with low waste practise using banana leaf bowls in some dishes and natural biodegradable straws . Please note this place is quite difficult to enter though  - the stairs are abnormally high  and would be impossible for anyone with mobility issues. I‚Äôm able bodied but quite short and needed assistance coming down.","Kemulan is one of the places we definitely recommend going to. The seating area is open but covered. One wall is traditionally decorated, and it provides an authentic experience.
The staff is polite and welcoming.

The food is so tasty that you will want to come again and again.

We visited Kemulan twice during our stay.

We only ordered from the vegan menu.
Starter: kemulan tacos
Grilled: Mushroom tofu cauliflower sate (we had this both times as it was so so good)
Vegan rendang
And Jackfruit steak
