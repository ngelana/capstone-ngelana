There is a private pool with an ocean view. The price is reasonable and affordable compared to other accommodations around Uluwatu. The spa was impressive, with great service and an excellent atmosphere! I heard the ocean waves during the 1-hour spa session, which was very relaxing.

Breakfast was good, and all the waiters were friendly and informative. I had breakfast while enjoying the breathtaking view. I ordered Eggs Benedict on the first day and an American Breakfast on the second day. Both dishes were perfect‚Äînot too salty, and the taste was balanced.

I tried a 1-hour yoga session at 9 AM in BiuBiu. It was relaxing, and the instructor was friendly and chill. He knows how to teach at a beginner level as well.","It is a beautiful hotel with unbeatable sea views, a place with a chillout atmosphere like you will not find anywhere else.  We also had a small incident due to the rain that Janice from the reception, along with the rest of her hotel colleagues, solved perfectly, giving the client enough motivation to want to return and recommend it to the rest of the people we know, totally recommended!","We got very very sick from the food in this hotel. We had to call a doctor who administered IV fluid and several injections. Tests showed a salmonella infection and we had to take antibiotics. Doctor bill was over 700 Euro. At no point anyone at the hotel offered any help. They were only interested in getting us out of the room in time for the new guests. They even forced us to pay 20 Euro for the meal that made us sick! Absolutely disgusting! I‚Äôve never been treated so disrespectfully in a hotel. They didn‚Äôt even care that there was salmonella in their kitchen and just kept de restaurant open. Don‚Äôt ever go here!
The room itself was also bad and outdated. Airconditioning didn‚Äôt work properly so the room was very hot. The shower is hot then cold all the time.","Excellent resort, great views of cliff and the ocean, amazing pools, good food and great service! We really enjoyed just staying in the resort with the fantastic view and location!
Perfect honeymoon resort with good access to beaches around. The breakfast was good although not impressive but we had dinner once and it was great!
Highly recommend!","Beautiful resort, great views, wonderful sunset. There is a descent to a private beach below, where there are usually either no people or very few of them. The beach is very beautiful and clean. Been here about 5 times, but the food was always 6/10 every time."

The beach is lovely, with nice, medium waves (we came between high and low tide), the beach is quite clean, with workers from the Ayana resort occasionally checking for litter (there is nearly none either way)
There is a nice beach area, where you can sunbathe, order some beverages, and other services such as massages and braid making.
There are cliffs and multiple rock outcrops, where you can explore the shallow rock pools and see small crabs and anemones. Although the cliff is currently being reinforced next to the beach area, it is possible to explore further during low tide.",Experience a very wonderful beach vacation. Here you can feel the waves and the beautiful time on the beach. The elevator going down from the sky and the beautiful scenery are worth your time!,"It‚Äôs owned by Ayana Resort, and for guests only. You need to walk down about 40m by stairs or elevator down to the beach. White sand beach. They have small bar sell fresh coconut, snack and light meal such as satay, meat ball soup (bakso) etc","Access is free to guests at Ayana. There are 2 main areas - we went to the sunset view area which is a short walk away but much quieter.

The tide was rising quite fast when we went so we weren‚Äôt really able to swim but the sunset view was fantastic and the sand was nice on the feet.

Some of our friends did activities such as hair braiding and picnics on the beach. Everyone enjoyed themselves.

The good thing about being on a private beach as well is minimal trash on the shore.

Note: the elevator was broken in Oct 2023 so you would have to walk down (and up!) quite a bit of stairs. The pros is that the beach was much quieter. The cons is obviously it was more of a workout especially going up. The view was well worth it though!","Kubu beach is very nice. Lovely staff on the beach, good food and drinks."

Every detail is impeccable. The photos don't do it justice. It is really a hidden gem .   We just celebrated my fiances birthday there and the staff went way out of their way to make it special. We ordered a special meal and cake and it was divine. The bath tub was so nice. The property is full of special details. If you are  looking for something superb, this is the experience you want.",this was our first accommodation in Bali. We had a warm welcome. We enjoyed our villa by the pool with a view of the ocean. The food in the restaurant is excellent and we always only ate there. The breakfast was fresh and rich. The villa was amazing and exotic like everything in this hotel. Definitely a warm recommendation for a dream vacation.,"I strongly recommend La Cabane after having stayed for 3 nights also with a 10 mo old baby. The service was flawless and all requests we had we got help from the staff to fulfill. The bungalows are nice, bathroom is outdoors however we did not have anything against that. We had geckos visiting our walls however I assume you should count on that staying next to nature. There are not a lot of restaurants within walking distance, however a few including neighbouring hotels, but transportation is easily arranged via the reception.","La Cabane Bali is very close to the beach. We stayed in the SOL room which has a King bed (a canopy bed), a small table and a coffee table in the room. The room is small and there's not much space left after the furniture. There's a fixed breakfast menu, and one person can order only 1 item of off that menu. The hostess Celine is very helpful while booking your stay. Unfortunately she isn't always in Bali. The place overall is very asthetic and pleasing to the eye but a lot could be still improved to match with the high prices.","Absolutely amazing place!
Most of all the staff were so kind, welcoming, and very helpful. Such a wonderful experience!
Thank you Wayan for assisting very quickly with a last moment check in.
And thank you to all kitchen staff for delicious food and Strong coffee :)

terima kasih banyak

Our cash were stolen when we left our bags and wallet in the living room on the last day. After which, we found out that the care taker's room has a side door directly accessing the main house. We confronted them and wanted to view the cctv but they were giving all sorts of excuses. Left with great disappointment and bitter taste.","Had a great time at the house! Perfect for families or groups of friends. The place is super clean and well maintained. The location could not be better, it is in-front of a gorgeous beach (Balangan beach) and a great deal of great restaurants! The staff at the villa was super nice and took good care of us","We recently had the pleasure of staying at Balangan Beach Villa and overall, it was a delightful experience. We were a group of 7 friends. This luxurious villa offers a total of five rooms, providing ample space and comfort for guests. The rooms were tastefully designed, exuding an elegant and modern ambiance.

One of the highlights of Balangan Beach Villa was its cleanliness. The entire property was impeccably maintained, and the rooms were spotless. It was evident that the staff took great pride in ensuring a high standard of cleanliness throughout the villa.

While the villa boasts a small swimming pool, it still provided a refreshing retreat to cool off after a day of exploring the beautiful surroundings. Though compact, the pool area was well-maintained, adding to the overall charm of the property.

The location of Balangan Beach Villa, situated in the southern part of Jimbaran, proved to be advantageous. While the nearby beach may not have met our expectations, the villa's strategic location allowed for easy access to various attractions within a 20-30 minute car or scooter ride. This made it convenient for us to explore the nearby beaches and other points of interest in the area.

During our stay, we had the pleasure of meeting Wahan, the lady who resides at the villa and provides assistance to guests. She was not only friendly and accommodating but also proved to be extremely helpful throughout our stay. Wahan went above and beyond to ensure our needs were met, even offering additional services such as laundry service (with reasonable extra charges). Additionally, she arranged for a driver to transport us to different destinations, which made our travel arrangements hassle-free.

In conclusion, I highly recommend Balangan Beach Villa for anyone seeking a luxurious and comfortable stay in Jimbaran. The clean and well-appointed rooms, along with the assistance of Wahan, make for a truly enjoyable experience. Despite the nearby beach not meeting our expectations, the villa's convenient location allows for easy exploration of the surrounding areas. Whether you're looking to relax by the small swimming pool or embark on local adventures, Balangan Beach Villa offers a great base for your stay in Jimbaran.","It was our third stay at the Villa with a group of friends and I must say that it felt like we had returned home to a haven of total relaxation. From the moment we arrived late at night the staff were there to welcome us. It was wonderful being awoken each morning to the sound of cockrels in the distance. Each morning we would go for an hour's walk in the cool and return to a sumptuous breakfast of the most amazing fruit and fresh bread, etc. Wyanne cooked us bacon and eggs on request as well as a delicious nasi goreng and bean salad one evening. Otherwise we would catch a taxi (cheap) to restaurants or walk to La Joya restaurant down the road. During the day it would be lazing around the pool reading and swimming or taking a day tour.  After 7 nights we reluctantly left the Villa to spend our final 4 nights in Seminyak and whilst we partook of some wonderful restaurants whilst there, the accommodation was no where near as good as at the Villa, nor as peaceful and relaxing as we had to share our pool with dozens of other people and we missed the sound of the cockrels each morning. Thank you to Katuk, Wyanne and staff for making our stay so memorable yet again. See you next year."

But they were a family of workers or owners of the restaurant. This was very cute! They love to be there - it makes the good energy of this business.

I love their chicken geprek (fried chicken), grill honey chicken and mie goreng. This is the best dive spot we found in bali. I Will definitely recommend to friends any anyone. We will come back next time we visit!","We didn‚Äôt have a very good experience here. When we arrived we had to go look for the menu as the staff didn‚Äôt seem to notice we were waiting even though the place was empty besides 1 other couple. After ordering it took 30 minutes to arrive. I ordered lalapan (tempe/tofu)which is commonly served with vegetables. I got 2 slices of cucumber and 3 pieces of cabbage with holes in it. The presentation was also lacking. The tempe was ok. We also ordered an omelette which was very salty. Comes with some supermarket type ketchup sauce. They forgot the extra rice we ordered and when we asked for rice they put it extra on the bill. Had to remind them they listed it double. If the restaurant was busy all these small mistakes can be understandable but like I said we were almost alone. The prices are to high for the quality in my opinion. Had better tasting authentic food for less elsewhere. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs expensive, just in comparison to other local places you can get better food.","Real good traditional food! We tested Nasi goreng chicken and Mie goreng seafood, both were great and not spicy! Good quality price!","Pedro's is without doubt the best little restaurant in the Balangan area.
It offers a variety of appetizering food options. All at a very reasonable price
Pedro is really friendly, helpful and speaks great English.","Delicious food and generous servings.
