Upon entry, someone will explain the different types of wood used for carving and explain the different expert levels of carving. You can only take photos outside. Once inside, photos are prohibited. The level of skill is extremely high. The details of each statue are so precise and accurate, perhaps this is why it is so expensive to buy. This was my only flaw. The cheapest, which was also the smallest carving, was at Rp 4 000 000.
Either than the cost being so high, it was still nice to see how all the wood making and carving is done",Nice place to buy souvenir wood carvings. You can watch the artists work and learn about the different types of wood used. I think the prices are fair for the quality of work. The gallery is large with a variety of different carvings in various sizes and wood types.,"Great masterpieces from different woods, hand-made from very talented people.","Seeing some statues is cool, and the entrance is free, but it's overall just a wood statue shop.

Our villa felt a bit like a nature cottage and was fully constructed of wood. It's one spacious room equipped with a comfortable bed, wardrobe and desk, air conditioning, ceiling fan and good wifi. It was clean, and water and coffee were replenished daily. The villa has a semi-outdoor bathroom and a private swimming pool with lounge chairs. The villa's garden is sheltered, offering privacy, and there's also a covered terrace. It's a wonderfully quiet and peaceful area, and waking up there is a bliss. With the motorbike rented at the villa we could easily reach the center of Ubud (15-20 minutes). The owners were such a sweet and friendly family; they invited us to one of their children's ceremonies. I had a meal with them and was treated to a delicious homemade coconut drink (alcohol). They told us about the area, Balinese customs, and their family. The family made our stay unforgettable; thank you for that!

Ps. It's better to book directly with the family instead of via a platform!","We stayed  4 days 3 nights
Our departure was very late, the location is inside the small street so you have to park and stop your car at the street, but I recommend you to catch a Grab car or online taxi instead","I will recommend Sarini Villas highly, especially for someone who will escape from the busy areas/commercial tourist places in Bali, including the other daily issues and headaches.  Here you have a chance to become closer to the Balinese culture and getting know more about the people. Sarini Villas is located in the peaceful village Kemenuh, which is not far away from Ubud (only 15 minutes by car). The village itself is offering many places for visiting like waterfalls, different beautiful art workshops, good restaurants and coffee shops.  Cleanliness is one of the most important things for choosing Sarini Villas. During my stay, my room was always clean with a comfortable bed. The villas have a beautiful private pool, which is one of the unique advantages for choosing the Sarini Villas, compared to other villas and hotels in this area.
Something that make my staying in this place more memorable was the kindness and hospitality from Gus Angga family, which was exceptional. The owner, Gus Angga father was always kind and had many good advises and tips, that helped me to plan my staying better and visiting many more places around Ubud.  Gus Angga is the best daily manager who always focuses on providing the best service for all the guests. I had unforgettable   staying there and will never forget the kindness of this beautiful family. By especial thanks to my friend and  the best Bali tourist guide Putu, Cafe Ubud- IB Ketut Perama Teja, my taxi driver Yogi, good friend Widi and whole the Gus Angga family, I will absolutely choose this a place again, when I am back in Bali.",Villas are located at a very quiet and pleasant place. If you’re looking for peaceful places I would recommend this. Villas are very beautiful and aesthetically designed.,"We had a great stay at Sarini Villas. Widi, Gus Man and their family are so helpful and welcoming.
I would recommend this stay to anyone looking for some tranquility and privacy in a local village outside the hustle and bustle of central Ubud."

One of my favourite places to eat and chat with friends after weekend rides around Bali. The owners are really friendly and open.
Food never disappoint. Serbet's Rendang can compete with Sumatran one, rich and tender meat. Also I enjoyed Jawan soup. My friends has their own lovely dishes.
Moreover, Andre (one of the owners) is from Surabaya, and before going to this city in my Java trip, I received useful foody hints about local street food there.","Awesome place. Andre is super friendly and speaks English fluently. Best nasi goreng we had so far in Bali. Lycee tea suggested. Stylish environment, best food at a great price! Than you Andre, we had a wonderful time at Warung Serbet!","Funtastic, warm, very friendly people (read:owner and staf). Very recommended Indonesian restaurant around Ubud. Authentic and above average food taste 👍🏻😄👏","We ordered nasi goreng terasi and bakmi Jawa, the taste is really good, very indonesian taste and the portion is good enough.

The pizza was really good, better than I expected, although it wasn’t as fluffy as what I had back in Rome. We tried the tasty black pasta too (the chef modified it to vegetarian version. Thanks!).
