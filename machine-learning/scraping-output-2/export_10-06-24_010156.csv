Only 200m from pasar Agung Peninjoan. The entrance is small, but insiden you will find it homey to dine in. Frankly, I didn't expect their price is so cheap for a resto standard. They have lots variants of tipat (tipat cantok, tipat sayur and so on), rujak (rujak pindang, rujak gula, and so on), es (es campur, es daluman, loloh, and so on). All menu is between 10-20k, which is affordable compared to their big portion and delicious taste. Although, I wait for quite a long time for the food preparation, due to long queue of gojek/grab orders.","First time here, we were looking for traditional Balinese snacks and they have so many varians. From laklak freshly made, lopis, sticky rice with pumpkins (my favourite), etc. They also have traditional drink Loloh Cemcem, made from some leaves, not my choice because it's smell not good for me.
Price are very cheap. You can order lots from the menu and share with your friends.
They have rice field view, fresh and green, very comfortable and homey.","The foods were good, but sometimes I found out that the utensils were smelly. Maybe they weren't washing it nicely, Im not really sure.
The taste of the foods isn't consistent.","Received a burnt bubur with a extremely toxic after taste. Not edible at all. Tipat just salty, no peanut flavor."

I decided to come to this place for lawar in Bali due to the cleanliness. And boy was I not disappointed. Came around 2+ pm so seats were aplenty. There was a younger girl who could speak English so it helped with the ordering.

Took a pack of snack, pork rinds, which costed 5k. Bottle of water was another 3k or so. The pork, chicken,sate  and lawar combo, with the soup came up to be about 27k. Total 35k. Pretty decent portion and meal for that price.

My favorite was the lawar of course. Slather their chilli onto your rice and you'll be asking for seconds in no time. The meat was tender and flavorful.

Do note that parking will set you back 2k as well as they have someone manning the area. Other than that, it's all good! Definitely will come back again.",warung lawar penatih is the best place to try balinese food,"Lawar Penatih is delicious cuisine, health and make me try it more and more ( don't do that, no good for your diet) just eat for lunch is about 400 grams/portion, half of it are mix from meat, coconut, and another balinese herbs... of course with 250gr cooked rice, and another interesting is balinese soup, it's hot make you sweat",Good food good serveüî•üî•üî•,"Traditional Balinese food warungs, delicious taste of the ""lawar"" (balinese traditional food which made by mixing chopped vegetables and meat..usually pork and chicken) and also ""jukut ares"" soup made from banana stems...reasonable price..."
