Tabanan, Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali 82111, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=14452825997346982961,OPERATIONAL,+62 822-4775-0982,restaurant,"restaurant, indonesian_restaurant, food",4.6,1720,PRICE_LEVEL_INEXPENSIVE,A nice quiet place in the corner of Tabanan. They serve good babi guling with rich pork bone broth and also tempong dishes.,"I visited this place on 4th March 2023. Hopefully, this review is still relevant when I'm posting it.

I came here after searching for pork cuisine in Tabanan (where the city is said to be more advanced and has received many foreign franchises such as KFC, McD, etc.). From Google Maps, I found Warung Men Sedu, which is quite hidden but still easy to find, with a fairly flat and easy-to-pass road for both cars and motorcycles. The parking area here is also quite spacious, I saw cars parked on the side of the road.

When I came here, the restaurant was not crowded, so it was easy to order at the cashier and say I wanted the food below or above. Because I saw the food above was more attractive, I went upstairs. The view towards the forest from there was quite interesting. The food arrived about 5-10 minutes after I ordered, quite fast.

The food was delicious, as I like pork, especially the sweet taste of the pork satay. The Kremes, which is a signature dish of this place, was also delicious, to the point that I ordered an extra portion just for the Kremes alone. The drink I ordered was warm lime juice, nothing special about the drink. The balanced portion made me not too full, but I could add more for the next meal.

Overall, it was good, the price was also below average, relatively cheap for the tourists even locals. As far as I remember, I spent less than 40 thousand rupiahs, which included the drink and the extra Kremes. I will come back again if I have friends to invite.","Warung Men Sedu has been open since the 2000s, it used to be located inside the Dauh Pala Market.  The food served has a distinctive taste, soy sauce pork and crispy pork skin are different menus.  Now the location is in the house.  like eating at home.  If the table is full, you can sit on the terrace or in the bale bangong and bale dangin.  A serving of Be Genyol rice with side dishes of besisit, pork soy sauce, pork satay, lawar, drizzled with a little gravy and crispy and tasty crispy pork skin","When we came here, Unfortunately we just have late lunch, so we just order 1 main course, and 2 desserts, but it was really GOOD, the owner is humble, the serbicebis great, locals is their regular customer, so this place is RECOMMENDED should you looking for any local restaurant in Tabanan üòÅüëçüëçüëç‚úå‚úå","We ordered Nasi Biasa, Nasi Special and chicken satay. Taste is nice and wonderful. Even normal portion is filling. Will upgrade to 5-star when the soup is more herby, aromatic and less salty. Sit on the top floor for breeze and views of a small valley. Tall people, please watch out for your head on the way to the top floor. Friendly and speedy service. Will go again for sure."
