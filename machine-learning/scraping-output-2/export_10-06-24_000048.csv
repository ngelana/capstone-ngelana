Susut, Kabupaten Bangli, Bali 80661, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=11779977367830707397,OPERATIONAL,+62 878-6144-3565,guest_house,"guest_house, lodging",5,5,,"Putu is the best host we have ever had! We have traveled extensively, and have been using Airbnb for years.

I recommend staying 3-4 nights, there is plenty to do and experience. Very well located, Ubud itself is overrun and crowded in comparison.

The accommodation was clean and comfortable (the valley cools down at night). The morning breakfast was different each time, allowing us to try many Indonesian delights. The nearby restaurant made dinner for us when we arrived home late at night (delicious chicken nasi goreng).

Putu has a car and is happy to take you to his favorite local spots including clean flowing waterfalls,  a unique restaurant carved  into a river valley and mountain hikes along volcanoes to the North.

Putu also has a late model Honda scooter available if you want the freedom to explore the surrounding area at your leisure (Ubud 30min away, however, we found Susut to be much more beautiful and quiet …perfect sunsets over pristine rice paddies)

If you are interested in cooking authentic Balinese food you can meet Putu’s mother - we spent a morning together at the markets before heading home to make a fish curry

If you are interested in architecture and bamboo construction you can learn alot from Putu and his father (they built the home together)",,,,
