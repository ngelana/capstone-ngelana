They are rather packed for a dinner, and people come and go while we were eating, so it‚Äôs definitely popular. The sambal is their main point though, so it looks like I‚Äôm not the target market.","They serve Indonesian food and various sambal or spices

Lunch time is very crowded your order will be take long

Affordable price
Food is tasty, they offer fried or grill
Spacious parking lot","Calling out all spicy lovers to go to this restaurant!!
All food taste good with affordable price. The parking area wasn't that large but quite enough for 20 motorbikes and maybe 2 cars. They have many variants of sambal you can try it one by one. I really love their ""sambal terasi matang"" and ""sambal bajak"". Payment method is available for cash and debit-cardüëç",Offers halal food known to locals here . Was brought by our local driver and this place did not disappoint. Dishes were cooked on the spot and tasted really really good! Portion are small but prove is reasonable . Rice would be charged as per pax but can be refillable . Great hidden gem!

It was only me and my husband enjoying their meals, coffee, and cake. All of our orders were top notch. Price also fair. Hence, quiet surprise they‚Äôre empty of customers. Located next to main road, close to the Bali Bird Park. Worth a try.","Very good food at good prices especially batagor dumplings and amazing lychee and lemon iced tea, pleasant service","Stopped by here for lunch in between the bird park and the butterfly park. Food was quite good, though not super fantastic. Enjoyed the nasi goreng and mie goreng. Ayam panggang was decent but not the best. I thought my iced latte was too watered down. Pumpkin soup was too much pumpkin and not enough cream. Desserts wise, the oreo cheesecake had too much cream and not enough oreo, and the opera was a tad dry though the taste is quite good.

Atmosphere is not bad, quite a big place with lots of space, and it wasn't busy on a late Saturday lunch.","Tasty nasi goreng and mie goreng, pizza was great too and so was beef burger. Fries portion too small. Ayam pangang manis was the least impressive along with pumpkin soup which was too viscous and thick. Juices and iced teas were fresh and cooling. Oreo cheesecake and classic opera were too dense, didn't enjoy them as much. Service was good, they serve complimentary cold water, place was clean and spacious, toilets are indoors and adequate. Overall a nice place to stop by for lunch after visiting Bali Bird Park. Highly recommend.","Loved the food. The menu is very good. We tried nasi goreng seafood, nasi goreng kembing, Gerang Asem Iga, Gulai Nangka, teriyaki salmon and chicken burger. All were so tasty. Wanted to try papaya salad too. Next time may be. Ice milk coffee was good. Nice decent brownie too. Coffee was same as melbourne.
Very affordable price with out the worry about hygiene as I have young kids with me.
Very nice environment.
We saw the bird park and reptile park and this resturant is 7 min from there.
