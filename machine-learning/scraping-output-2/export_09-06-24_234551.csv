It is worth the treck to get there.
Park at the area where the road gets washed out and steep.
Walk the last 100 meters to the entrance trail.
20K admission for trail upkeep.","Most favourite waterfall we visited, and we visited a lot. It's a fair hike on a scooter but well worth the visit. Donation to maintain the space.

We were gifted fresh passionfruit when we arrived and ate this on the way down.  Wonderful friendly service.","Mixed feelings about this review because I absolutely love the place but don't want it to change from too many visitors!
My favourite waterfall I've visited in Bali, probably because me and my friend were the only visitors there. The manager? Kind of guy or care taker is great and got us fresh coconuts, he has a donation box for people to give what they feel is worth and I have way more than the other waterfalls ask just because the way he has looked after the land and maintained it with planting trees and local medicinal herbs.

He got us to ride all the way down to it instead of parking up the top but it's a steep difficult ride on a scooter if you aren't experienced (my friend fell off) otherwise it's a few hundred metre walk and then further steps down.

Great place to visit","Hidden waterfall, not many people (I was alone there!). You can't swim there but anyway it is very nice. I liked that to get there you need to walk around 10 mins so it feels like a well-earned secret place.","Nice experience visiting the waterfall. The couple who runs the nature around it ask for 20K entrance fee, which is ok. They offered us local fruits (bananas and Mangus) and even coffee. It‚Äôs a nice (but challenging, slippery) road down and the waterfall is beautiful. We were the only ones there."

The location is like paradise with lots of fresh fruit trees, a very clean and pretty pool with turquoise water and at night you can hear the beautiful sounds of the jungle from your bed. The boys from the service were so friendly and helpful, especially Agung was such a pleasant person, very calm and always so polite. For such a long stay the variety of the breakfast could have been a little bigger but that probably doesn't affect most people. We also had the pleasure to meet the owner who drove us to the lodge and who was very informative and funny. Scooter rental was easy too and same as laundry service it can be managed by the team. I can't give less than 5 stars for this experience and can only recommend  anyone to come here and visit this magical place!","This place is perfect when you look for a more quiet , tranquil and colder! Place in Bali ;) The lodge is beautifully situated in the middle of the jungle - you can walk from there to a nice little waterfall - also rent a Scooter and explore other areas close by (mt. Batur e.g.) The staff is very friendly and Professional- they always made sure I had a perfect time :) They have a kitchen as well - so you can always eat or drink something when you feel like it . Tiari went on a tour with me to a temple and coffee plantation and even showed me her house/garden including harvesting coconuts ü•• That was very special and I learnt a lot about Indonesian culture that day . Thanks again ! Overall I really enjoyed my stay there and would come back here any time ! I can highly recommend this place :)",This place is exceptionally nice. The rooms are completely new and the view is just wow. You have great views of the jungle and you have even a little terrace. We even met the owner and the philosophy behind this place is that he tries to connect everything to nature and local community. He tries to use local resources and even the pool is gentle to the nature and without chlorine. It‚Äôs an ideal place for reconnecting with nature and spend some quality time! Definitely worth the visit!!,"We had an absolutely fantastic time here!
Fully recommended if you are looking for a jungle experience in contact with locals. The staff was very polite and positive. They did not hesitate to help us (e.g. they helped me with some first aid). The facilities are new, clean and have a gorgeous view to the jungle (plus a small hammock area). The sounds of the jungle at night are soothing. We had no problem moving around with Gojek. There are a couple of excellent home restaurants nearby to discover (the staff at Daydream Lodge can also cook you something). This has been our best stay in Bali. Big thanks!",Slightly outside the hustle and bustle of the city but so relaxing. Amazing staff who are always smiling

Trail is more tedious than from the other side. The view from this side is much better though. Trail appears to suddenly stop in a Rice field. Just follow the little path next to it and you'll find the trail again. Nice little secluded waterfall but nothing special in comparison to all the others.,"‚ÄúTrail‚Äù needs work but is kinda what I expected for the area. Went with a wonderful tour guide, Wayan Purna, who made the experience wonderful by explaining every tree/plant/flower and cultural context. I can give his whatsapp if needed.

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend alone for the first time but it‚Äôs not horrible. Takes normal speed about 2 hours, took me 3 (knee injury)",The best waterfall in tegallalang,Best place ever! And you can buy some fresh fruits! Passion fruit is delicious!,"Trail abruptly ends before waterfall. Pretty hike overlooking terraces and great bird/monkey spotting. Trail needs work and completion toward the end, just after the sign says 120m remaining"

All the spices and flavors, you can taste that our hosts made the food with so much love.
Maasive thanks to Gung Ayik for her hospitality, we would like to come back here again! üôåüèª","Best Babi Guling I‚Äôve ever had in Bali, I have been to at least a dozen Babi Guling warung in Bali , and this is definitely the best of the best , the source is so rich and the ‚Äúsam sam guling ‚Äú it was just amazing !! Lovely view and super friendly staffs , great service and the price is really cheap.

Our car was accidentally stuck in front of the restaurant , their staffs go all the way into the village and ask the village people to help us get our car out without asking anything , we truly appreciate it . We will definitely come back again ‚ù§Ô∏è","Best Babi Guling Samsam I've had in Bali.
Amazing quiet atmosphere with a beautiful view.
The owner is also very nice and accommodating.

Most genuine restaurant experience I've had in Bali.","Lovely restaurant with the most beautiful view on Bali! The food was amazing and the woman and here family were so sweet! She started her restaurant during the Covid and deserves a lot of customers! If you go to the waterfall, definitely stop here and enjoy the real Bali!"

Only a short walk (or very bumpy motorbike ride) down to tangkup waterfall as well üôÇ,"Such a lovely surprise to find this restaurant at the start of the walk to the waterfall. Great views, excellent and friendly service and a great choice of food. They set a table on the lawns overlooking amazing tropical valley, complete with Balinese umbrella and cushions. We could not have planned it better. What a find.","The food was beautifully presented and delicious, very fresh and tasty. The scenery was amazing, so peaceful and lush, and the staff were very kind. Would love to come again, unique eatery and great experience by the waterfall","Such an amazing random place that we found after our water falls journey,
The owners are absolutely amazing and very lovely, we felt very happy there and looking at the amazing and magical views , highly recommend this place and the food there .","We stumbled across this as we headed to the waterfall and didn‚Äôt realise it would be so great. We had a watermelon juice which was fresh and cold! A vanilla milkshake and a vegetarian nasi goreng to share. Everything came to approx 100,000rp (approx $10 Au). The view is stunning, lovely friendly people and the waterfall is a must- we were so glad not many tourists were there. It‚Äôs about a 10-15min hike in and there‚Äôs quite a few stairs plus small precarious hand made bridges . They added to the challenge and charm though and it was worth every minute. Make sure you take change for a donation."
