Also they provide further information around the louwak coffee as well. As the animal was in a cage i felt sorry for her :(

At the end of the tour they provide a tasting plate which doesn’t include local coffee. If you want to taste it you need to pay 50k for female beans and 80k for male beans coffee.

The tasting is done in a nice terrace with beautiful view.","Our “plantation” guide was super detailed in explaining to us about the luwak (pronounced LU-A, ignore the K) coffee as well as the entire coffee making process. If you have any questions just ask.

I liked this place as it offers better views for your coffee tasting. Afterwards you can choose to purchase some from the large shop or not, no pressure. I wish I had the luggage space to purchase some.

Just note that it’s not a true plantation. You walk through what I would consider a small garden with different plants as the guide introduce them to you and tell you about them.","Loved this experience. Had a tour guide walk me through the entrance showing coffee trees, the civit animal, herbs and fruit used and told me everything I needed to know. Then I got to try many different coffees and teas, sitting outside with nice jungle views. I even tried the most expensive coffee in the world, which was yummy. This was one of my favorite activities in Bali! I even bought some coffee and tea to take with me.","We got a short tour through a garden showing some of the plants and types they are growing and using. This was followed by a coffee tasting - All of the coffees were delicious and we spent around 750k Rp on a selection of coffee (Prices: 200k Rp for 200g, 120k Rp for 100g, + little extra for the special cat poop coffee ""Luwak""). I can recommend the coffee also for ""presents"" as they have unusual types like Avocado, Vanilla, or the Luwak coffee.

""Only"" 4 stars as we felt a little rushed during our stay - for the tasting as well as while shopping the coffee.",Tradition meets modernity. The coffee meets the taste center. The diversity meets the uniqueness.The bean hits the feces. The tea hits the heat. All of this meets my joy and happiness. highly recommended

Don't let it deceive you.

* A tourist scam *

A taxi driver said this farm was on my way, later when I checked it was out of my course. I was almost late for the meeting that was in the afternoon which I already shared to the driver.

TOUR : Tour itself was actually good. You get to see different plants like coffee plant, banana, cinnamon, ginseng, turmeric, vanilla, pepper, etc.

TASTING : I am a professional taster. This place added way too much sugar. Tasting was meaningless. It was also unbearable to drink.

UNETHICAL : I understand people need money to survive. However, what I have encountered was a total scam :( If your place was worth a visit, I could have visited and happily pay for the product.

OVER-PRICED: Because I had to be at my schedule on time and couldn't bother to deal with the driver and also Cantik Agriculture as a solo femal traveller, I quickly purchased 50g rosella powder for 120k (that I could've purchased for 20k at somewhere else).

SUGGESTION: Your place and grab drivers need to find a middle ground that can benefit all of the party involved (including a tourist). Otherwise, it will go sour quickly, which will be bad for a business to survive.

* CANTIK AGRICULTURE responses to a low review 'are you sure you visited the right place?' - YES, I VISITED THE RIGHT PLACE THAT WAS GUIDED BY YOU AND THE GRAB DRIVER.

* GRAB VIOLATION : I haven't reported the driver to Grab. However, it is clearly against the policy. Based on other reviews, this already happened multiple times, I can see this malpractice could become a huge issue eventually.","Great service. I met the farmer there, he speaks great English, much better than almost Indonedian I've met. And their coffee tasting zone has the incredible greattttt view.","My partner and I had our first ever Luwak coffee tasting (+ other various coffee and tea tasting) here, and it was an eye-opening experience. There was no pressure to buy any of their coffees at all. And one of the brother staff (he is wearing white t-shirt in my photo attached) was very friendly in explaining the Luwak coffee & other drinks. We even got to try grinding the Luwak coffee beans with the long wooden stick

I ended up buying their Luwak Coffee (for my parents), Avocado Coffee, Bali Coffee & Cocoa, and Mangosteen Tea because those tasted really good to me. I recommend this place if you're nearby!","I had a great time at Cantik Agriculture Luwak Coffee plantation in Bali. It was fascinating to see how this type of coffee is made, and the staff let us taste different varieties before buying. Their hospitality made us buy some coffee to take home, also it had amazing veiws. Highly recommended!","This place is included on some tours to promote their coffee.  The free tasting is excellent although some of the beverages were sickly sweet.

Of course, you feel obliged to purchase some of their products, which I did.  The ginger tea is ok but the Mocha requires a lot more powder per cup than the recommended 2 tablespoons to achieve the creaminess of the sample. Not great value.

The main attraction is to sample coffee made from beans regurgitated by a Civet.  Although you have to pay extra for a sample cup of this coffee.

They had a couple of Civets in a cage but I was assured that the production Civets are left in the wild.

The worst part of the experience was being harassed by aggressive vendors in the car park before we left."

We also got to taste test 7 chocolate flavours. It was a wonderful experience. Thank you for having us.","We had a guided tour around Ubud and stopped here to taste different flavors of coffee and tea. Really worth while to stop here, they have so many options to taste! We brought a lot of their nice teas and coffees home.","Fantastic experience. Our guide told us about plantation and showed us all the plants they have. We taste tested all the coffees they have in small shop.
The prices for coffee in a gift shop can be considered high but in this place they hand pick luwak coffee from wild and take care of injured animals so I'll pay for that.","Overall it was ok, liked the mangosteen tea and Rosella tea, otherwise the coffee is not particularly to my taste, too sweet for my liking.  The stroll before the coffee tasting was nice with decent (although not spectacular) view.","Nowadays every tour agency stops at these fake ""coffee plantation"" shops. Because the tour guide gets commission on sales.

However, not having transparent ingredients listed on their teas, coffee mixes, etc, is a red flag.

Nowhere in the developed world will they get away with selling packaged products, at twice the price of supermarket, yet with no ingredient labels.

Yet, you still buy, because its a rushed decision with the free testers upfront to make you feel ""indebted"".

Insist on only buying stuff with full written ingredient disclosure on the product. Otherwise you encourage this 3rd world type of business practice where you're not allowed to know whats in your food. A recipe for disease & allergies: Chemical powdered creamers, weird undisclosed sweeteners which could even be ""aspartame"" or other nasty chemicals as it says ""sugar-free"", preservatives, etc. All hidden from you as consumer.

Most people probably end up throwing away whatever they buy here. I threw away the tea I bought here, and got an organic natural alternative at Sayuri in Ubud (with full ingredient disclosure - 1 ingredient - on packaging. At less than half the price.)

I add below the real grocery store cost of e.g. Avocado coffee. Its 10K Idr. Thus, don't be tempted to pay 120k Idr for this trash. (Don't even ask about the chemical ingredients in this ""avocado coffee"" below. Its really bad for you.)"

The staff is very informative and friendly. This Plantation had really great Cassava chips which were a welcomed surprise and we got two bags at their store because they are so good. Their store also has chocolate, oils and other little goodies. I was elated to find the oils I wanted. I always get the Bali Flower and Vanilla oils because they smell so good on my skin. An over all must if you want to learn more about Balinese Coffee and tea. (This helps make it easier to buy coffee in grocery stores too)","Great stop to explore the coffee and cocoa plantation. In the end, you will have coffee & tea tasting with plenty of samples. You can also buy souvenirs from here if you like.","What a great, unique experience. Although the tour and tastings were free, Devayu (my guide) was incredibly patient, talking me through the entire process from growing to packaging coffee, the various types of coffee plants grown in Bali, other produce (herbs, spices) as well as the infamous luwak coffee. I was warned of various famous coffee plantations (down the road) actually being mega tourist traps with drivers getting commissions off bringing customers there and was looking for a more authentic experience. That’s exactly what I got here! I sat down and tried 16 (!!) different types of teas and coffee, each one more delicious than the other while chatting away with Devayu as she so sweetly described life in Bali. I felt like I was drinking coffee with a real friend ❤️ If I were you, I wouldn’t hesitate about visiting this place!","Good experience, very knowledgeable guide who explained everything properly and with patience. was not happy with the Civet sleeping in the cage as they did say they release after 2 weeks but God knows. peaceful and calm place to spend an hour or so. did have the swing also on the lower level. A lookout at the back over looking the field. most coffee plants had coffees growing as well.
Sampled various Flavor types of Tea, Coffee & Hot Chocolates

Souvenir place is a bit expensive. small coffee or tea were 130k or $13 AUD.","One of the most uninspiring sales pitches I have come across.
Don’t be fooled, this place is merely a setup to sell you instant tea or coffee. You will be shown the bare minimum of the coffee production process and very few coffee plants. After minutes you will be sat down to try a selection of sugary beverages (only one without sugar is the Bali coffee). None of which tasted particularly interesting. Afterwards you will be guided to the shop to make a purchase. They also keep one of the animals that ferment the famous coffee beans close - this may be the only highlight of the shop.

Not worth a visit."
