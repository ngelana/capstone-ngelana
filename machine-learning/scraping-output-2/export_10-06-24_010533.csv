There was other people's piss left on the toilet when I arrived. It's super noisy also, with windows that don't close properly, a blind that is just held there with velcro. Only positive thing I have to say is that the staff are friendly, kind and helpful","Comfy bed, no tissue at The toilet So carry it by yourself. They have Refrigerator in The room, Qibla direction information oN The desk. Free coffee, tea, hot water and microwife near The lobby. Free 2 bottles mineral water 330ml in The room.","Awesome value for money. The rooms are spacious and the hotel is really big with old classic balinese elements. The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. They helped me copy and print everything I needed for immigration. There is coffee, tea and bread in the morning.

The guys at the desk were super friendly and helpful,  5 stars for service. We couldn't find the hotel but we called them and they gave us directions.
Good value for money. I just needed somewhere to crash for one night, and it was fine. Location wise, I'm not too sure, as I didn't spend any time in Denpasar, I was just passing through, so I can't really comment.","We had a room booked and they cancelled our room 5 minutes before the check in time. We didn't have anywhere to go and they insisted that we pay again for the same room even if we didn't know if we would get the money back. So we basically were paying double for the same room I would never recommend, there are other options with similar or even cheaper prices near that are better.
We also stayed there for a night before, the room was dirty, the floor sticky, the bed sheets and pillows were dirty and smelled awful, and the toilet was very unclean. All the place has a very strong smell of humidity which makes the stay even more uncomfortable.",Nice for budget backpackers. But the room was moldy,"The exteriors are beautiful and gives out a heritage vibe. However, we weren‚Äôt so happy with our rooms. The bathroom door didn‚Äôt lock, so we had to manage workarounds in there. The AC wasn‚Äôt cooling properly, so we felt pretty warm in the night, but were too tired, so slept anyway. The receptionist was welcoming.","Already tried 6 different rooms. Well, here I said friends, but actually with a kid of friend, we brought a family.

The first two rooms are good, full facilities with TV, refrigerator, water heater, clean room and bathroom, hot shower.
The second two, we experienced bad services. One of both bathroom was too moist and uncomfortable, but all toilet exhaust had no active fan. The water heater was dirty, cannot be cleaned, so we borrowed the other room. We also asked broom for our room, they said they will bring it to our room later. The most disappointing is that they did not bring any broom until we checked out and no apology. Only later after we checked out, then talked about why our  request was unfinished. They said they were too busy. How disappointing service.
But we still have the trust for third two, these rooms more like the first two, but the sink broken. Water drain was stuck, then later the faucet dropped no water.

So these rooms are mixed, better try to check the room first. Even staff are nice, the service is not really good.

Other than room facility, there are pools, water refill, and meeting room.

Pools have one shallow and another one with varies depth. I'd say this not good for swimming for its small but for enjoy playing water or just view nearby the pool. These pools near the meeting room.

Water refill facility can be found in meeting room. The only one work is cold water. The hot water option is broken, but we should've heater in our room.

Meeting room is just a place near pools, full of tables and chairs. I saw a group of people using the place from around 8 am to 1 pm, there is lunch for them. Try ask staff for this facility."

This place was a true hidden gem back then, but it seemed like they haven't really back on their feet after those hard times.

The last time I was there, many of the menus are unavailable and the platter I ordered had a few items substituted because apparently they also run out of condiments.

It's definitely sad to see one of my favorite cafes in Denpasar in this state. Made many friends and had many beautiful memories here. Hope they able to immediately be better.","Okay the minus side is their interior was designed in economical budget, least comfy than other cafe around Kuta and Seminyak area.

The pork skin is not as crunchy as it should be, the other elements are so so. Might be back but i wont crave for this one for sure.","My friend recommended to try eating Nasi Babi Guling at this place instead of eating at other depots which are relatively better known.

After I tried the flavors offered, they were very tasty & more authentic, typical of Bali, even though they were a bit spicy. Must Try.

Especially the pork skin, so crispy and not hard.If you don't like it too spicy, don't forget to inform at the beginning to serve it not spicy (although it will still be served a bit spicy). Prices are also friendlier.

There are 2 entrance locations with 1 fairly limited parking location and 1 relatively wider parking location but access to this location is further away. The road to the depot location is quite challenging because the road can only be passed by 1 car so if you run into another car it will be quite challenging.

The room is not air conditioned but quite cool. There is a special Pig's Ear menu that must be ordered before 11.00 if you don't want to run out.

How to order :
1. come to the storefront location
2. state your order
3. Sit at the available table
4. Food will be delivered to your table
5. make payments at the cashier by cash / cashless
