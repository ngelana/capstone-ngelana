We sat outside and were able to feed the fish!

The food was incredible, and well explained! I have a nut allergy and my friend is vegetarian and Sima, our waitress, was clearly able to explain what each of us could have.

The alcoholic drinks were nice and strong :) great value for money!",Our private driver Mr. Black took us to this lovely restaurant next to a beautiful rice field this evening. It was a prefect setting to admire the beautiful view while enjoying some delicious authentic Balinese cuisine. The service was excellent. Our sever Andika was friendly and attentive. My family absolutely enjoyed our dining experience at this restaurant.,"A charismatic elegant rural restaurant. Cicadas accompany the sound of Kenny G playing gently over the speaker, in a half-open restaurant that lets the summer breeze in (at night).

The menu has western choices (steak, lamb chop, Caesar salad) and local dishes to cater for a bigger crowd. We enjoyed the local dishes and the prices were reasonable. The fresh juice mix was especially refreshing.

Sri and her colleagues helped tend to our table and their service was excellent. Not too intrusive and just the right amount of attention.

All things considered this is a five star experience for the price.

You‚Äôre welcome.","Came here for lunch after  touring temples and rice fields. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised by how lovely this open restaurant is with their multi-level dining areas and beautiful view of the fields.

Vera was our server and she was friendly, attentive, and very helpful.

We ordered the mi goreng kampoeng (noodles with satay skewers), iga bakar babi (pork ribs), and their famous teba sari (crispy duck). Everything was so incredibly good especially the crispy duck.

You have to stop here to try their food and when taking a break in the area. You won't regret it!","Amazing atmosphere, very relaxing  and peaceful, fantastic food, great cocktails. Our waitress Ari was very friendly,  attentive and polite. Highly recommend."

The venue, service and food - all impeccable.
The food is very creative and unusual. Even my nephew who is not very adventurous when it comes to new flavors and unusual combinations appreciated it. I guess people who are seeking a fine dining experience but with more traditional ingredients and flavors should go elsewhere, but those who do not mind exploring, experimenting and are open minded - definitely will be blown away!
It was almost three hour experience, with 20 or something dishes and paired drinks which by the way beautifully supplemented and transformed the flavors of the dishes.
It was my 3rd time dining at Locavore (first time in the new venue), and get super impressed every time.","A captivating, unforgettable end-to-end experience.

Every detail is painstakingly designed to inspire and delight - from the narrow vine-lined driveway and stunning industrial architecture, to the thoughtful curation of Indonesian antiques contrasted against futuristic computer displays and quirky contemporary art. The service is outstanding (warmth and smiles all around), lighting and music are perfect (think Radiohead, Beach House, etc) and the food is simply superb, taking you on a journey of innovative local flavors across 20 courses and 10 beverages.

Locavore NXT is full of surprises and delights, and unlike any fine dining experience I have had before. I would highly recommended taking the first seating at 6pm to be able to watch the sunset over the paddy fields while having your welcome drinks and snacks at the NXT bar.","Our dining experience was truly exceptional and unforgettable. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, the service exceeded our expectations. The staff were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, making us feel welcomed and valued throughout our meal.

As for the food, it was nothing short of amazing. Each dish was expertly prepared, bursting with flavor and presented beautifully. From appetizers to desserts, every bite was a delight to the senses. The chef's creativity and attention to detail truly shone through in every aspect of the meal.

Overall, we would confidently rate our experience a remarkable 11 out of 10. It surpassed our expectations in every way and left us eager to return for another extraordinary culinary journey.","I was greeted with open arms by the locals, whose warmth and hospitality made my stay truly memorable. From the moment I arrived, it felt like home away from home. The locals' welcoming nature not only enhanced my experience but also left a lasting impression on me. Daniel , the reservation manager was so great in what he does accommodate us very well and took us for the first part of the introduction. He showed us not only the exterior of the building but also the spirit of it.
One of the highlights of my trip was undoubtedly the food. Every meal was a culinary delight, showcasing the richness and diversity of the local ingredients . From traditional flavours like jamu in their juice pairings bursting with flavor to innovative twists on the things that they grow in their farm and available around them, each bite was a revelation. The head beverage program Marina was absolutely amazing in her own craft sharing session and session on her inspiration and ideas backbone on how she paired the food with her beverages for the night. Putri, the restaurant manager was also a star during our meal. Checking in with us from time to time making sure we are relax and comfortable and created the sense of belonging in her house ‚ÄúLocavore ‚Äú the warm and comfortable feeling unlike any restaurant. It‚Äôs an evident that the locals take great pride in their culinary heritage, and their passion shines through in every dish and service.
What sets Locavore apart is its commitment to preserving and promoting local‚Äôs crafts, spirit , culture and passion in food. Despite the growing influence of global cuisine, there's a strong emphasis on keeping the food authentically local. One of their key member Aka ‚ÄúBoss ‚Äú brought us for a foraging trip. He showed us how important and different an ingredients taste like if the plant is happy in its original environment instead of growing in a capitalism destructive environment. This dedication in maintaining culinary traditions is commendable and adds a unique dimension to the dining experience. He showed us how importance it is to have control in what we do in a restaurant even if is just a tiny gesture.

What struck me most during my time in Locavore was the fighting spirit embedded in the community's efforts to localize food. I personally felt in loved with the whole team that treated us and took care of us for the nights we spend here.

Despite challenges, there's a palpable sense of determination to preserve and elevate local cuisine. It's this resilience and passion that make Locavore a culinary destination like no other.
In conclusion, my experience here was nothing short of extraordinary. The combination of warm hospitality, sensational food, and a commitment to local culinary traditions makes it a must-visit destination for food lovers and travelers alike. I left with a full stomach and a heart full of gratitude, already longing to return for another taste of this culinary paradise and hospitality .

Continue to change the world!!!","I honestly don‚Äôt know where to begin. This was without a doubt the greatest dining experience of my life. From the welcome, to the venue, to the staff, to the drinks pairing so perfecting with the most incredible meals, I cannot fault a single thing. Not only is the attention to detail absolutely out of this world, the whole team brought it together so well and it flowed beautifully.
My last ‚Äòbest meal‚Äô was the original locavore, but NXT knocked it out of the park.
A huge thank you to the team and Chef Eelke for making this the best anniversary. We can‚Äôt wait to come back and hopefully stay in the woodrooms ü§ç"

During my stay, I encountered the following problems:

Internet connection: The internet connection was extremely poor. It was impossible to surf the internet, and I couldn't communicate with anyone unless I had mobile data or a local SIM card.

Bathroom: The bathroom was quite frightening for my wife as it was open to the outdoor seating area, with many trees inside. We even encountered several insects."

You can see the different levels of experience of the artists and the different qualities of the paintings.  Many many styles are represented here.

The opening prices are high but you can settle to about 30% discount.

I'd recommend this place to anyone with different tastes in painting and different thicknesses of your wallet.  There is something for everyone","Best Art Gallery in Bali!

The service was impeccable and the range of art covered every style and size so there is something for all tastes and budgets in a chilled no pressure setting. This place is bursting with art with many rooms to explore. Prices are also reasonable, however like everywhere in Bali, be prepared for a little negotiation.

If you like art, come here. Even if you think you don‚Äôt like art, come here. These guys are the best!","A must visit gallery when in Bali. I must say the paintings are all amazing. The agent told us that some paintings would take months to make and the one that caught my eye was made by a famous Indonesian artist. It cost around
USD 6000. The gallery paintings are composed by different individuals so the variety is big. My eyes had a feast looking at each pieces.

What a happy place it was for me to be!

I have tried almost everything on the menu and loved it all, good prices and healthy options. Due to limited seating can be busy but worth being patient. Thank you for the lovely food ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè","Was recommended this place by our driver from our Mount Batur sunrise hike and this place did not disappoint! The location is along one of the main roads heading into central Ubud, so it can be a bit noisy from the traffic, but don‚Äôt let that deter you from delicious food and organic juice. It is a cute shack with limited seating, but they also offer takeaway. The prices were favorable making the food/juice have great value.

We ordered the jamu juice, banana/mango/pineapple smoothie, and the banana/avocado/dragon fruit smoothie from the juice and smoothie menu. Our favorite was the banana/mango/pineapple smoothie, as it was fluffy, smooth and delicious. For food, we ordered the chicken satay, fried rice with chicken, fried noodle with chicken and the Balinese pancake. They were all so good making it hard to pick a favorite. The fried rice and the fried noodle had the best flavor that we have had so far in Ubud for those dishes. We really enjoyed the peanut sauce with the chicken satay. We usually order a banana pancake at other restaurants, but the Balinese pancake is far superior‚Ä¶ it is topped with coconut shreds and drizzled with what tasted like a palm sugar syrup, so it had a good mix of sweet and savory. The pancake was also green in color, indicating that there was pandan used in it and made for nice presentation and flavor.

I would highly recommend trying this restaurant, even if it is just for the juice. Overall great experience here and we left with full belly‚Äôs.","The ambiance is casual and welcoming, with a bright and energetic vibe that makes it a great spot for a quick health boost or a leisurely sip.","A small and cozy place with a basic menu typical of Bali but made with love. More than reasonable prices for such delicious food and juices. Cons:  Missing vegan options and is a bit noisy,  because it‚Äôs too close to the main road.","Lovely place with affordable prices.
Delicious smoothies and nice breakfast options (I took waffles and pancakes), it was really ü§§. My friends had sandwiches and also were happy.

Our room we payed for was with a fan but the fan run so slow that there was literally no airflow in the room. There‚Äôs like two big window walls.

Nice pool.
Feel like they could do more with the lobby area but no complaints.","I didn't want to write this but the owner's actions left me no choice. Firstly, the location. It's not actually near Ubud. it's about another 30 minutes drive away. There is nothing nearby to do or good to eat. Secondly, the room. the bathroom is not separated from the room so whatever revolting things occur in there is shared with the rest of the room. mmm yummy! Calling it a pool is generous when it's more of a 4 person bath. mmm cosy. Last, the room we purchased came included an air conditioner in the room features but once we arrived we were informed that the AC was going to cost an additional $10 while the room cost only $9. The room comes with a 'fan' but i have felt more air come from Chinese dollar shop fan than this one. When it looks like a SCAM and smells like a SCAM, its usually a SCAM. selling cheap rooms then once you arrive, charging double just to be able to breathe in the 33 degree heat is a shady practice at the least. Once we called the owner we were informored again just because an AC is listed in the rooms features, doesnt mean its included. By that same logic, would we have to pay to use the bed? or the bathroom? it didnt matter because we left after an hour of negoting and expected to recieve my refund, which i never did.

The gardens as shown on the website and marketing are only available to the private guests of the 4 bedroom villa. The location and surroundings of this ""resort"" is lacklustre as is the food. I have stayed in a wide range of accommodation all over Bali, and the breakfast and other food at this ""resort"" was comparatively the poorest quality. Staff also do not respond well to requests or feedback unless it falls within the narrow bandwidth of services they offer. in-house massages are relatively expensive as are the charged trips to Ubud Central. Note: there is little to see/visit within the vicinity of the villa and traffic from south Ubud to Ubud Central was highly congested.  The positive features include the rustic charm of the ""villa"", the comfort of the bed and the temperature of the pool. Overall, I would not stay here again; better value and service is available elsewhere. The marketing and photos particularly relating to the garden setting are highly misleading.","I love this place! The one bedroom villa has a beautiful pool with soothing sound of the  fountain. I found the room lacking light, for my taste. The outdoor space was pretty spacious. The outdoor bathroom I loved and was spacious. Breakfast was good and prepared in house, with a good variety to choose daily. However dinner had to be booked 3 hours ahead, do I bought or eat out before returning to the hotel. The staff on call were great, very accommodating and friendly. Location us a but of a challenge unless you have a bike. It's not close to the shops and eatery, so I used the local staff or Gojek app for rides.",Wonderful stay. Family friendly accomodation. Stayed with our nearly 2 year old son. Staff were always available to help and organised everything we ask for. Our son loved seeing the chooks and feeding the fish with the staff. Villa was comfortable and had a lovely garden and pool area.,Incredible hidden gem. We stayed in Puri Tupai as two couples with 2 children each- perfect set up with 4 bedrooms split in separate villas but adjoining. The garden is HUGE and has the WOW factor... Pool stunning. Only minor comment was the breakfast could be improved but service always friendly and lots of amazing restaurants within a short taxi ride. Highly recommend,Love the villa especially the 4 rooms with huge garden and pool. If only the tree house is safe for kids to go up. Service is good üëç. Can improve on the food and walk paths outside villas that leads to reception. Can be slippery!

I had visited previously and asked if it's ok to have breakfast and swim in the pool and was told yes. I also confirmed when I entered again this time to have breakfast that I was told previously I was welcome to have breakfast and haven't a swim. After a rather disatisfying breakfast that wasn't as described on the menu we went to jump in the pool quickly before leaving. The owner approached us and said that we needed to pay 50k to swim in the pool. I explained my previous conversation to which he replied well I'm the owner and saying that you need to pay to use the pool. The pool area smelt like dog poo so I guess all round we are not disappointed that we won't be going back.,"The best villa in Ubud. A little far away from the center of city but very cozy and quiet.

Thank you for making my stay a beautiful one. üôè‚ú®Ô∏è","-the best stays we have ever been!
they took care of us in every way possible, from the airport to our stays and trips! They also gave us precious tips from locals and made our days in Ubud way more enjoyable and easy thanks to their drivers service and guide through all the popular (and non!) attractions. All the stuff are amazing and very kind, willing to honestly help you!
-also there is always some in the reception willing to help you at anytime!

-about the villa:
the villas are really beautiful and the pool even more! also everything is really private. even if the bathroom is outside of the room it was not a problem and also had an amazing bathtub!
- the outside is very decorated and beautiful!
-the breakfast they made is delicious. you get to choose every day what you want  from a good list, typical and non.
-we found really helpful that there was a full gallon of drinkable water in the kitchen! (with cold and hot water)
-there is also a water boiler with cup and tea

-about service
the driver service is STUNNING. Kindest guide and people we‚Äôve ever met
-from here you can literally book EVERYTHING and staff will help you a lot with every info that you will need and suggest you even better options than you thought of.

for summary,
recommended 10/10
(we will definitely come back!!)
thank you for everything lestaru villa! ‚ù§Ô∏è","What a fabulous place to stay, very quiet, well located, Noni has looked after us. No problems, and I highly recommend staying here. Wonderful and helpful team.","Amazing place! We absolutely loved it, this private villa is something everyone needs for a perfect vacation. We enjoyed all breakfast, bathtub and pool.
Having kitchen with a tank of drinking water was something we appreciated a lot.
Staff was friendly, very helpful and spoke english very well.
We also rented a scooter here from the manager. Wifi was working perfectly.
We went to Mount Batur hike so they prepared for us breakfast the previous day so we could eat something before.
Once we are back in Bali we will definitely come back to Villa Lestaru. Thank you very much for your hospitality and kindness!","Lovely traditional villa with your own pool. Outside covered in toilet and shower complete with plants was beautiful. This could be a downside for some people as you have to walk down stairs and go outside of the building.
This place was special because of the staff. Putu and Indra are two special young people who try to help you with every request...including quietly leaving me extra tissues when they heard me sneezing alot. The towels have stains on them so that's off putting...bring your own.  You need to have transport to ubud cbd...about 10 minutes.
A restaurant is near this place is very nice and they will come and pick you up. Gorgeous views over the rice fields here. Breakfast is OK delivered to your room...about 7 choices."

The property is located in a quiet part of Ubud so you still have access to Ubud center without the noise and chaos! Sometimes there can be a bit of traffic build when you exit onto the Main Street but that is just life in Ubud!

Did I mention how lovely it was to have a private pool with a smaller one for the kids?

Sometimes Grab cannot find the location on the map so just putting Abhirama spa as the location usually solved the problem.
