The way there goes through a picturesque village with pretty friendly local people there. You can ask them for direction.

The path down to this air terjun is steep and narrow, but good enough for a bike, just need to be careful. You'll probably meet a man who owns this territory and has built that path. There is no entrance fee. You'll see some gazebo not far from the waterfal as well.

Good to come here in dry season, when the water is more clear.

You can stop by a pile of coconuts on the way there or back, and get one for 2000-3000 rupiah only.",Beautiful waterfall to swim in - nobody there except locals. The very steep path goes down to the right. Just ask!,Couldnâ€™t find the waterfall,,
