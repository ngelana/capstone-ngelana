Although it takes me 2 hours to arrive here, I will definitely visit this nature's beauty frequently.. Even, I plan to visit this place much earlier so that I can save lots of time to spend here..

The surrounding environment here, consisting of densely green vegetation, serene canyon behind the natural pool, and its crystal emerald water, is what I truly love from this beautiful gem.. It takes 30k for each visitor to unlock this nature's beautiful blessing..","So, I stumbled upon Blue Lagoon in Buleleng, Bali, and it's basically my new happy place. The vibe is chill, and the views? Total jaw-droppers. Snorkeling there is like entering an underwater wonderland, and if you're more of a beach bum, they've got you covered too. Honestly, it's the kind of spot you wanna keep to yourself, but hey, good things are meant to be shared. So, if you're Bali-bound, Blue Lagoon is a no-brainer for some serious good times. üèùÔ∏èüê†","You can enjoy the view but the hiking is difficult with unbalanced stares. According to the locals there is no way to go there, but only when you pay entry fees that costs 125k to 500k depending on what hike you choose.
The waterfalls are great and the water is freezing but you will forget the hike when you get up there.","!SCAM!
Dont read these reviews because the place is totally not worth it.
25k/p for entry
350k for a guide
You are NOT allowed to swim in the blue lagoon without a guide (and they wont give you life jackets if you dont have a guide), which is a total scam since the lagoon itself is not unsafe, even after rain. Youre NOT allowed to go to see the rest of 3 waterfalls without a guide because there is a ‚Äúriver crossing‚Äù which yes, maybe some people do need extra pair of hands if they come from a country that has no such thing as river crossing and are not used to hiking but some people are more experienced and 350k is a funny price for a local guide that probably doesn‚Äôt even have any rescue certificates if something is actually supposed to happen to you.
I‚Äôm all for following local rules so I ofcourse respected the ‚Äúno swim‚Äù and ‚Äúno river crossing‚Äù without a guide, but I totally don‚Äôt recommend visiting this place just to see the blue lagoon.
Peace and love ‚úåüèº","incredible and beautiful waterfalls. Definitely go with a guide and see the beautiful waterfalls, try their activities and have a lot of fun! Our guide was very nice and helpful.

The activities:
- swing out over water in blue lagoon
- 3-4 meter natural cliff slide
- 8 meter natural cliff slide (very thrilling)
- 3 meter jump
-  10 meter jump
- 15 meter jump

Everything is of course optional but we recommend the slides at least. Those were very fun."

The scenery is very good and the staff is very friendly.

Unfortunately, when we came it was raining, so we were unable to try the activities. Will come again next time to try it out","A favorite restaurant in this city! Cleanest restaurant we have been to in Bali. The whole time we ate, 5 or so employees were sweeping and picking up items around the the property. This restaurant is part of the Krisna Adventures. We came here after Bob‚Äôs Trekking adventure. Located right next to Aling Aling waterfalls - the one with the waterfall slide (a must try, it‚Äôs nerve wrecking but totally safe!)

Soto Ayam (Chicken soup) was a big portion, served with a heaping mound of rice. Sate Ayam (Barbecue Chicken on a stick) also had a big portion of chicken with peanut sauce, also served with rice. Their chili sauces are super spicy! If you like it hot, ask them for ‚ÄòCabe.‚Äô I got their water spinach (kankung) with chili sauce on top and by the end of our meal, Matt and I were sweating from the heat. Felt amazing. Our stomachs were just fine the next day as well, tells me their food is very fresh and prepared well.

They have both Indonesian and Western cuisine alongside an extensive dessert menu.

The views are incredible as you enjoy your meal. Koi fish are plentiful in the surrounding pond. You cross a brilliant red/orange bridge over a natural river as you walk from the restaurant to the parking lot.

Credit cards accepted. The prices for the food, quality and quantity are exceptional.","Big and spacious dining area surrounded by pond, grass and adventure activities. We order Soto Ayam, Ayam Lada Hitam (black peppered chicken), orange juice and small bintang. It costs us Rp130.000 with taxes and service charge.

The food was tasty and service was good. The Soto Ayam has noodles in it and it comes with a plate of rice. Good if you are hungry.",Spent my day doing numerous activities for a cheap price. They also provided variety of foods and drinks. You can also watch the sun sets from their restaurant.,"Good place to hangout with your friends or family, the views are so beautiful, but access to the waterfall was closed!"
