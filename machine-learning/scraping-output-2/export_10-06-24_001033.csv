The food and beverage are very affordable and imo are quite good.

The motorcycle parking is quite challenging but there are a lot of spaces available.

No minimum order for any type of seatings.","It's out of all my expectations, the sight is wonderful till Im thinking that the owner had decided to choose great locations to open the business,, the food was delicious with great service,, would definitely come back again in another time,","Beautiful location
Delicious food and drinks
Friendly, helpful staff
Able to pay by card which is useful
Impressed by how well they maintain the stunning area including gardening","It's a mixed experience visiting this natural restaurant. The ambiance is so pleasant and relaxing as it's located nearby the river with lots of greenery and beautiful plants. Suitable to visit with family and friends, the seating is so comfortable with different level and type of table. Perfect to take pictures. Food tastes so good as we order grilled chicken with condiment and sauce. Very reasonable for the price without additional tax and service.

Yet, there are still things to improve! Seating is sometimes wet when it's raining so need to choose wisely for the location. Their service is so slow and quite unresponsive. Staffs don't work effectively therefore our order was served quite long time. For the beverage, we ordered Lime Tea and Lychee Squash, but it was so plain, barely any flavor or sweetness inside. The table wasn't properly clean as they didn't pick up the dirty dishes immediately from the previous visitors. Please pay attention to the cleanliness!","A lovely place by the river, surrounded by lush greeneries and some waterfalls.

The food is good though limited in options with resonable price.

The staff are friendly and attentive, and service is quite fast.

Would be better if they don't have speakers playing pop music."
