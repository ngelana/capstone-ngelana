Just be prepared with your stamina in going back because of the heights with 159 steps..although it constructed with a good timing stop to rest..but it is worth the climb.,"We hired a scooter and went exploring and found this hidden gem amongst rural streets, and rice paddies. Absolutely stunning with crystal clear waters and a very short walk from parking area. Highly recommended.","Lovely waterfall located not far from Ubud, Bali. The journey their takes you through lovely local ricefields. I would recommend taking a scooter there. The waterfall is situation in a lush tropical canyon. It is less known than other waterfalls making it great place to escape the crowds.","Temesi waterfall located at eastern  part of ubud, 30 minute drive from ubud. View is Hiddden canyon with easy access to Waterfall.
Also we can jumping from the rock and swimming.  So if you looking for waterfall just come to #temesiwaterfall","Beautiful waterfall, there was an easy path to walk down well worth the visit"
