There is golf course near there",Thank you for your welcoming service!,"Brand new Villas with ocean view with an unique architecture, artsy common area and it feels like you enter a new tropical zone in Kampi. A hidden place to stay ‚ô•Ô∏è",Lovely and cozy place to stay. Not far from Nusa Dua and Pandawa Beach. Amazing and mesmerising ocean view.

Staying here second time. Paul and Caroline always react to any problem same day , staff always welcome. Special thanks to Charlie. Reading bad reviews: If you waiting that it will be Hilton - pay Hilton price!!Best regards from Viktorsüëã","I saw the negative reviews mostly because they didn‚Äôt like the dog‚Äôs bark
Well, I‚Äôm a dog person & I do not mind dog‚Äôs bark. It‚Äôs actually beautiful to find a place where you can see many dogs around. This place is very nice with affordable price. Come on please all the negative comments, you need to check your WALLET ATTITUDE too. Looks like you complained to a luxurious mega hotel with super expensive price. Bear in your mind, it‚Äôs Nusa Dua, everywhere there, is mostly more expensive than any other part in Bali. In my opinion the price already worth it the place & the service for people who want need budget.","THE ONWER PAUL IS VERY RUDE

I booked a villa through a platform and requested to change the dates. However, the owner, Paul, was extremely rude when he told me that my credit card was not confirmed. Despite me contacting customer service who confirmed that my card was fine, he still went ahead and booked the villa for the day before my booking without any prior notice.

I was shocked at how he treated me, especially since my card had already been confirmed. When I asked him to cancel the booking, he refused even though he had already booked the villa.","The customer service is really worse and there don't understand your situations if you are in any difficulty. They focus only on the money and not the service. Instead of this, you can go to any villa/hotel that is running by bali people. You can't expect any help/service from them. I recommend not to stay here unless you want to ruin your holidays.","Whilst we did enjoy our stay at Villa Anjing 2 there are a few things I would've like to have known before my stay:
Pros:
Villa Anjing literally translates to ""Dog Villa"". If you like dogs there's plenty of them here.
The room was spacious and comfortable with a desk area and good air conditioning.
The gardens are pretty and you fall asleep to the sounds of nature.
The cleaning staff are excellent and friendly and clean the room every day.
You can rent a scooter from the property.
The manager, Doddy was always pleasant.
Some restaurants in the area offer a free collection & drop off service: W Gourmet, The Woodshack and Nyugmen Beer Garden.
Gojek also delivers takeaways to Villa Anjing 2.
Paul, the owner, was available on WhatsApp if we had any questions.
Water dispensers provided clean drinking water.
There are numerous beautiful beaches within driving distance.
Cons:
The 300m stretch from the main road to the villa is appalling. It's completely broken and incredibly bumpy. Cars shouldn't drive it for fear of getting stuck and bikes risk punctures.
The address given to us on Airbnb was for 'Villa Anjing', not 'Villa Anjing 2' so we were not where we thought we would be staying.
If you book transfers from Villa Anjing 2 be sure to emphasize the ""2"". Three separate drivers went to the wrong villa and couldn't find Villa Anjing 2.
The location is not within walking distance of anything so you need a scooter or some mode of transport. It's a 10 minute drive into Nusa Dua and 20 minutes to Uluwatu.
There's no breakfast or laundry service available.
The swimming pool was murky and at times, completely green.
Our booking said we had a kitchen. We did not. We had a sink, fridge and water dispenser. We were told we could use the shared kitchen that had a stove. One of the two rings worked. The kitchen was very dirty and not hygienic, I didn't feel comfortable cooking in it. The pots had no handles and the teatowel wasn't changed for 10 days.
There was a tree that leeked massive amounts of sap just outside our terrace that had a very bad smell, thus making our terrace unusable, unfortunately.
Whilst we really liked the dogs at Villa Anjing they liked to sit on the seating area on our terrace, so the seating didn't smell great and was covered in dog hair.
The entire complex needs some TLC to make it more comfortable and appealing to guests.

I would use Villa Anjing 2 for a couple of nights to explore Nusa Dua & Uluwatu. I wouldn't go back for an extended relaxing, carefree stay - which is what we were looking for."
