Ordered some fried rice for lunch with fried egg on top and it was tasty. The two ladies at the Warung were so friendly and we had a lovely chat about the local culture and traditions and talk a bit about the local weaving at the village.

The two ladies were very informative about their village.","Extremely tasty home cooking. I got the Fried Rice Chicken and Cap Cay which I combined. The result was delicious.

The amount of spice was perfect for me but if don't like spice I suggest you say so when ordering.","Love itüòä great local food, super nice people and kids!

It's a religious cave temple for local people.

The road is so bad, a local leader offered to take me to the cave for free by scooter. Unbelievable how good people are. They didn't even ask for a donation, I had to ask if I can make one, love it. This is what I call an authentic local experience.","Not a tourist attraction‚Ä¶
Just a cave - road there is very difficult and it‚Äôs used for religious purposes I believe",,,
