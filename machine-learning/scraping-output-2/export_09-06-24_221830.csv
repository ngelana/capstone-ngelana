The food is just exquisite. I had the best calamari I‚Äôve ever eaten, perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. There was nothing amiss, everything about this dinner was flawless. We had such a wonderful time, thank you for making this night so special!","The. Best. Restaurant. In. Northern Bali.

Food is amazing, atmosphere very tropical and intimate, staff is very kind and attentive.
We discovered this place by accident and glad we did. Came here immediately the next day to try other dishes. Happy we did, amazing experience. Highly highly recommended!

On top of this, for intolerances the menu has some gluten free options and the spicy level can be adjusted to none if there are such requests.

Final note to the pick up service they offer around Lovina, its a very convenient way to get into the restaurant.","This hidden gem is absolutely awesome!!!
Set in a beautiful garden, hidden away from the main bustle of Lovina, yet incredibly easy to get to.
The staff were welcoming and attentive, and they all really were amazing people!!!
It was a very nice touch to have mosquito repellent by each table, as being an outdoor venue, there is always going to be exposure to some of the wildlife. That said, we had a very peaceful experience with no bites, lol.
There was a great selection of food on offer, and everything we ordered was fresh, tasty, and presented impeccably. It massively exceeded my expectations!!!
One bit of advice I would give is to book in advance to come here!!!
Being in a garden, there are 5 tables, and with it being such an awesome and unique dining experience, this is not really a place that you can just walk in and eat.
The food was all very reasonably priced, and the desserts and cocktails were to die for.
My only regret is that I only got to eat here the one time due to my short stay in Lovina.
However, I do intend on returning very soon and sampling some more beautiful dishes.","A magical garden not far from Lovina Beach. You‚Äôll find fresh, local produce magicked into delicious dishes served by courteous staff who are clearly proud of their restaurant. We had a Bali Lady cocktail (so good), a glass of chardonnay (Two Islands), beer, spring roll entree to share, seafood curry, fish perkedel and black sticky rice pudding. We spent Rp790k and it was definitely worth it. Such a special night. The Secret Garden even provides transport to and fro. How good is that?!","Restaurant that lives up to its name, a secret garden for dining in an idyllic setting in complete privacy.  Perfect service and dishes that will delight your taste buds, not to be missed on Lovina.  Reservation required as only 5 tables.  We strongly recommend"

The sauce of the Chicken Satay has too much sweet soy sauce instead of peanut sauce. The other food like Tempe, and The Grilled Chicken, they're OK. The place it's quite nice though, but the volume they set for the music is too loud. -Jun 2023","My sister and me love the sandwiches and the place

Everthing is nearly perfect

One thing is annoying:
All 2 minutes one loud beeb tone is super strange.

Everthing 5 stars
Just the beeb sound - 2 stars

I don't know why but turn it off! (:","Very¬≤ disappointed and so bad, not according to expectations, experience eat in buleleng so longest, where as there are not many people waiting, and employee not confirmation to me/ my wife for around estimation to we food order ready!!!
Not recomendation for me to eat in here...","I like the place for tasty and inexpensive food, kind service and for the really cool interior, full of light and modern with some balinese accents.","Cute, quaint and delicious üòã‚Ä¶and very cheap. Terima kasih Ally üëå"
