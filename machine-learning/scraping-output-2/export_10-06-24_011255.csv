Near arrival & near departure, perfect place for fast bite","Idk if the waitress is just busy or slacking, but there were no one in the cashier and when we called them, one of the waitress came to the cashier but then served another customer eventho we came first :(
We asked why she ignored us, she said ""we called you but you were busy talking, so i served another customer"". She didn't even say sorry.
We would've heard if she called us coz we were just 1m apart!

Therefore 3 stars, sorry..

The restaurant it self is cozy and clean tho.","The service is terrible! Waitresses ignore you (and they pretend they don't see you), when the food arrived they did not bring last dish, and when we almost finished food and asked where the last dish was, turned out they forgot about it!
Even then it took us 5 times asking different waitresses for our food until they brought it to us!
They were running around like headless chicken without any clue!
Their food is also not very tasty and completely different from their pictures.
As for drinks, the lemanade was too sweet and hot water too cold!
Terrible experience and place. Avoid at all costs!!!"

I still remember few months ago I take away from Pizza Hut Jakarta airport, they help me pack nicely and the staffs are very friendly introducing the menu for me. Without second thought I straight away go to Pizza Hut when I see it in the airport.
I was ordering my meal, two customers came over want to pay for the bill. While the staff is still half way taking my order, she just leave me hanging there and allowing the two customers to playing around fighting to pay for the bill without queueing. When I was in the line first and not to forget she is still serving me.
They took approximately 5mins for paying the 5.19M IDR bill, the guy want to pay cashes and his partner want to pay by card, after that incident I have to take away instead of dine in.
Fine. When my take away is finally ready. No bag was given. When I asked how am I supposed to carry the two take away containers and my luggage, the male staff that brought my food just say they sell a recycle bag. If you want to sell me bag, you should say early. But not until I realised it ! How do you expect your customer to hold it? Then what‚Äôs the point I take away?!!
But what I cannot tolerate the most is, who the hell let you soak my bread inside my mushrooms room soup? Did I give you the permission to force me to eat in this way?! It look super disgusting on how they serve their food to customer and I totally lost my appetite !!!
No next time !!!! Bad service ! Bad food serving !
No friendly for take away !","Ok.
Mushroom soup is very good. Meat lovers crispy bites is not that interesting. I would more recommend the soup. I advise to share the pizza üçï ! A bit expensive, maybe 200K+ for the large one.","We ordered cheese rolls, then what we got is cheese fries. We explained to waitress, as usually, they apologized with smile then  refused to change this disgusting fries to cheese rolls, but suggested us to order another cheese rolls.","Nice place , all halal food , free wifi .","Very tasty meals, recommended !"

The chairs have seen better days, but they're not bad. The food options are decent, but not for vegetarians. Many items are not labeled, so it's hard to tell what has meat in it and what doesn't.

The bar has many mocktail options, and I enjoyed the ginger one. The iced latte was also nice.

For those who can get in for ""free"" with their unlimited Priority Pass usage, this is a worthwhile place to visit. If I had to pay or use up one of a limited number of lounge visits, I wouldn't come here again; but since I don't have to pay, I'd gladly come back here (just not expecting to get much to eat). It's nothing remarkable, but in my opinion it wasn't nearly as bad as some of the other reviews make it out to be. But each person's experience is different.",It‚Äôs a spacious lounge with some food options. HOWEVER if you‚Äôre vegan then you‚Äôll have to stick to the fruits. It also looks like some of the food goes untouched for a while and doesn‚Äôt get switch out for fresh items.,"This review for the international side.
Rp600000($60) entrance fee . Most of the hot dishes were very dry , as well as the pastry‚Äôs. Wifi is nonexistent‚Ä¶250kb/s, cokes, tea and coffees were ok .

Definitely not worth the $60Aus .","Simple lounge for travellers to rest and refresh before their flights.

Warm environment, as it is an open-space within departure complex. Limited food choices.","So I think the reviews here are mixed with the Concordia Lounge at the Domestic terminal and the International terminal (somehow both are called Concordia Lounge). The international lounge is not on Google maps, so I guess many of us decided to leave it here. (I don‚Äôt know how to create a new place on Google maps apologies üò©)
My photos are from the international terminal, and like some of the reviews, I think its just average, barely making the passing mark. While the variety is quite typical when compared to other lounges, this place is small, crowded (only lounge in the international terminal it seems, as we walked around) and there are small fruit flies landing on the food cos there are no covers ü´£ I went for the main dishes as those had covers.

The attentive staff, especially Mr. Agus, made our time fly by. Highly recommend!","My short trip to Bali didn‚Äôt allow me to visit any coffee places so I was pleased to know Revolver is available at the airport. Menu and taste is the same as the other outlets. As for the interior, they are trying to still have the same vibe and decor, however the fact that 3 sides of the space is left open (no walls), it really does make the atmosphere a bit too noisy (but then again it is an airport so we cant expect much)","Went to eat here with a voucher because our flight was delayed. Put on a sign where they accepted latency vouchers. But when we wanted to pay they told us ""only specific vouchers"" so ours didn't apply.... Criminaly misleading","Great coffee, food and service. Nice open indoor area with lots of natural light during the day in comparison to the one at international terminal (also better food and service here) went here enough to have the staff knowing what I want, never a dull moment - sat here waiting for my flight at my corner while people watching rather than the airport lounge."

So, we went there for a few hours between domestic flights, and had a bad experience with the cashier.

We simply wanted to order some cakes and coffees, and the staff offered us some 'customization' without making it clear. For example, we ordered some coffee (I forgot which one) and the question was do you want full cream milk or almond milk? There were a few questions so we chose based on the options given. However, when the total bill was out, it was around 2.5x the original order. They never informed us about the additional cost of those choices.

Fortunately, they changed the order when we questioned them, although they gave indication that we were wasting their time (and you wasted ours).

Meh.","I‚Äôm a Starbucks fan, so I always visit any store whenever I can. The Starbucks in Bali airport was also an impressive store with some special drinks in the menu, and Balinese decor is really lovely. I enjoyed a cup of coffee and an almond croissant at Starbuck. The staff also introduced to me the Bali coffee and gave me a cup of Bali coffee to taste. I felt so relax and enjoyable when I took a break here after a long flight.","Starbucks is always a solid choice for any travelers who may be afraid of travel sickness.
I got the Asian Dolce Latte with oatmilk hot and it was hella good!
Plus it came with a personalized note!
Wooooo",Starbucks Bali Airport is wonderful. Salted Caramel is always the best. Efod floor manager is a star.,"This place is packed with people and it's not comfortable to sit here and enjoy the coffee. Price is more expensive than non-airport starbucks.

After an average meal at an alternative airport cafe last time I departed, I chose this place as it was packed and pumping last time (partly why I looked elsewhere before).
My ham and cheese croissant was pretty standard, well heated through, and the cheese nicely melted etc. The cappuccino was about average too - not the worst I‚Äôve had in Bali.
Service is quick and friendly. The place is clean, with plenty of seating, including some booths which have international double jack points for recharging your devices, which is a pretty thoughtful idea.
Prices are about what you‚Äôd expect from an airport cafe Rp115k (AUD$10.80), incl GST/service.","Been here twice now. Coffee was ok, mocha was a tad too sweet and the food was good too. Staff are friendly, they are quick to attend to your needs. And they allow you to choose to pay with your currency or rupiah on the card which is great.","Their cappuccino is a delight. Spent the remaining time of my stay in Bali here, at the airport. The pricing is decent knowing that their location is in the airport. I love your fries!","Definitely the right choice for us. Nothing to complain about. The staff is nice, the service fast. The cappuccino was good. We had a tomato-cheese toasty, which was fresh and tasty. Prices ok for airport. And there is salt and pepper on the table, much appreciated!","Definitely love the place with yellow tone.
Looks so bright, cheerful, and can boost my mood when I visit this place.
It is located at gate 1 in domestic terminal. This may be your alternative if you are hungry but can‚Äôt enter the lounge.
Foods taste similar like others, overpriced because its airport taxes.
Overall it is good.
This time I order mango freezy (mango juice + ice cream + coconut + nata de coco).

The food is atrociously awful. See the pic I took, that‚Äôs their ‚Äòmushroom quiche‚Äô which is basically a dump of broken up crushed quiche in a serving bowl.

Only beer and wine, no spirits, fridges are broken down so nothing is cold. Thankfully we ate before we arrived at the airport.","As a guest who brings a toddler, i would say this lounge is pretty good. They have a clean nursery room. The staff are all very friendly. Im not sure why the other reviews stated otherwise. However, i agree on the food selection , it could have more options and not too much cold dishes.

Sipri , who greets us at the front reception has given an excellent service. He has given more than what usual staff would do. Well done!","This is probably the worst Garuda Business Class Lounge i've been into. I'm sorry but Concordia Lounge has a better lounge.
The toilet is smelly and not regularly cleaned. So sad that this happend in Bali Airport where it should've been the best place to finally relax before departure. Is it because Garuda only focuses on International Lounge ? I dont know. But this should be addressed.
