Immediately. Breakfast was worthy.","I stayed in studio room for 2 nights. The room was good enough to sleep and head out for activity in sanur or tour in bali. The staff was ok.

There also a free shuttle to beach and shopping area in sanur.","We booked the studio, the staff is really nice they answer us really quick and help us whenever we asked for anything. It's just that the studio is not nice . The room looks renovated but I guess it's not getting cleaned well and not taken care of ever since it was renovated. The bathroom shower handle needs decalcifying, the water pressure is changing all the time from good to almost no pressure at all, also the bathroom mirror looks like it's 200 years old with stain and stuff on it. The pool is dirty (green color) it's basically useless. And lastly the door to the pool is half glass half wood and in the morning the light is so bright we woke up at 6h30 everyday also because we could hear everything happening outside. It's a shame you're not taking care of the rooms, the place is really nice."

Nasi campur: grilled chicken, including a satay stick, and rice with green bean, cassava leaves, boiled egg and bean sprouts coconut dish. Chilli sambal on the side if you like it a little spicy.
There are a few ways they do the rice, e.g. steamed normally or steamed in triangle shapes (compressed triangles of steamed rice). This way they give a bit more curry sauce in a bowl which looks a bit like soup and the triangle rice sits in the soup.
Very tasty and will definitely be back."

My wife ordered a Japanese salad with chicken and it was no Japanese salad. Mainly garden salad with too much salt. We didn‚Äôt eat them and raised concerns with staff. Not sure what happened to this venue but it‚Äôs a total 180degree change from how good the food was last year. And we ate here over a dozen times last year for lunch, just about every day. The watermelon juice was fine though. The wait staff removed the food from the bill, as they should, but we won‚Äôt be back. Disappointing.","I absolutely love this place! The food is top-notch!!

This small warung has been our go-to spot for about five years now, and it never disappoints. The recent renovations have really elevated the whole experience ‚Äì walking in feels fresh, and the staff are always so welcoming.

Now, let's talk about the food. The menu is packed with dishes made from locally sourced, organic ingredients, and you can taste the difference. Today, I went for the Falafel wrap and a fresh Coconut, and it was fantastic!. But honestly, you can't go wrong with anything here. The toasted ciabatta's are a personal favorite, and don't even get me started on the chicken & shiitake mushrooms salad ‚Äì it's next level.

Plus, they've got great options for the kiddos too, which is a huge win for us since our son is gluten-free.
The coffee it‚Äôs also great & you can enjoy a couple of hours working remotely from there to break the daily routine :)

Whether you're all about that healthy lifestyle or you just love good food, this place is a winner. Seriously, do yourself a favor and check it out for a tasty lunch or dinner.

Located across from the gym that we go to, we were intrigued as we hadn‚Äôt eaten Lebanesian food in a long time an the menu looked super legit!

We stopped by in early afternoon and was excited to see they have the Mezze plates so we ordered 3 of them as each would cost 35k, but if you order 3, it‚Äôs only 85k which means you are saving 20k. Plus it‚Äôs great to share these plates! We also ordered a side Arabic bread for 15k which was super tasty, though I would have loved to see the bread built into the platters especially the hummus because you can‚Äôt have hummus without pita! :)

We ordered hummus, fattoush and the falafel, all three of which were tasty. Falafel was a nice size but I would have loved a crispier outside. The hummus could be a little creamier as it was on the watery side and then fattoush was super fresh!

As for mains, this is what we really came for as the chicken skewers were fantastic with the garlic sauce! Chicken was cooked to perfection and fell off the skewer and was super tender. The lamb steak we ordered was also really nice! Juicy and cooked nicely though I personally would have like my fat to be rendered more.

Overall for the two of us we spent 205k for a nice lunch which I think was a pretty fair price. The only suggestion I would make is to maybe come up with a lunch special platter that people can enjoy for lunch with some rice or salad or falafel. That has always worked well for people on the go.

Yummy food in a cute location! Can‚Äôt wait to bring more friends here!","Loved everything about this warung. The food is incredible and the owner and staff are so friendly. We had hummus, falafel, cheese stick, halloumi cheese, bread and lamb steak and everything was perfect. Don‚Äôt forget the coffee üòçüòç thank you so much for an amazing experience. Highly recommend sitting upstairs and chilling there.",Complete misrepresentation And disappointment. The food was not good. The Falafel were miniature size as well as the Kibbeh ( much smaller than my thumb). So so small - The salad was a joke in portion- maybe max 2 spoons of tabbouleh (brown color too). They only had appetizers and nothing was available from the grill - no shawarma nor anything of chicken or meats.  You can barely call it a restaurant. The lady was very kind and attentive and simply served what was available . Pricey for the tiny portions.,"Nice food from a small restaurant great place for a small group, narrow staircase to the top area.."

Room is well furnished including main bedroom little kitchen and bathroom. Very good communication with landlord who's such a nice and helpful man. If you're planning or gonna plan your trip to bali and want a cheap and nice accommodation- the place is just for you. Highly recommended.,"Totally worth the price. All the basic amenities available. The building is also in good condition, being more recently constructed. The host is the most sweetest guy, available at any given time and ready to help with anything. The house keeping was also prompt and reliable. Stayed here for 4 months since Jan. Very close to the highway as well. Easy to find on maps. I would most definitely recommend this stay for anyone planning to visit Bali for a long period. Safe for single girls to stay there as well.","owner was always friendly, kind and ready to help us with everything. He usually responds to our questions through WhatsApp in like 5 minsüòÄ We enjoyed the stay here. Place was clean!","We could not be more happy and grateful to have Kubu Lestari as our first stop here in Bali. We stayed here for a month. The place is very simple yet has everything one might need. Cleaning once a week and being close to laundry service and local shops, great warungs nearby makes it very well located. A bit away from the beach for walking, but if you ride a moto or order a gojeck is not a big deal. But mainly we loved our stay there because of Wayan, who is simply very kind, helpful and friendly person! From start to finish he was always there if we needed help, would give good piece of advice or explain some cultural points. Also simply a honest and nice person to have a conversation))) He also kindly provides gas and water refill only for 20k, which is extremely handy, as you don't want to carry it yourself. We spent a lovely month here and would be happy to come back again. Terima kasih"

Clean and good size pool, quiet location i could actually sleep away from noisy streets.

Laundry not far down the road a few minutes if that.

Would definitely recommend. It was in the more quiet area of sanur but only a few minutes drive to restaurants ect, we walked most times so not to far :)","We stayed here for 1 month and we LOVED it.
June - July 2019.
The room and the place were clean, Erwin (the staff) took good care of the place really well. He really makes sure that we are comfortable on our stay.
AC, shower / bathtub, TV, wardrobes, pantry with stove and pots and pans and cutleries are available for use to use.
As for the location, this is across the street from the main street of Sanur. A few minutes walk but very quiet and very safe.

I don‚Äôt understand where these people‚Äôs reviews come from!  reviews bought and paid, I recommend you do not even read.

we were going to stay there for a month, but left on the first day!  starting from how we were met!  we arrived with a small child, agreed in advance with the owner that we would arrive at 11 in the morning.  arrived, the doors were locked.  nobody was waiting for us!  we stood under the sun for 20 minutes with a child in our arms and knocked on the door so that someone would open for us.  after 20 minutes, the helper of the hosts came out and let us in.  immediately the owner came and asked for the rest of the co-payment for housing and immediately issued a HUGE list of rules (which they themselves do not observe)!  the owner spoke out: you live with us, so you live according to our rules.  you do not have the right to vote.

very noisy, this is not a vacation but hell!  the owner promised to install a stove, and instead brought a stove with which they go camping.

and finally at 10 pm they continued to make a lot of noise, and reacted aggressively to comments.  we left that night.  and that was the surest decision!"
