It‚Äôs completely free to enter
The only minus thing is that you cannot take a photo inside the museum","Very good experiences. You can see various stones, the story of the volcano eruption, woods and animal(mummified), that was live in Batur forest. Must visit place if you like history and geography",Very good museum and well worth a visit for information about the history of Batur and other geoparks. Not all signs are in English though. Free entry !!,"Interesting place to learn about Mount Batur, a member of Indonesia's ring of fire. Mount Batur is an active volcano which also hosts numerous kinds of animals and vegetation, as well as various Balinese traditional communities. The museum displays scenes and samples of rocks, plants, taxidermy, statues and fossils in its two-stories building. A mini theater is also available for visitors to watch a short documentary movie about the volcano and the communities around it.

A scenic restaurant is also available nearby (less than 5-minutes walk) where you can enjoy the beautiful view of Mount Batur and its vast Batur Lake, an active caldera of the volcano.","Entrance is free, which was a nice surprise. Also no donation, you just need to register as a visitor. The main exhibition is about volcanoes, and more specifically about the volcanic activity of mount Batur of course. After that, there are two smaller exhibitions, one about biodiversity and one about cultural diversity.

Unfortunately, about half of the descriptions in the museum are missing English translation, which is a bit confusing. Also throughout the museum there are QR-codes, which I assume should provide additional information, but they don‚Äôt seem to be working.

For a free museum, I think it‚Äôs worth taking a look inside if you‚Äôre already in the area."

The only weakness is the outdoor are smoking area, so it is not so comfortable for the people who is not smoking.","My friend and I came here as a part of our tour itinerary. This area should be a part of the Kintamani village. We stopped by this place for lunch, which has the view of the beautiful Mount Batur and the lake. The area is high hence it is very cooling here. I think the view is beautiful. It's very nice to sit and chill and look at the nice view at the same time!

Food (buffet style) however was so-so, nothing too special. I think you can get better Indonesian food from the warungs. But the staffs are really nice. Kudos to them.","everything is good in this place, BUT IF ITS PRICE WAS 400 thousand
everything else is just a view and EVERYTHING. It was impossible to sleep because it was very stuffy, a beautiful bath from TIK-TOK did not fill up even in two hours. but when I paid and they couldn‚Äôt even make me just a REGULAR OMELET, I was in a hurry to write a review.

They serve coffee, breakfast, lunch, brunch, maybe dinner.

Best experience maybe in the morning.","After seeing sunrise and having breakfast in Kintamani area, this place is the way to go to continue with brunch or lunch. The view of Lake Batur is one of the selling points.

Another selling points, of course the taste of their foods. I ordered squid ink fried rice and it was so tasty. Unfortunately, when I was there the coffee machine was under maintenance, so couldn‚Äôt give any input for the coffee. (That‚Äôs why I put the food and service only four stars)

Since we were too early and it was totally understandable that something was little bit below our expectations. For the price is little bit in pricey side but expected. In overall, this place is one of the alternative restaurant with good viewing points to Lake Batur."

Would love it to go up here again.","My friends and myself did this hike/walk with the tour and enjoyed every moment. The tour guides stop frequently with the groups to make sure everyone is okay, once at the top, they serve a breakfast of boiled eggs, banana bread (banana sandwich really), fruit and a chocolate bar while you take in the view! I recommend wearing joggers that you don‚Äôt mind getting dirty and have some grip as you will need this for the walk back down.","Mount Batur offers a breathtaking view that's truly awe-inspiring. As you ascend this active volcano in Bali, Indonesia, you're greeted with panoramic vistas that encompass serene landscapes, lush greenery, and the stunning beauty of Lake Batur. The sunrise hike, in particular, unveils an ethereal experience as the first light of day breaks over the horizon, casting hues of orange and pink across the sky. The sight from the summit of Mount Batur rewards hikers with an unforgettable view that makes the trek and effort entirely worthwhile.","I went on a guided mount Batur sunrise hike. Totally worth it! To see the sunrise, you will start the hike at 2 or 3 AM. The hike itself will be around 2 hours long. It is not easy, but also not hard. I would say - moderate level. There are many locals with the bikes offering transfer to the top or down the mountain throughout all the route, so if you feel tired and have cash (approximately 350k IDR) you can decide to use this option at any moment. The way down is more challenging as the route is very rocky and slippery. Make sure you bring cash with you, as there are some local sellers and a cafe at the top of the mountain.","Good place to view the lake and the mountain. Because this on kintamani, of course the air is cold.
No need to pay anything for enter this place, but I don‚Äôt like the local seller who insist selling their stuff, event we already reject them, so weird."

This was experienced whilst enjoying the most magical views.

I definitely rate this 5/5 and would love to go back.","I don‚Äôt know about the hotel, we only had food in the restaurant. The staff wasn‚Äôt too attentive, they were rather careless. The food was just ok, but quite overpriced. They don‚Äôt have enough local dishes and I couldn‚Äôt care less for burgers. Both my glass and plate had a chip on it.

The location is beautiful but food and staff are bad.
The staff were not  attentive, they were rather careless. They took an hour to get us fries, pizza and omelet , that to served cold,  a cut fruit plate never arrived, when asked for it they got 4 melon and papaya pieces and charged us high. Coffee was served before the lunch and that again cold, even after specifically asking for hot coffee.
Basic margarita pizza was bad that we could not eat.
When asked if they can hurry up their service ,‚Äù if it‚Äôs Alcarte you just need to wait was their response‚Äù.
Lots of flies in here.
It‚Äôs a waste of time to dine here.",We had our lunch buffet at the restaurant. Lunch with a beautiful view of the Lake Batur & Mount Batur.,"Booked this through online booking, but the room is pretty different from the picture, maybe if you like vintage hotel you might enjoy it.

The room itself is basic, but fair in rrlation to the room rate. The bathroom was kinda smelky though, maybe also caused by the mothballs. Keeping the bathroom door closed and having the fan in the bath room on at intervals kept the unpleasant smell out of the room.
Wifi was not very stable, being regularly forced to sign in again.
The staff was friendly and properly cleaned the room daily.","This stay boasts a unique cave concept, eliminating the need for AC thanks to the naturally chilly temperature. The room and bathroom are clean, offering a superb view from the balcony, especially during sunrise. The bathtub, though spacious, might be too big for comfort, and a bit of patience is needed for the hot water to flow.

Lake and other attractions very accessible by car or motorbike.,"I stayed here recently with my partner, we arrived around 8:00 pm, and couldn't find the hotel at first, it is a little bit hidden.
Luckily the staff responded quick to our message and helped us to check in.
The room was okay, it was clean, the blanket was thin, I had to ask for a spare blanket which the staff gave to us even though it was already at 10:00 pm.
We could see mold on the wall next to the bed, and some stains on the wall near the roof. The roof must be leaking when it's raining heavily.
You can see the lake and mountains from the bedroom / living room as well as from the bathroom. The view is awesome!
The room was quiet at night time but we could smell the incense that was burned in front of our room at night.
Our bike did not start on the next day but the staff offered a help and brought our bike to the bike service. Again super service from the staff. They are very friendly, so helpful and saved our trip.","The view from our this hotel balcony is outstanding (10/10)! We can see clearly Lake Batur, Mount Batur, and Mount Abang from our room. But honestly, that the only main positive thing about this hotel.
Staffs are friendly but the facilities about this hotel needs to be improved. The bathtub doesn‚Äôt work in our room and they don‚Äôt have hairdryer. Breakfast is also average (5/10). Very unfortunate if they improve the facilities it will be a very good hotel and i will definitely come back üôÇ"

I definitely recommend this restaurant if you wish to enjoy a nice lunch with great view on Mount Batur!",No water and no way to change the room. They didn't even bring some bottles or a bucket of water so no way to use the bathroom. We just paid for a bed in a dirty room.

For a restaurant you probably cannot get better view than this. The view alone is 5 stars.

The food was good, it was on the pricey side for what they offered but I am sure they are paying a lot for their plot of land with a view. We had fish and chicken. They also had very cold beer - which is always a plus. We added pictures of the menu to our review.

The staff were very attentive and polite.

They have a cute little area where you can take really good pictures with the view.

All in all we had a good experience.

@eyecool = follow brown bacon","""Sari Hill Bali disappoints on multiple fronts. While the only redeeming quality is the view of Mount Batur, everything else falls short. The service is abysmal, lacking any semblance of friendliness. The food fails to meet expectations, with bland flavors and lackluster presentation that simply doesn't justify the exorbitant prices. Not only that, but the wait for food is excruciatingly long, further dampening the overall experience. It's truly regrettable that such a beautiful setting overlooking Mount Batur is marred by subpar food and service.""","Food is very good we came here by 9.15 most of the restaurants are closed. Very fortunately this people opened the restaurant. We took Veg Burger, Sandwiches, Cappuccino coffee, Pappaya juice all very tasty.",This is probably one of my most memorable experiences in Bali. The place is quiet and very unassuming. They had a decent list of local food which is exactly what we were looking for. I had the ikan bakar panggang and it was soooo awesome. It came with a sambal sauce that looked home made and just had the right salty spicy mix. Will definitely recommend going there for dinner (between 5-6pm) because you get to see a nice view of the volcano and witness sundown.,"We came here to have coffee so can't say about their food. Nice seating area offering the whole view of mt Batur and the lake.
There is another free platform for viewing close by if you don't want to pay but we desperately need coffee. Cappucino was nice for this type of weather. We were there at 11am and we were the only ones."
