From the second we arrived we knew we‘ve come to a special place. The staff was extremely attentive (especially Reni) and made us feel at home.
We borrowed a scooter for a day to explore the surroundings and took part in some of the activities offered at the resort.
The massage was outstanding, one of the best we had in Bali!
We also enjoyed the cooking class (you can choose the dishes you want to prepare from the menu) and the offerings making session. It was a great way to learn more about Bali culture!
Two nights were clearly not enough, so we cannot wait to come back!
Until next time!

P.S.: We took a grab from canggu to get there, but the suggested route on Maps turned out not to be primarily made for cars. Maybe check with the resort first to get advice on which route to take!","10
“If you want a stunning view from your room and pool book here”
The hotel is on the top of the hill with a great view. At the pool you can relax with this unique view. It’s very calm area with friendly local people. The stuff of the hotel is extremely kind and helpful. If you have any food intolerance or allergies they are open to preparer a special food for you. We really appreciate it. In person the accommodation looks better than on the pictures. Thank you for everything, we highly recommend this hotel.",We booked this hotel as we where on our way to wear Bali. We should of stay there. The hotel is very good and the staff is so friendly and nice! The view from the pool and the roof terrace is stunning! We had dinner and breakfast which was also very good! Good place to come back to.,"This place would win you over with its serene vibe and location!
It’s not easy to get to but it’s worth coming if you need to reset and recharge your batteries. Munduk village is 16 km from here so you’ll need a driver or bike to go around. There are lots of natural spots around for which you’ll need a guide. Staff are so friendly and attentive as well.
This is by no means luxury villa but it’s got swimming pool and stunning rooftop terrace to watch sunset or stars. Bring some warm clothes. I’m gonna miss this place❤️","I have been here to this hotel take our client ,
Hotel was nice and clean , swimming pool are good and view was amazing and absolutely breathtaking
Mountains and greenery are absolutely gorgeous
The road to get this place are nice but so small and  narrow ! Be carefully when you are not really professional driving in the mountains"
