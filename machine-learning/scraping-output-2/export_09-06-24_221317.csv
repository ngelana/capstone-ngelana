From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by welcoming, kind, and friendly staff who made our stay truly memorable. A special shout out to Ketut, Putu and the hotel manager who went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful experience.

During our stay, my partner had a few bumps, possibly from a bug. Putu was quick to assist, providing a healing oil that helped clear it up within the day. His attentiveness and care were truly appreciated.

The highlight of the resort is undoubtedly the stunning pool overlooking the ocean. We also loved the design of the rooms, which featured traditional Balinese touches. The outdoor shower was a fantastic touch, adding to the overall tranquillity of the resort.

For those looking to explore the North area of Bali, I highly recommend staying at Puri Bagus. It offers a lovely oasis away from the hustle and bustle of other tourist spots in Bali. Additionally, there are many surrounding businesses that offer a free shuttle service, making it easy to get out and about.

Thank you, Puri Bagus, for a wonderful stay. We hope to visit again soon!","The room is good with stunning beach views, breakfast is also excelent We can also rent a boat to see the dolphins.","This resort is beautiful! It‚Äôs peaceful, relaxing and the staff are amazing. They went above and beyond when my husband and I were sick. The hotel manager Ketut got us Panadol and made sure we were okay. Although we were disappointed to be sick , we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more beautiful place to recover in. Special mention to Putu! He remembered our names (which was so sweet) and was always so friendly. All of the staff here are wonderful, I wish I remembered everyone‚Äôs names. But thank you to you all.
The restaurant does a really good mix of western and Indonesian food, so we never got bored eating almost every meal here. The drinks menu has heaps of variety too! Their juices and healing style ginger drinks saved me from feeling a lot worse.
Like everywhere you do have local vendors on the beach with pearls and materials to sell, they will raise them up to show you their products, but they won‚Äôt shout at you or go into the resort area. They seem respectful enough to not bother you, but just enough to say ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm here if you‚Äôre interested‚Äù.
The pool at the resort over looks the ocean, and it‚Äôs only a stones throw away from the beach. The pool is clean and big. It is deeper than most resort pools though, didn‚Äôt bother us Aussie‚Äôs, but sick the she shallow if you can‚Äôt swim.
Terima kasih Puri Bagus Lovina!","If you're looking for a beautiful and peaceful getaway in Bali, Puri Bagus Lovina is the perfect place to stay. The resort is situated right on the beach and offers breathtaking views of the ocean and surrounding landscape.

One of the standout features of Puri Bagus Lovina is the exceptional level of service provided by the staff. From the moment you arrive, you're made to feel welcome and taken care of. The staff is incredibly attentive, friendly, and always willing to go above and beyond to ensure that your stay is as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.

The rooms at Puri Bagus Lovina are spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated in a traditional Balinese style. They're also equipped with all of the amenities you need to feel right at home, including air conditioning, a minibar, and a private balcony or terrace with stunning views.

The resort also has a range of excellent facilities, including a beautiful infinity pool overlooking the ocean, a spa offering a range of relaxing treatments, and a restaurant serving delicious Indonesian and international cuisine.

Overall, I would highly recommend Puri Bagus Lovina to anyone looking for a luxurious and peaceful escape in Bali. The beautiful location, exceptional service, and excellent facilities make it the perfect place to relax, unwind, and soak up the beauty of this incredible island.","After staying 2 nights and have eaten at the place I can say the staff is super friendly and the food is good. The place itself needs a good renovation, the place breaths a 70‚Äôs style and thus feels a bit old fashioned. Huge cracks in the pavement around the swimming pool, ants on the seats, pool bar not operational anymore, many lights and sockets not functioning anymore. Since the beach is freely accessible in front of the hotel, guests are harassed for dolphin tours, snorkeling and other tours (which could be expected where tourism is the holy grail). More efficient staffing could improve the holiday feeling guests look for. 4 staff at the bar that only move when you order a drink, can or should see other work. With some investments I am sure they can restore this resort in its original beauty."

Singer and band were talented and played some nice classics and modern covers. Guests come to stage to sing also which is fun and entertaining. Outside area is also nice and street noise is almost not audible. Service / waitresses were very nice as well. We recommend to spend at least one evening here if you are here for holidays. Even many locals come here.,"Environment and Music excellent!
Food is not good at all!

It is very nice place with live music and very good design!
We enjoyed a music a lot, it was Indonesian women singing very beautiful and stylish!)

Personal is very pleasant and fast, there is even a device on your table with buttons to call or ask a bill, which was helping a lot!)

But food is terrible, we ordered a few things to check and enjoyed nothing:
- Chicken on sticks was very tough and dry.
- Beef stale was probably from supermarket which inside was all from fat and was not possible to eat, even with some strange sausage different from what they have in a menu.
- Gado-gado salad was with not testy vegetables
- Chicken burger was burnt and with strange chicken inside, like from frozen ready-to-cook food without neutral taste.

They try to do cheaper, but this resulted in quality a lot.

I would really recommend it was entertainment, but not for eating!","Wonderful place, really nice friendly staff! üòç

We came at a quiet time for early dinner. Live music was played inside which was a little too loud to be able to have a conversation so we decided to get a table outside.

The drinks were really good, although the strawberry milkshake was a little too sweet perhaps. The Stroganoff Chicken didn't really have a Stroganoff taste to me but was totally okay with a creamy sauce. It was served with a pretty good mashed potato which I liked. The Italian chicken steak with fries was just okay I think, not that special.

We asked for an appetizer salad served together with the main dish and this salad was really good. It had some parmesan cheese and spices, proper amount of dressing sauce and definitely not boring. I would just suggest to reduce the size of the giant croutons though, that was a little too much.

We gave a tip for the good service here. This was very good value for money. üëç","ITS A BIG NO!!!!

If you are a local and considered only consumed 1 portion of food & beverage to chill, just think twice to go to this place.

I went there with friend for dinner on Saturday Night.

We went upstairs and chosen our table.
Until one of their waitresses came and didn‚Äôt allowed us to sit.. as upstairs space was only for minimum 4 people. Its funny, because no one of them was informed us about it earlier. Meanwhile there were 2 waitresses were stood there when we came in. So we got asked to move to other table.

Each of us ordered 1 portion of food & 1 portion of drink. When we finished our dinner, suddenly one of their waitresses came to give us a bill for payment without any command.
We then asked him ‚Äúif this place is about to close or is it already last order?‚Äù. Because it was 10.00 pm, meanwhile their closing time is 12.00 am.
He answered ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù thats all, without any apparent reason.

Its ridiculous, and quite insulting.

Just because of they want to accommodate more people who will consume lots of alcohol (in order to boost up their revenue), they kicked out their other guests who are not willing to do so.

I saw some other local guests were also to be treated the same. And left the restaurant with disappointment.

Except, one table across to us that occupied by a bunch of foreigners who kept ordering liquors.

They should have been respectful to their customer, by to treat everyone there as the same.

Keep in mind, Good customer service always helps retain your customers. It is what keeps your customers coming back for more purchases. Retaining customers increases your revenue and it's also much cheaper to keep a customer than to try to gain a new one."

Located in the middle of a residential area, about 900 meters from Penimbangan beach, the exterior looks like a boarding house, but the room is quite spacious, clean, and comfortable, with the typical friendliness of Balinese staff. For breakfast, the guest house doesn't cook in their own kitchen but buys packed rice from outside. During peak season stays, some guests bring children, making the atmosphere quite noisy, especially when kids swim in the small pool on the first floor. As a suggestion, choose a room on the second floor for a relatively quieter experience. Also, please be cautious with the tap water in the sink and shower as it can be quite hot.",I never write a bad review but this place was not good. The room was old and not well maintained. The paint was falling of the all and the AC barley worked. The breakfast I ordered came in a paper bag 10 seconds after I ordered it. It was clearly made day(s) ago and not even heated up. The rice was really dry and I did not eat more then 2 bites‚Ä¶,"Great guesthouse! Unfortunately we only stayed for one night, but spent a lot of time in the room. It was very clean, comfortable and quiet. It‚Äôs a good choice if you‚Äôre considering this place:)","Checked in at around 8 PM and assisted by a security guy. The first room the guy gave us has a strong smells of cigarettes and we also found some cigarette's butts in the shower room. But since the property was not running full-house, so they just move us to another room, which is better. So, problem's solved.

Room is quite spacious and comfortable. It is also well-maintained and clean, maybe because it is a new opening property. Hope they can maintain the cleanliness. üòâ

A smart digital TV is installed in the room. If you have Netflix account, you can just simply login there and watch your favorit movie on the TV screen.

I think this accommodation has some of the best maintenance and upkeep I‚Äôve seen throughout my stays in Bali. The garden is absolutely beautiful. And although the rooms feel a bit dated, they are very well maintained and I have no complaints. I have to say that after entering my room I had doubts about the bathroom, as the shower resembled a giant bird‚Ä¶ But it turned out to be one of the best showers I‚Äôve had in a long time!

The food was gorgeous we had ribs, chicken sauce padang and spicy spaghetti but the portions are TINY (no pizza still). This is a very poorly managed restaurant and the service appalling (we arrived at 19:00) and now 20:00 and still no pizza!","Had some lunch here with my friends, i ordered ayam lada hitam and the taste was so good, i got so juicy chicken leg. But better if they make it spicier. Overall i recommended this place","The place quiet comfort.
The food?
Love the snack platter. The beef steak is a bit small.

Menu isn't complete. Several item was out when I am order."

If they were on Grab I would have made many more orders - especially since there isn't anything on Grab for vegans around Lovina.",I was very happy about the food and service until they asked me to pay an extra 15k per food for the package to take away. So it's good if you want to eat inside but there is no door and it's very noisy outside.,"Delicious food, a lot of choices and different flavors, super nice owners. They gave me a free kambucha welcome shot. The portions are a bit small, but I think it would be nice if you come with two and order 3dishes and taste the different recipes. I had the steak and the bebek pedes manis, which had a delicious chili lemon sauce.","In my personal  Michelin rating this place would have 2 stars. Its worth visiting singharaja just to eat all this amazing veggie duck, chicken and so on...

I found three places with all this seitan delicacies in singharaja and just one in kuta.

Alay is the best of them.",Nice clean resto but a bit noisy from the traffic. I usually get take away. The portions are good and the veggies are fresh.
