I told it to the woman in the reception and she just told them to shut the music down, which they did for a while until they put it back. When I asked her to change my room she laughed.
After that she started speaking by phone very loud next to our room at 1 am so I don't think she cares if we can rest or not.

Would recommend steering clear of this restaurant. Food is quite tasty but plastic keeps showing up in food.

If this was a restaurant in Australia, it would be shut down. Finding plastic pieces in food is completely unacceptable. And after reading the reviews on here, I see that it's a regular occurrence. Which would suggest that there is a lack of caring when preparing the food. If it was only one time and they learnt from it, everyone makes mistakes. But the fact that it's happened over and over again. It's just not worth the risk to eat there. The food could be the best tasting food in the world, but if there's a risk it will shorten your life?
