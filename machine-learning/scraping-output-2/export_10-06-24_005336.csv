It‚Äôs not a bad experience and the sampling set is actually great.

The pricing on those coffee beans are definitely not that pleasant.","Cute and quaint little coffee plantation with a local guide for FREE. An assortment of samples of teas and coffee are given out at no cost. The tour guide will show you how luwat coffee is made from start to finish and you can actively see how they roast their beans. There is also a shop where there is no pressure to buy goods, but they are readily available. If you want to try their luxury civet coffee, it is sold at a reasonable price of around $4usd. Had a wonderful time here being educated on how they refine their coffee and tea.","Visited this Coffee estate as part of our trip. Thrilled to try their tea and coffee sampler set of 15 varieties with banana chips. Later tasted their special Luwak Coffee, it was strong and got a different flavor compared with regular coffees. Staff was well trained, shown us the entire process of how seeds will be and baking them, pounding and packing. Good experience, do visit !!","We stopped here on a tour as a suggestion from our driver. My partner and I were given a guided tour of the coffee plantation and a thorough explanation of how luwak coffee is grown, processed, collected, roasted and ground. Then we were offered a tasting sample of 15 coffees, teas and hot chocolates. This is offered for free but we wanted to support this business and try their full-sized luwak coffee (for roughly $5.50 AUD). We later purchased packets of speciality flavoured coffee and tea for $18 AUD each.

I enjoyed most of the coffees and liked trying all of them. My partner (neither a tea nor coffee drinker) really enjoyed the sampling board and the whole experience.

Our host (whose name I can't remember at the time of posting this review) was super knowledgable, and one of the friendliest people we met on our trip.

We couldn't believe the value and experience offered for free/ low cost. This was by far our favourite attraction to do while in Bali!","I stopped by here to enjoy their selection of coffee and tea, it was a delightful experience with detailed explanations from the guide. You must try the mangosteen tea and Kopi Luwak here with a padi field view."

Good service, good value. Food was amazing, they transform unusual ingredients into creative dishes and presents them with impeccable style. All the components match perfectly on a plate.
What an amazing experience!!","The only fine dining experience you would like to have in Bali: beautiful, authentic, activating all your senses. Stunning combination of theater, music, lights and exquisite dishes. Really unforgettable, incomparable, one of a kind! Bravo to the owners, chef and the whole team of Gajah Putih!","I recently dined at Gajah Putih Restaurant in Ubud and was thoroughly impressed with my experience. The serene ambiance combined with impeccable service made for a delightful evening. The menu offered a diverse selection of dishes, each expertly prepared and bursting with flavor with lots of surprises! I particularly enjoyed the traditional Balinese specialties, which gave me a true taste of the local cuisine (I couldn‚Äôt spill too much but it‚Äôs really good value for the money for 11 courses and surprises + deliver in magical theatrical way!).
The staff were attentive and knowledgeable, enhancing the overall dining experience, especially the server Yanti and the General Manager Giovanni. I highly recommend Gajah Putih Restaurant to anyone looking for an unforgettable meal in Ubud.","Gajah Putih promises a captivating journey through Balinese culture, but the execution falls short. While the presentation and theatrical elements are impressive, the cultural touch felt superficial.

The biggest disappointment was the food itself. The portions were minuscule, leaving even the ""11-course"" meal feeling incomplete. The two meat dishes were particularly underwhelming in size. This, coupled with a lack of detailed knowledge from the staff about the wine pairings, detracted from the fine-dining experience.

For seasoned fine-diners, Gajah Putih might not meet expectations. The focus on theatrics overshadows the depth of flavor and the overall value. However, for first-time diners or those unfamiliar with fine dining experiences, the visual spectacle might be a delightful introduction.

Ubud's fine-dining scene has potential, but Gajah Putih needs refinement, particularly in portion size, dishes and wine pairing suggestions, and staff training, to make the experience worthwhile.","We had an amazing evening here. All the dishes were great, so interesting and delicious. The performance is impressive. Massive thanks to Rati and the rest of the team for the amazing service and making this dinner unforgettable. I had so much joy that I even had tears several times throughout the evening cause of emotions. You guys are awesome ü§çü§çü§ç"

The staff are all delightful and very helpful, the food at the restaurant is delicious and well priced. Our villa was so charming and made us feel so relaxed, the location is a little bit out of Ubud which makes it feel even more like a haven of tranquility.","This is beautiful. I can see some people complain about the chirping of birds, rustling leaves, the flowing water, etc but this is all nature and I can sleep soundly with it. The staff are highly trained and so helpful. Smiling at all times. Eka from the reception is helpful and Ayu from the restaurant is really nice and cheerful. I will definitely come back with my family.",The villa is very nice and comfortable. The quiet atmosphere is good for healing. Employees are very friendly and helpful. Recommend.,"Such a lovely place to stay near Ubud....so serene and peaceful. It's right next to a rice fields... the villas are well maintained, clean with facilities and service that you'd get in a 4/5 star hotel.
There is air conditioning..the beds are comfortable...very clean surroundings.

The breakfast is pretty nice...and the restaurant on the accommodation site has some pretty good meals too. They also have massage and spa services as well as laundry service at extra cost. Breakfast was included in our price booking...that was good.

The only thing to note is that you will need a driver or your own rental vehicle to get to Ubud city centre. Getting a private driver is the way to go...but some may choose to get a scooter to go around. However note that it's best to organise airport transfers yourself ahead of time...its not that difficult and can be difficult be online.

The staff are friendly and do their best to ensure my wife and had a great stay. And we loved our stay here.","Lovely place with very friendly staff, nice breakfast. Very scenic, and excellent villas/suite. It requires driving to leave the site, and the traffic into Ubud is insane.

For some this is a 5 star experience. However, the bathroom in the villa is open air, which means we had a lot of visits from insects and animals, some of which ended up in the room. The staff were very helpful with removing these, and it comes with the location. For us, it was bit too frequent for us to be completely comfortable with using the bathroom or the private outdoor area. I would advise anyone staying in this area to be aware of the above."

They also blast your rooms with air conditioner before you get there so it‚Äôs super nice once you get inside üòÇ.
I will yell recommendations to people about this place at any given chance","My stay at Maha Shanti Villas was an enchanting step into serenity. From the moment I arrived, the staff's warmth and helpfulness were evident, I was truly grateful for their assistance in arranging a taxi to collect me from the airport in the evening.

Nestled amongst lush plant life, each villa shares a sense of tranquility and natural beauty. The room I stayed in was nothing short of gorgeous, offering a perfect blend of comfort and aesthetics. Surrounded by verdant rice fields, the setting was nothing short of idyllic.

The amenities at Maha Shanti Villas added an extra layer of joy. A refreshing swimming pool provided the perfect respite, and the inclusion of a massage table for open-air massages was a delightful touch.

The breakfast, a delightful spread of delicious, fresh, and an omelette, was a delightful start to the day. The peaceful surroundings, coupled with a large comfortable bed made my one night stay just magical.The surroundings and the homely feel made me reluctant to leave. Maha Shanti Villas left an indelible mark, and I'm already planning a return for a more extended stay. If you seek a haven of peace, friendly hospitality, and unparalleled natural beauty, Maha Shanti Villas is a definite must-experience retreat.","The staff here are divine - so genuine and helpful üôè I stayed here for a couple of nights while completing my YTT at Blooming Lotus - it‚Äôs just around the corner and easy walking distance but the Maha Shanti staff very kindly gave me (and a couple of other YTT students who stayed here) lifts to and from for a very reasonable price. My room was very clean, bed was huge and very comfortable. The pool is also really nice, looking out over the rice fields. Can highly recommend and would stay here again. Thank you for having me Maha Shanti üôè‚ú®","Stayed here only for one night, but it was amazing. A bit outside of the noise and chaos of Ubud, exactly what we were looking for. Lovely property, the little wooden cabins are very charming, super clean and have top notch bathrooms. Nice pool with rice paddy view; super friendly and helpful staff. My only wish is we could have stayed longer.","Amazing villa with amazing infinity pool facing the ricefield. The villa only have a few rooms but new, clean, spacious, and have a comfy big bed & cute bathtub. I heard even some rooms have their own simple kitchen. They dont have refrigerator or TV but I could just stay all day laying on the sunbed looking over the view. The service is good, all staffs are friendly and present alldays & nights in workshifts make us feel safe. The breakfast & coffee is good too."

When i injured my foot and was unable to walk, i was treated and cared for like a member of the family
I look forward to seeing the Ashraya family again soon :)","An absoulete Gem!, the rooms here are fantastic. Very clean, spacious and the area has strong WiFi. The swimming pool is lovely to relax in all day and it's a short bike journey into Ubud. Very quiet area that is surrounded by rice paddies, an on a clear day you get fantastic views of the volcanoes. The family that run the Guesthouse are really friendly and incredibly hospitable. They really make you feel at home and part of the family. There is space for you to park a bike and it's walking distance to an Indomart and on the main road there is a great man selling papaya, snap peas, pineapple etc. If you ask the fruit man he will help you buy Tempe and Tofu from the markets as well. When I come back to Bali I will definitely stay again with this family at the Guesthouse. Thank you guys so much for everything!","I stayed here for 10 days while doing a silent retreat at Blooming Lotus. The owner was so caring and helped me when I had a problem.
