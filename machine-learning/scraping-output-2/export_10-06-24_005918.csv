We took the nirwana villas, simple haven right on the beach. Basic bungalows (lots of bugs but it's normal) but what a treat to sleep with the sound of waves, and amazing views in the morning. Very secluded and still within a minute of the splendid pool (almost empty as all other villas have their own pools). Subtle , minimalist luxury","My stay at Komeneka at Keramas Beach , Bali was nothing short of magical. Nestled right on the pristine shoreline, this resort boasts not only breathtaking views but also an ambiance that truly transports you to paradise. The rooms are elegantly designed with a perfect blend of comfort and style, offering a serene retreat after a day of sun-soaked adventures. The in-house swimming pool overlooking the ocean is a dreamy oasis, providing the ultimate relaxation spot. But what truly sets this resort apart is its exceptional food and service. From gourmet delights to local flavors, every meal was a culinary delight. The staff's warm hospitality and attention to detail made me feel like royalty throughout my stay. Whether you're craving a tranquil beach escape or a luxurious getaway, Komeneka exceeds all expectations. I can't wait to return to this slice of heaven.","I'm always coming back here each time we visit Bali.
The room is spacious, well equipped, squeaky clean, has a smart tv, good internet access, all in one you ever need in a room.
The room pool is large, and you can see a clear sea view in a glance. And the best part is that you can see the sunrise and it's serene.
The hospitality is top-notch! Very kind, friendly, and accomodatable.
Super satisfied and always enjoy my stay here. It indeed feels like at a second home ❤️","I stayed at the resort for a week, the resort is beautiful with warm lighting at night, i booked the one bedroom villa with the private pool, the rooms have great privacy and the staff will always try their best to satisfy any personal requests. The resort also has a private beautiful clean beach. Although i enjoyed my stay i should mention that the resort has some wild animals that can be noisy at sometimes ex. Dogs barking at night. It is a bit far from the major areas in bali (which is something that i wanted personally) which comes with peace and quiet. The beach view from the room is spectacular!","The hotel is amazing and the staff is very nice, professional and welcoming. The location is great and villas i consider as one of the best.
Very quiet and relaxing  hotel, the view was amazing as it has ocean view from a side and the nature from the other side with an infinity pool view.
Highly recommended"

You can came here if you through By Pass Ida Bagus Mantra street
Good place and good vibes
But need some improvement in food and service
Price is good
Thank you","Delicious Babi Guling. I was the only tourist there and it was busy with local people. You know you are at a great place for Indonesian food if it is full of locals. The owner was really friendly and welcoming. The restaurant itself is by the beach, it’s nice and breezy and very clean.  I would definitely go back and recommend to family and friends.","I was starving and excited to try out this new Pan Jonar new “babi guling” restaurant that I had heard so much about. It was supposed to be one of the best in town, with a beautiful view and amazing food. I arrived at the restaurant and was seated promptly, but that's where the good experiences ended.

I waited and waited for my food to arrive, checking my watch every few minutes. 39 minutes passed, and my food still hadn't arrived. To make matters worse, the staff kept walking around asking customers to give them a 5-star rating on Google Maps. Clearly, they cared more about their ratings than the quality of their service.
When my food finally arrived, it was far from what I had expected. The chair I was sitting on was too short and uncomfortable, especially for a man of my height. The steamed meat still had staples in it, and the most expensive menu item, a crispy pork skin, was not found. This is the only restaurant I have visited that not gave me pork skin on their most expensive menu.

To top it all off, the cashier was incredibly slow, and the cash register was disorganized. Took so long to get the change. The quality of the food, the service, and the atmosphere was not worth the hype and promotion that this restaurant had received. The only good thing about the place was the view and the straws made of reusable material.
Needless to say, I left the restaurant feeling disappointed and frustrated. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.","Beautiful ocean view Babi Guling place and it's got a impressive rice paddy view, ocean view seating for a simple Babi Guling place. Babi Guling itself was delicious, pork crackling was perfect and the meat full of flavour and very tasty. Tucked in a small alley, but well worth it as it's got great view and food was delicious. Such a value as well as we paid 100k rupiah for 2 Babi Guling, one beer and a bottle of water.",Plz don’t go here! Foreigners charge different prices. There are two menus.They give expensive menus to foreigners . Be careful! I ordered based on the domestic price. I pay twice as much as I pay

It's a new and modern building with an incredibly well kept garden and perfectly clean pool. The room is big , clean, and the bed and very comfortable. Desi and her family is amazing. The breakfast is wonderful. highly recommended.","Uma Dewa Homestay in Keramas offers a cozy and authentic Balinese experience. The rooms are simple yet comfortable, set amidst lush gardens. The location is ideal for exploring nearby attractions, including Keramas Beach. The staff is welcoming and eager to assist. Great value for budget-conscious travelers","The property was easy to locate and off of a major highway. It’s a little gem set back off of a side street. There’s plenty of parking whether you’re driving a motor scooter or a car. You walk in and it’s all landscaped beautifully. There is a full kitchen with appliances for use. A pool table and a pool. The room was fabulous and clean. Plenty of light with numerous windows. Upgraded electrical fixtures and lighting, a small refrigerator, a large comfy bed, and a beautifully done bathroom with a strong and hot shower. The owners were fabulous and wanted to ensure that your needs were met. They are also extremely flexible and will do whatever they can to meet your needs. The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors and the highway traffic. But it is not the fault of the owners. Pack some earplugs and you’ll have a pleasant day","Desi is absolutely wonderful. Everything is impeccably neat, clean and loved. The Internet is fast, the beds are super comfortable and the air conditioners work well. The pool is sparkling clean and there’s even a pool table. This homestay is excellent value for money, we highly recommend it to anyone.","This is a small affordable oasis. I enjoyed my stay immensely here. The room was a perfect and decorated beautifully. I loved the small desk, small fridge, air conditioning and small closet shelves in the bathroom. Every morning I walked across the street and down the less traveled road to the beach and then to a nearby beach cafe for breakfast up by Keramas surf spot. Desi, the owner, also arranged for me to get a scooter and surfboard. I ended up getting really perfect overhead Keramas surf. I also visited a nearby Sababay Winery and went to Kebon vintage cars as well as Gianyar while here."

Frits (The Netherlands)","Beautiful place set in the most beautiful setting among the rice fields. Only a 5 minute drive to the incredible black sand beaches and surf breaks. ‘John Wayne’ and his family were the best hosts making us feel like it was our home too. Our last night they cooked a feast for the 7 of us and organized a cake for a surprise birthday for one of our friends. Truly special.

Wayan's wife made delicious authentic Bali meals for me.  The location is peaceful and picturesque, set amongst rice paddies.  The accommodation was very clean and of high quality.  And there was also an inviting pool to swim in.  Highly recommended.","Great location, great people, extremely helpful and a host you can hire if you need a great driver. Pool is great, big barn doors. Can walk to beach if you want to. Host can also help you get scooters if you like. Loved my stay here stayed for around a month with nothing but good vibes.",Temuku Family Guesthouse was one of the best places I had the pleasure to stay at. The owner and host Wayan is one of the nicest people I met during my two months of traveling around Bali. He takes the family-part very serious so although I was travelling on my own I never felt like I was alone. He will help you with just about anything. The house is very new and the rooms are big. I could not have asked for a better experience. If you want to stay around Keramas and can't/don't want to afford one of the resorts look no further.
