It's really misty and cold. The flowers are really pretty too.

Many temples here and tourist attractions such as petting zoo and photo opt. Also  some cafe and restaurants here. Family-friendly place as there is a playground and many animal statues for phototaking. Super pretty lake to look at too.","I went to Bali at the end of October.
I visited Bedugul at 2 p.m
You can see the temple in the middle of the lake.
the situation was crowded and also very hot.
For me, the most impressive experience was seeing tourists praying at the temple.
The least memorable thing was getting stuck while riding a duck boat on Lake Bedugul.","I went to Bali at the end of October and visited Bedugul

You can find souvenirs such as clothes and there are also lots of foreigners there

I like it there because the weather is cool and not hot","I went to Bali and I visited  Bedugul at 03.00pm  in the end of October.
There are many temples in here and pretty lake to look too. The weather was sunny and cloudy, the situation was crowded and pleasant.
In there i took a picture with foreigners, and I played a rowboat in there.","I went to Bedugul in the end of October with my school, Unicore.
There is very beautiful view with several temples in it making the atmosphere even more sacred
Many local and foreign tourists flock to this place because it is located in the highlands which makes the atmosphere cool and calming
I enjoyed my time there for quite a long time and taking photos with friends."

Greeted by Putu and Gara we arrived at our home for the night and like many times before comfort is assured in their cosy Bungalows.
With the mist coming in around 6 pm its time for a hot shower and dinner in their log fire restaraunt. Yes a log fire. The restaraunt menu offers local and western options at very good prices also. Darma and the kitchen team we say a special thank you.
Then back to our bungalow for a good nights sleep on their recently improved mattresses.
The wifi is stable, good size flat screen tvs also if not want to nod off straight away.
Breakfast delivered by Darma is included in the morning to your bungalow as well. Now thats service and at the prices they charge for the night its extremely good value here.
Special thanks to Pak Gede who introduced us to this hotel a long time ago and Ibu Ira who does bookings.
The only negative is we cannot stay another night or two in our bungalow we have grown to love.
Well until next time that is when we see Strawberry Hill Hotel and Restaraunt again.",Beautiful cottage and a cozy room. Weather was nice too. Had no issue on humidity in the room. Another fine cottages from Poppies Bali. Will go back again.,"Really upset that we booked this hotel. Many insects, sounds all over night (motorbikes, crickets). Room is dark, no AC. Also the in breakfast we found hairs, and the fruits were without taste. Do not recomend","For a three star ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è hotel this place really punches above its stars. It‚Äôs humble, but the bungalows are great and so much effort put in to make you sleep well. Bathroom and hot water is awesome. No Mini bar, but the menu is basically room service. The included breakfasts were great! Highly recommend staying a few nights to try all the breakfasts ü§§. The staff were so accommodating and friendly and were more than happy to shuttle us all over town - just ask. I would definitely stay here again. Oh yeah, no beer on the menu, but they have a fully stocked bar üç∫.",We recently blocked 15 rooms to accommodate our family and guests for our son's wedding at  Rumah Gemuk. Our guests and us had such a fabulous stay over the week end and the staff were so helpful and friendly! Place is really charming and the garden looks so well maintained... Thank you for everything... .

If you‚Äôre looking for something very relaxing and away from noise this is the spot for you. Villas are very cute. With an incredible view of the mountains. About a 15 minute walk from the hotel to the town for restaurants, but they serve breakfast there as well. Highly recommend!","The staff were very friendly and always helpful and eager to make our stay pleasant. The room was quaint with a private bathroom with towels and small bottles of soap, a comfortable bed, tea/coffee/kettle, TV (I didn't watch it), a sofa and dressing table. My room also had a small balcony facing the valley with a table and bench. As all the structures are wooden cabins, they have gaps in the walls, so be prepared to have mosquitoes, snails, and other tiny creatures visit you. I had two ""resident"" snails in the bathroom, which I named Humpty and Dumpty.
You are also likely to be woken up by the amazing dawn chorus and cockerells.

The hotel also offers a modest menu, which is either cooked on site or brought over from a local warung. The food was tasty. You can also buy bottled water, some cold/hot drinks, and dry pot noodles.
When coming into the compound, you'll need to pay a one-off 10,000IDR tax. There are a couple of warungs just up the road offering a small selection of cooked dishes and various drinks, local crisps etc. The lake is a very short walk away. There's a concrete promenade where many locals come for a romantic picnic, for fishing or riding scooters. It is all friendly and unobtrusive. You'll get a lovely view of the lake, town and mountains. To get into town, it is either a short taxi ride or a 30-minute walk along the main road.

As this is a mountainous area it can get slightly cooler than other parts of Bali, it can also be more rainy. The clouds can be low enough to hide the mountains as they rolls into the valley. Be prepared to get caught in sudden showers. On a dry day the sun rise can be stunning and it's well worth walking to the lake to watch it. And even better, to go to the exquisite Ulun Danu Bratan Temple and watch the sunrise as a backdrop to this sacred place.

One thing to bear in mind is that if you're after a more up market hotel, then this place is probably not for you.","Room was cozy. But 2 nights that we stayed was cloudy sky and rainy weather. So temprature in the cabin was just enough for people who don‚Äôt mind chilly conditions.

We could not enjoy the terrace because concrete bench was cold.

There were ants in the cabin. At night 4am neighbours from tottaly differenr facility started their scooter and went off, later went back. So it was not so calm during the night.
Cabin itself is with poor insulation and noise protection so you can hear most of the sounds clearly.

No room service during our stay. But there is TV with netflix, coffe, tea, wifi, toilet paper, towels. So we weren‚Äôt missing anything.

No restaurant or breakfast available at the facility so you will need to go in the nearest village to explore and look places to eat.","Rooms lovely, the food in the restaurant no so good.","The title ""Deluxe Villa"" it's a little bit overrated.

Simple wooden cabin in the traditional style on the country side with a small terrace, bed, bathroom fits better. Fresh air everywhere. No food or drinks are offered. In walking distance to the lake and far away from the noise of the main road.
Very far also from every possibility of a Restaurant and food delivery is not available.
WIFI works and we paid 450.000 IDR / NO breakfast - the price is ok!"

It could be truly foggy here especially after 3 pm.,This new spot to stop by near Bedugul was cool! You can go picnic or fishing. The scenery was incredibly mesmerizing your eyes. No entrance ticket. Easy to reach.,"It‚Äôs a decent walking path around the lake Beratan. There aren‚Äôt proper parking and there is quite a lot of trash around.
It‚Äôs more a spot where the local gather for fishing and chilling. The view is nice but nothing breath-taking.","I will rate it 5 stars if the place have no rubbish, too many of them, pls clean up...#33millionmalaysiancleanbali or #4millionbalinesecleanbali......I like Highland a lot, the cooling weather, fresh air, I stay in Malaysia, tropical country, hot whole year round, cool weather will be super nice for me.",Good

The area is peaceful, lush and the view of the lake and surrounding hills are amazing! Love it!","It is a promenade , a concrete walkway with many local people. The pictures of a temple are misleading , there is no temple.
There is a checkpoint on the access road demanding 18000 rupiah , it also controls access to the mountain trail nearby.
It is hard to see why a walk beside a lake is worth 18000 , the checkpoint was closed by 4pm which is also a good time to be there with a sunset view across the lake",Beautiful thats all i have to say. Its located around the shortcut till you find a small road a bit bumpy. This place is so quite. And good for relaxing breathe the fresh air and see the beauty of Beratan lake and Batukaru mountain. No entrance fee here which is good. Toilet and warung also available around.,,
