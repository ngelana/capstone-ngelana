5. Overall this is a star hotel with excellent service and facilities.","One of the best properties we've stayed at, their service is absolutely fantastic. Right from the time we've checked in, to each day of the stay, the team has been very kind enough to accommodate all our needs, queries and maintain top notch hospitality. Breakfast spread is sumptuous and for a vegetarian there is a surprisingly huge variety of dishes to choose from. Lunch dishes were also well made, with delicious taste.  They do provide coffee / tea in the afternoons and a shuttle service every 2 hours to the Ubud central market. Location is walkable (10 mins) from Ubud, with numerous restaurants on the way to choose from if you wish to eat out. Also a quick service 24x7 Mart is situated right outside the hotel for any urgent purchases. Kudos to the team for having served us so well during our 3 nights stay at the property.

While reading other reviews, I see folks complaining about stairs/ lack of lift- suggestion is please request / inform the staff well in advance. Im sure they would try to accommodate such requests , as we had requested for non-smoking rooms.","Really enjoyed our stay at Best western premier Ubud. Staff was very friendly, helpful and always with a smile! Hotel itself is located about 5 minutes from the Ubud market with free shuttle service. Breakfast was pretty good. Would definitely stay there again when we come back to Ubud.","Overall the service is outstanding,  especially  front desk agents Gede and Bayu. They gave excellent  service.  I've never been to BW hotels that have full service 4 star hotels. Full buffet breakfast, laundry service,  Spa, fitness center,  infinity  pool and shuttle  service  to the market.  Location in a quiet neighborhood  of Ubud. Very save and they have money  changer across  the  street."

The location is also nice as the ubud market is close by and the resort provides free shuttle. Everything u need is provided in a room. They provide free water and also provided 4 complimentary drinks and cookies. If u r a vegetarian there are a lot of varieties which u can't find everywhere in Bali.,"Dwaraka The Royal Villas stands out as a boutique hotel with a distinct charm. The atmosphere is serene, making it an ideal place for relaxation. The service at the hotel is exceptional, with staff members who are attentive and always ready to assist. The on-site restaurant is a highlight, offering gourmet dishes that are both unique and upscale. A special shout-out goes to the head chef for creating such a delightful menu. The a la carte offerings are comparable to those found in high-end dining establishments, adding a touch of luxury to each meal. The architecture and landscaping of the hotel are simply stunning. Every detail, from the intricate stonework to the thoughtful garden layouts, showcases craftsmanship that can be likened to art.

I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Ubud, as it promises a luxurious, culturally rich, and relaxing experience.","An amazing place about 15-20 minutes drive from up north from Ubud Palace. The entrance is not quite obvious, but the rooms are excellent. Very picturesque and have a romantic vibe to them. Breakfast is complete with fresh juices, pancakes, tea and coffee, bread basket which comes with butter and muffins and croissants. Rooms are maintained with attention to all.the delicate details. Staff is meticulous with their management and service.  Had the best time here while in Ubud. Highly recommend for anyone travelling to Bali/Ubud for the first time.","At last. Sitting here in my Dwaraka kimono gown thinking back to our amazing days in Ubud.
We had the perfect welcome by super friendly staff who go above and beyond to assist. People of the world take note what hospitality is meant to be. They have nailed it. We then whisked off upstairs to the open plan restaurant for an afternoon tea (cocktails) and a bite.
On day 2 we had the pleasure of meeting Komi who is one the drivers. We immediately booked him to host us on our day tour the following day. It was such a joy spending the day with him. AND it was his birthday. Stopping at a couple of temples, volcano and coffee plantation. Komi was not just our driver but a super guide and it really felt like 3 friends exploring. He exuded a love for Bali for that is rare to see in other countries.

The accommodation was just the amount of lux we were looking for and the massages were dreamy. We had a private dinner set up for us in the garden which was a treat in local flavours and abundance.

We can not recommend Dwaraka enough. And are looking forward to returning for a few more days next year.","We have just returned home after an AMAZING stay at Dwarka The Royal Villas.We spent our entire 2 weeks here in the hotel in a One bedroom villa with private pool and rice field views.From the moment we arrived in the lobby after almost 24 hours travelling from Ireland,I could feel myself relax and be welcomed by the lovely smiling faces of the reception staff.
The villa was big and bright and the views from the pool were amazing and made you feel immersed in nature even though we were only 5 mins from the centre.
The shuttle bus was a big plus and runs ever hour from 8am and we used that most nights.We ate in the hotel many times and loved all the food we had.I really looked forward to our breakfast each morning and the staff were always so warm and welcoming and smiling.
We had room service several times for lunch which we had by the pool and there was no dish that we did not enjoy.
Ubud itself is a wonderful area and we did several day trips with a brilliant driver that we were lucky enough to meet(feel free to message me for contact details of the driver).
I could go on for much longer but suffice to say that this is a wonderful property where you can relax in nature and be surrounded by warm and caring staff.
I would be very happy to recommend this hotel to all my friends and family.

This was my second visit; my first being for breakfast where I enjoyed a delectable avocado toast with eggplant and two extra eggs, paired with a unique drink that was perfect for my recovering stomach.

Today, I opted for a chicken dish accompanied by mashed pumpkin and vegetables, which was simply delicious. Although I can’t recall the exact name of the dish, every bite was delightful. I also tried the fresh coconut, which was a refreshing treat.

The ambiance at Muse is inviting and the staff are attentive and friendly, always available when needed. My overall experience was flawless, earning this place a solid five out of five. I highly recommend Muse to anyone seeking a great dining experience.

Additionally, they feature a live band at night, which I have only had the chance to hear in passing, but it certainly adds to the vibrant atmosphere. In summary, the food is outstanding, the quality is top-notch, and the prices are reasonable. Muse is a must-visit.","This restaurant was a great find near our hotel.
The food is very healthy and varied, with reasonable portions.
The service is excellent, and they are quicker than other places in the area.
For breakfast, we paid an average of 120,000 rupiahs (Bali).","We came in for desserts. Excellent place. Will be back Thursday when they have live music for dinner.
Dinner is excellent 👌 Large portions and great food.",Loved the vibe here and the indian fusion options were really delicious. Whatever we ordered on the menu everything tasted good,"Choco smoothie was awesome first time.

So i came another day to try food. They had no strawberry, no peanut butter, no sourdough bread. They offered me to make avocado toast on another type of homemade bread.
Then they said they had no sliced avocado and offered to do it smashed.

As a result, it was on a sweet brioche, questionable and bad-looking."

We had the garden room or suite 6. We like it a lot except for the toilet, where the flushing panel is broken. The shower is outdoors, so be prepared for occasional bugs and insects to be present while showering. Just outside our room, we have access to a more private pool than the main pool at the restaurant.","I absolutely love and adore this place. What a surprise. I stayed in the River villa and shared with a friend. The staff are wonderful. The spa treatment was amazing. Complimentary yoga, yes!
There was a little gold fish pond in the bathroom. The pool is surrounded by jungle. The bedroom opens up to a patio that has another patio or outdoor lounge area. The design is genius and the details are unimaginable. I love the complimentary tea time. Worth every penny.","An absolute, exceptional place to spend your vacation for pleasure or business  , has great service , super nice staff in the resort and at the restaurant too.

All their food was delicious, especially breakfast!  I've never seen my children eat that much in the morning in my life!  We arrived late at the Purist Villas and my youngest was passed out.  The manger carried him all the way down to our villa, up the stairs and into his bed.  When we left the front desk, we took a brief detour for the manager to show us where the restaurant was located. By the time we got to our villa our bags were already there!  Thank you for the most wonderful experience.  We were sad to leave, but would pick you again the next time we make it to Bali! ❤"

Lovely views of the rice fields  from the pool.  We just got back 5th Jan 24 .

There are two medium-sized pools, with one offering a scenic jungle panorama!

Thanks Sparks","Walked passed a few times and only today that I decided to have breakfast here.

Kitchen not ready to make any smoothie bowl so I ordered something not really my usual breakfast (I am a small eater).

Everything is nice, staff asked how I wanted my egg to be done which they did exactly. ❤️🙏🏻🥺 Thank you. They are delicious.

And, I would like to make a little suggestion to the cafe owner. Maybe it would be nice to separate the guacamole and all the wet toppings from the toast. Or make it an option for customers to have the toppings stack or separate. The toppings wet the sourdough until the bread is so soggy.😭 I understand most people will cut and eat the combi all together. Sourdough is hard to really cut easily.😔 Maybe cut the sourdough into two pieces, easier to pick up and eat with hands?

Just a suggestion 😀. I will definitely try the smoothie bowl here when I come back to Ubud again.","Beautiful space and lots of seating space. It was mostly empty when I went. Good place to work for a few hours. Friendly staff. It rained heavily when I was there and it was fun sitting inside, working, and watching the rainfall.","Gorgeous place recommended to us by view just a few minutes walk away.  Lovely and quiet and away from hustle and bustle of inner Ubud. Very clean with lovely decor.  Food was delicious and such great value for money.  We had Garlic Chicken and Quesadeas (forgot to take pic), mocktail and ice tea.  Mango parfait for dessert also delicious!! Such super friendly service by two young enthusiastic staff.  We'll be going back for coffee and lunch in day time."

The air conditioner started leaking water and formed a small puddle, which the staff luckily had been able to fix. I woke up in the middle of the night of loud noises of some tourist couple with kids bathing in the pool at midnight, right in front of my own porch. No respect of other guests. The hotel guests are not warned to take a shower prior to using this small community pool. Menu didn't include any vegan-friendly options and was very outdated. Finally, there were several malnourished stray kitties coming directly to my see-through room door trying to beg for food and harassing my own indoor-only rescued kitty, which made us both feel quite uncomfortable. Any offer of any insincere inhumane treatment of such animals (anything other than rescuing them and feeding them or offering them to some sincere animal-friendly volunteers shall be considered as animal abuse and violation of all global treaties such as UNESCO or World Animal Fund).","Nice place to stay. Very friendly staff. Some problems with water in shower, didn’t run away. Location good, 12 minutes walk from Ubud central street. We rent a scooter, so it’s take 3 minutes. Nice pool in apartament. In kitchen not have sharp knife to cut somthing, example, fruits. Would be happy for a slightly bigger breakfast. Overall - really good deal. Highly recommended.",Great place to stay. My son and I stayed there for 2 weeks. Clean and modern with lovely staff. Great location. Approx 20 mins walk or 5 mins bike ride to the main town. There is a mini mart and a few restaurants nearby.,"Beautiful location! The rooms are gorgeous and very clean. The personel is so very nice and the food is amazing, we had a wonderful breakfast.

Great breakfast, comfortable rooms and an awesome garden/pool area. Located just a short walk from the main street, the resort was super quiet.

These villas have a private pool, an open outdoor bathroom and a very good air con. They have a laundry service and airport transfer. The reception is 24 hours. The spa service was lovely too.

We will be back 😊😊😊","Stayed for 4 nights and loved it! Very modern and clean. Great friendly service. And a delicious breakfast from the cafe at the front of the villa which we enjoyed both there and from room service!

Having the private pool was perfect to cool off after a day exploring around Ubud!

Looking forward to visiting again soon!","I stayed in Mahayoga for all 12 days of my stay in Ubud. The staff are all so friendly, room and pool is clean and so spacious (more than expected tbh) and beautiful. I enjoyed my whole stay thoroughly! It’s definitely worth the price and the pictures are very accurate as well. It is convenient if you ride a motorbike. Be aware that as most places in Ubud are near rice fields or have a more jungle vibe, there is bound to be more insects (ants, mosquitoes, flying bugs etc) but nothing a bit of repellent can’t fix 😊","We have really enjoyed our time at this wonderful place. The rooms were clean and the air conditioning was perfect.
The staff couldn't be more helpful, always smiling and helpful.
Thank you so much for everything,  we'll see you on our next trip to this wonderful place","Best of all hotels we have tried in Bali. Very clean rooms, clean water in the pool, service is perfect and personnel is very friendly.

The room cleaning also happens very quickly. They also provide very nice body wash, lotion, hand wash and shampoo. Overall, it was a very good experience staying here.","Superb friendly staff, good location walkable coffee shop, restaurant and mart.
Amazing experience here. But the only thing that matter is the smell coming from the sink below the shower room but they also have this spray on wall, it is automatically spray every 8am in the morning.","The service is impeccable, they are genuinely friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable for a great price. My partner and I sadly got sick on our second day here and had only booked two nights, we dreaded having to check out because we were completely bedridden - but thankfully there was one room left. After having spoken to the reception, they informed us that we could stay in our current room instead of move around! When you have a fever and walking to the bathroom feels like a challenge, this is truly a blessing. I would recommend Chandi to anyone. Thank you!","All new rooms
Much more extras than other similar places.
Lots of lights in the room.
Kettle, tea, coffee, small fridge, umbrella, hair dryer, disposable dental kits.
Bed is nice, but pillows too thick to my liking.
AC smooth and quiet.
Nice little balcony
Shower is good, but the glass door is not closing completely, so water comes out.
Surprisingly, there are not towel racks to hang the towels...
Also, would do well with a chair in the bedroom as well.
The TV is larger than any other hotels, so far.
But no cable channels connected, only Netflix.
Pool is nice.
The food for the hotel is quite overpriced.","This is my first stay in Chandi. This is a new hotel. The vibes are clean minimalist. I love the room! They are compact, well designed, and have anything that I need. They provide complete toiletries just like an expensive hotel. The swimming pool is clean and the water is quite warm."

It's a sweet little concept cafe with a small but well curated menu. I like the way we get to create our own combinations. The food was very tasty and very filling.
