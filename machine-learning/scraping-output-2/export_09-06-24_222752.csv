The view from the top overlooking the sea was absolutely stunning. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. I was particularly impressed with the cuisine in the restaurant; the food was delicious. I highly recommend trying their homemade pasta. For those who need to remote work, the hotel has fast/good WiFI. The large swimming pool is also a great feature. Highly recommended for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.","The hotel is under construction, very noisy and lots of construction workers on the property, like 20 people, who also sleep around the pool.
We left 10 minutes after check-in. Very disrespectful to the guests. Provided that we booked the room through booking, we were refunded only part of the money! But, it was not mentioned on booking that there is a renovation. I dont recommend this hotel because it is not respectful to people who spent 7 hours on the road to come to this place.","Nice view friendly service but
The rooms service laughing as they saw the dead insects . 2-3 it’s absolutely normal but arround 40 in the bathroom?!  I have been to many rooms in Bali and nowhere’s it  like this .
I checked out 1 day earlier !","Really great location, though it's in a bit inland. Food is pleasant but not really various. The workers are quite helpful.

Actually room is spacious, but I found lots of insects and cockroaches are coming out of nowhere:(( i can't even sleep at night","Verry good place toe stay when you need to relex,no stres of trafic.The staf is verry help full but they need better training."

The villa is nestled in a stunning location with breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains and countryside.

The villa itself is beautifully designed, with spacious and tastefully decorated rooms. The bedrooms are luxurious, with comfortable beds and high-quality linens. The bathrooms are modern and well-appointed with all the amenities you need for a comfortable stay.

The infinity pool is the centerpiece of the villa and is simply amazing. The views from the pool area are breathtaking and it's the perfect place to relax and unwind after a long day exploring the local area.

The villa's staff is exceptional and provides top-notch service, making you feel at home and ensuring you have everything you need for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The housekeeping service is thorough and attentive to detail, ensuring that the villa is always clean and tidy.

Overall, I highly recommend Villa Joglovina to anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing vacation in a stunning location. The villa's combination of beautiful design, breathtaking views, and top-notch service make it a truly five-star experience.","Stayed for a week in August 2022 with partner and another couple (supposed to be more of us but our other friends got struck with COVID and had to cancel). The villa itself is amazing! The architecture and construction is beautiful. The rooms are all fairly equal in size except the master en suite villa. None of our group actually used this room because the bathroom was outside via a pond that was a haven for mosquitoes! However it's a stunning room - they all are. Some of the things we loved:

-Super friendly staff who sorted out breakfast and dinner for us during our stay. The food was generally really tasty and always generous servings.
-Incredible views of the coast
-On-site massages organised by the manager were great value and good quality

The north of Bali is very quiet so don't expect nightlife. It's also not so easy to get to the town if you don't have a car (no grab in this part of the island so need to book a regular taxi). It's perfect for a relaxing retreat. We used it as an opportunity to go diving for a couple of days whilst having a nice base to come back to and rest.

As some of the other reviews have mentioned, the villa is getting a little tired in parts. Some of the sun beds, decking, poolside furniture could do with a refresh. The pool filtering stopped during our stay but was fixed quickly. The coffee machine was broken and apparently not ready to fix so no espresso based drinks. For the price, they could have added a Nespresso machine or similar to replace this for guests while waiting for the machine to get fixed. We found the management to be very courteous and friendly with none of the issues highlighted in some of the other reviews. For a unique stay on Bali this villa is highly recommended. We were sad to leave!","Villa Joglovina is a beautiful property located in the heart of Bali, Indonesia. The villa has a breathtaking view of the surrounding rice paddies and lush greenery. The property boasts a traditional Balinese design with modern amenities, providing a luxurious and comfortable stay.
The staff at Villa Joglovina was friendly, attentive, and always available to assist us.","Good view Lovina beach from this villa in North of Bali, bad access from denpasar but its worthed!!","This is an awesome find for us. Tuck up north of the Bali Island away from the hassle and buzz of Seminyak and Cangu, it's a great escape and start of our Bali trip. We took a private hire van ride from the airport and it took us 3 hours to get there.

When we arrived, there were people waiting for us with welcome drinks and meal. They kept a constant communication with us throughout pre arrival so they know when we get there. They helped us with our luggage and everything.

There are 4 private villas to ourselves. So we have 2 spare bedrooms unused. The view from the villa is spectacular not to mention watching the sunrise.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. The cooked us breakfast lunch and dinner!

The design is very Balinese and autjentic. Apparently, the structure itself was imprted from Brunei.

The infinity swimming pool is of good size and temperature.

Not far from the villa, there are supermarkets. The villa would provide with transport to and from the supermarket. The also offer in house massage which was great and relaxing too!

This villa was a heaven for us withint the 4 nights of our stay. Everything was just perfect! Meals were fantastic"

Truly luxurious. My only possible detraction was a mix up with breakfast (we believed ti was free but upon arrival were informed we'd need to pay) and the higher than average prices charged to get to and from the villas from the airport (around $100 each way though them). Aside from that, the service as astounding especially during breakfast and dinner which is provided at the main villa by an in house chef. Would recommend.","Breathtaking view, and wonderful bedroom, the staffs are amazingly helpful and friendly.  Definitely a place to go,to escape from your hectic life. Try also the food served by their sweet chef Komang Sri, she will surprised you with her dishes..","Nice cottage with private pool, very clean, with a beautiful view. the staff is very helpful and always smiling.",Awesome view.good rooms.

The most incredible place to stay…. Felt like a resort all to ourselves. The evening sunsets were out of this world. The photos do not do this amazing place any justice. Our first visit to Bali for our 25th wedding anniversary has exceeded any expectations. ‘Made, Luh Tu, Gede’ and everyone else who took care of us ..we are missing you already and it’s not been 24 hours yet. You made our stay unforgettable and the reason we most definitely will be coming back.","Where to start. This villa oozes luxury. We were blown away with the size, layout , features and quality of this private villa. Our villa staff were amazing and went out of their way to help make our stay here unforgettable. Incredible pool, spacious rooms multiple areas to relax or socialise - we felt very spoilt to be here. The staff also spoilt our daughter on her 13th birthday here which was a beautiful surprise. We wish we could stay forever.","I never take the effort and time to write a review, so this is my first. Because I could not find anything about this unique spot in Bali I decided to write a review, to share my experience with you. So, below you can find my attempt to capture this unique villa in Bali with words.

The villa is located in the north of Bali, close to the coastal town Lovina. The north of Bali and Lovina itself is very quiet and you won't come across many tourist here. I had the luck to spend half a year in Bali for my graduation tease at the University. Most of the time I have spend in the south of Bali. Here tourism has increased enormously and pieces of the original and real Bali are disappearing, flooded by a wave of tourist. Restaurants and tourists ""hot-spots"" have been pulled out of the ground. If you come to Bali for relaxation, or/and enjoy the beautiful surroundings and culture on the island, you can still find this up north.

Villa Sing Sing is placed on top of a hill and located higher than rest of the villa's you find here. This allows visitors to see the most stunning view during the day. At the end of the day when the sun slowly sinks into the sea, there is even a more beautiful sight. The sight is reaching so far that you can spot three peaks, one peak of Gn Baluran and two peaks of Gn Ijen, of Java. This gives the most stunning picture I have jet seen on Bali. It's a pity there are mosquitoes on Bali, otherwise the bedrooms would have been an unnecessary luxury. During the nightfall a spectacle of hundreds of stars appear in the sky. This unique sight is only visible on this part of the island. In and around Denpasar there is too much light and smoke pollution to behold these huge quantities of stars.

The villa is the ideal setting for a luxury dream holiday, having space for eight adults and two children. It has 4 enormous two person bedrooms. One master bedroom pointed to the ocean, one bedroom above the master bedroom with a balcony and view to the ocean, and two others having a view over the mountain pointed at Java . All four rooms have a huge luxurious outdoor shower, completely in the style of the island. For the design of the building the architect made clever usage of the remaining space between the master bedroom and the other  three bedrooms. This space has been transformed into a children's room, where also a playhouse has been built into.

The master bedroom can be opened entirely, creating a magnificent panoramic view. All rooms are finished in detail and custom made woodwork. In addition, they all have quiet air conditioning and curtain rails, that are sunk in the frame of the villa, making sure the sun and heat are completely excluded from the building. The villa is a special piece of architecture and construction, the large spaces in the villa are kept open by a small space between the bearing walls and the roof. This ensures a light cool breeze of air comes in, fresh wind supplied by the ocean. Because I am allergic to pollen, this is a big plus point for me. The staff is very well instructed and makes the most amazing dishes, you can ask them for anything. I am a true fan of Chicken Curry and Gado-Gado, which taste more than perfect enjoying the scenery during diner. The best thing is you won't notice them and they speak excellent English. Altogether this is by far the most beautiful place where I stayed on the island. And by far the most beautiful villa in the north of Bali.",Stayed for 5 days and it was amazing. The staff were very friendly and helpful to order cars and activities ❤,

The location was peaceful and quiet, making it the perfect place to study and unwind. Overall, we had an enjoyable and productive stay at Rumah Senja and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a serene and comfortable retreat.",A clean and beautiful villa surrounded by nature and peace. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. My kids favourite part of the villa was the infinity pool which overlooked a forested area. They jumped in the first thing in the morning and last thing at night! Getting there from the airport was a breeze thanks to Nining and Henny who assisted in making transport arrangements. Henny was also always ready to assist with things like getting a masseuse over for a massage session and with getting us booked on a Dolphin Tour and so much more!! The meals Henny prepared for us upon request was always so sumptuous. It was also a wonderful experience bonding with the family over a poolside BBQ session while watching the sun set n playing in the pool on one of the evenings during our stay. I highly recommend this villa if you want to be away from the hustle n bustle of being in the city. My children couldn't bear to leave and even kept asking to go back to the villa instead of our own home when we were enroute to the airport for our flight. Thanks to all at Rumah Sunja for your kindness and hospitality. We already miss you!,"Beautiful place, I with amazing view of the Bali sunset, will need transport as it's a5 it's at the end of the world","Private Villa, which is very cozy,  quite,  and comfort.",Nice view
