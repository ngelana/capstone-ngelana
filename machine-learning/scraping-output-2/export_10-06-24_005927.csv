The food tasted good.
The service of the staff is Nice. Friendly staff.
But,*****
The food here is overpriced. (3 times )
Simple Example of a very small water bottle: 330ml for 13.000 IRp.
Chapati 47000 IRp","We ordered paneer pakora, aloo parotha, egg masala, chicken Tikka masala. Paneer pakora,Aloo kebab  and aloo parotha was excellent, other dishes was ok. Good service, well maintained and interior looks good. It's a massive building. It costed us about ~ Rp 700k. Pls note  wireless payments are not accepted",Had a great indonesian seafood meal! Cumi sodong+ padang sauce was really awesome,"Stopped here for a Javanese dinner during my local tour. Bakmie goreng is pretty good, as with the ayam bakar. Tempe goreng is not greasy. Staff didn't serve the gado-gado together with the gravy until we asked for it. The sayur asem was a fail, no young jackfruit inside, even the taste was way off. Only the interior decoration is praise-worthy. Spacious dining area.","Stopped by at this restaurant on the way to Tanah Lot. Really beautiful üòç. You will be dining to the sounds of trickling water from fountain in the courtyard. They serve fresh seafood as well as Indian cuisine. We opted for Indian - Butter Chicken , Naan and 2 lassi. It was fantastic! Everything tasted yummy! They also have many vegetarian options. The restaurant staff were very friendly and courteous! Overall pricey, premium dining option if you are looking to spend on quality food."

it was about 8pm when i came and there were total 4 people (including the barista) inside üò≤ well no wonder since it located in a kinda remote touristic location that the street is jammed on its peak hour before sunset hour and about an hour after that so no wonder its closing hour is 9 PM (which is the earliest sbux closing hour i have ever experienced üòú)

The barista that evening was okay, friendly but not as chatty friendly as the other sbux chain in downtown Renon (they are seriously THE BEST in town and most of them know me by name and some even remember my sbux order!!!)

I would definitely recommend this place for those:

- looking for quite place to work on your computer (but not sure the level of noise during daytime, i will have to come by to check again during that hour)

- those chatty birds looking for a safe place to dig deep your latest gossips..

- those looking for a great inet connection with much less hazzle login and great speed..

- those looking for a nice comfy couch to catch up with your reading and lots selection of tea coffee and sweets

can't think of anything else for now, in conclusion.. I can only say I wish this kinda sbux open somewhere near my home 24/7 (read:  the point is ... just come and visit and prove me wrong ... in a much nicer complicated choise of words üòã)

pro:
HUGE car parking space
NO Queue when order
Seat available.. by loads...
Quite ambience that you can actually listen to sbux's jazz playlist
sooo many more that I deserve a free grande for all those praise ü§£

cons:
airport price
(well that's where sbux rewards come handy üòç)","It is a right place to relax your feet after walking around Tanah Lot. The place is really comfortable and spacious. We really need refreshing drink in a hot sunny day, so I bought iced green tea to refresh my throat. It was sweet and fresh,Well they did it happily.

Here is my review.

Beverage review

I have been order the mango tea large (IDR 9.000) and Thai tea large (IDR 10.000). For price is great, not just the price is great, portion is massive, but who make I so happy is the quality of the beverage is excellent. Like 5 stars hotel bar.

But how about the Toast??

1. Barbeque beef patty toast (IDR 20.000). The barbeque sauce is good. But unfortunately the patty texture is strange for me, not like patty you know. Rate 7/10

2. Honey mustard chicken crispy toast (IDR 20.000). Perfect match between chicken crispy and the sauce. But the chicken is dry. Rate 7/10

3. Chicken karaage mentai toast (IDR 20.000). Chicken nice and juicy, good match with the sauce. Rate 8,8/10

4. Cinnamon sugar toast (IDR 12.000). Absolutely superb. The one and only place to find cinnamon toast in Kediri. The filling is unexpected massive. And the flavor is rich between butter and cinnamon sugar. Definitely my favorite so far. Rate 10/10

For all the bread are perfectly toasting. Great job

Service are top notch. The man behind the booth is great job. Fast but details.","Refreshing & Delicious.üòçüòçüòç And very affordable ü§ë
