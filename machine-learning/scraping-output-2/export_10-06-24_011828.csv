And we were damm hungry on our way back. Spotted this small beautiful restaurant, very limited breakfast menu items. But i found it very neat and clean, it also has a spacious parking and toilet facilities. Food was also great and tasty. It was priced fine. Very welcoming staff .","Had my brunch here ..
Great view cuz i can see GWK Culture Park
I can say 9 out of 10 for the coconut
But food? Ok ok üòÖ","Seems people living in this area will never need to worry about food, because this amazing restaurant is here! Don't know what took me so long to finally try it, but the food was wonderfully delicious and fresh. Big portion, friendly staff. Great spacious place with awesome view, breezy, relaxing.",Loving the food and the ambience.. i ordered grilled shrimp with rice and nasi goreng as main course.

The people who work there are so lovely and caring. I loved the open air concept around all of the lodging. The occasional pack of monkeys! Birdsong. Beautiful sunrises. I enjoyed my room at the surf shack. we even had a private pool! The food that was prepared for our group included, extensive gluten-free options and vegan options as well. The warm bread that they baked every morning for breakfast was over the top. Delicious! It was located in a very good area that allowed us to move in different directions in a relatively short period of time. I absolutely love the salty breeze. I felt completely safe there. I cannot wait to get back there!","Stayed in the Jungle room and loved the seclusion and privacy. Great view overlooking the ocean. Even had some monkey visitors! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They went out of their way to make sure my stay was special and even coordinated some extra surprises for my group. Ordering meals and snacks was very easy and paying for items was a very simple process. Don‚Äôt skip the ice cream or mie goreng! Also loved that there were activities on site like surf skates, yoga, and massage!","A quiet gem 10 min from the beach - very humble, peaceful and unique! Each suit is different style - I stayed at Tree house and Hut - the price is super cheap for the quality they offer. I wish I could book earlier and take bigger and fancier room - they have some; but this place is normally fully booked. They have cafe with full survive, yoga and surf classes and all amenities. Simply heaven and once I back to Bali - I will stay here again ü•∞","Fantastic experience! The staff is courteous, friendly and always smiling. Rooms were super clean and you have all the amenities you need directly at the resort.

FYI - location is somewhat remote but we preferred this and intentionally seeked this quiet getaway","We stayed in the Canopy, it was a luscious room with an amazing view. The staff were very friendly and catered to all our needs. The place is about a 10 minute drive away from cafes/ bars etc., although getting around with transport was very easy. Would highly recommend staying here!"

(They opened on April 2024) From here you can reach all the beaches around the peninsula in few minutes, while staying in a calm and quiet place, with a gorgeous pool area and the ocean view. The villa was beautiful and big, cleaned every day. The staff and the owners are amazingly friendly and nice. They also rent their own scooters for a really good price. Best place to stay in Uluwatu.

It's mostly quiet, but the rooms are very poorly noise-isolated so you'll hear everything that is going on outside including bikes driving a few hundred meters away.","very high quality, clean, stylish villa. the owner is a nice guy who takes care of every guest","Good vibes ..

It's even better than the pictures! Every single detail is perfectly thought out, and our hostess really went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. I honestly can't imagine why anyone would give less than 5 stars.","Amazing villa & staff We have stayed here 2x. We booked directly through their website to get the best deal possible for the first time and as we know the owner, we booked through her directly. We have booked 3  bedrooms the first time & 1 bedroom the 2nd time and to our surprise we had the whole villa to ourselves (it can fit up to 8 people). Location is a bit secluded which was perfect for us as we wanted to come back to a peaceful home after a day out & about in bustling Uluwatu. Some days we just stayed in the villa because we just loved it so much and ultimate relaxation. The host were helpful with their guides. Easy to get taxis or uber for the area. The cook Ros & security Juju are extremely kind. Always smiles on their faces. Excellent breakfast. We also had Ros made lunch & dinner for us during our stay. The host were helpful when I left my phone in local taxi and helped me track it down and talked to the taxi driver to return it to the villa. Overall, amazing stay and would always come back.","I don‚Äôt know if this is available for rent this year, but be careful, there is loud construction just few meters near this house",Cozy,Wow...
