However, it was an unpleasant experience due to the below:
1- There is no staff to communicate with. You get to connect with the manager on whatsapp and this is where it ends. Just be aware that it is not a serviced hotel.
2- Arrived to the room to find the fridge unplugged, smells bad, and we found remaining toilet paper from the previous guest in the washroom.
3- We came back to the hotel and the room wasn‚Äôt cleaned, so they just apologized for not knowing that we left the room. (Although we said good bye to the staff upon leaving the hotel)
4- The hotel is very close to a loud entertainment outlet, which was even closer to our room (the single floor villa).

The place has a great pool and the room itself is decent. It is just either understaffed or the existing staff who is supposed to help you out is inexperienced.","Dear Uluwatu team,
Thank you very much for your hospitality.
We love the service, the people, and the room is very clean and beautiful. Me and my partner we had wonderful stay and we will definitely recommend your place to our friends.
Stay safe everyone and keep that energy you have xx
Clara and Saimon.","Was a super cute stay and would definitely recommend! Great service, everyone was super friendly. Very close to many great places in Uluwatu (around 10min to various restaurants and beaches). Wifi doesn‚Äôt function well upstairs but aside from that everything was great. Also make sure to turn on aircon when you arrive, takes a bit of time to cool down but it does work.","A cozy place. Only 5 houses, a large pool and two hammocks. The house is 2-storey, on the second floor there is only a bed. On the ground floor there is a sofa and a workplace. The bathroom is spacious. There was only one towel available. It is written that the beach is only 450 meters away, but in fact it is a 20-minute walk. The internet is weak and practically does not work on the second floor. There is no breakfast.","Pretty place with nice, friendly staff and owner. Only drawback was in our room there were gaps in the door which led to lizards and mosquitos inside the room. Lost our sleep for two nights in a row"

This family accepts their guests as close friends during their stay and makes them feel welcomed and appreciated. The guest house has a perfect location for those who want to be away from the city rush and noise, but at the same time be within arm's length of distance from the most beautiful beaches, beach clubs and famous tourist attractions in Uluwatu. The pool and garden area are very well maintained and it is a great place to get a really good tan during sunny days. The kitchen area is clean and provides everything you need. The rooms are clean and look exactly like in the pictures. During our stay, there were also 2 adorable puppies, which with their playfulness and cuteness made this stay even more memorable and pleasant. We highly recommend choosing this place for your stay in Bali and booking already for a longer time, because places like this get booked quickly and people want to spend more time there.","New brand place.
Owners are very friendly. Dasi is super! :-) they became my friends.
You can rent here a bike, if they have free one.
Big rooms with pool view. Big comfortable kitchen with everything you need to cook.
There is a bike parking under the roof.
Very silent place. no noisy neighbors.","We stayed here for two weeks. Ketut and Made are the friendliest hosts I‚Äôve met. They put their heart and soul into their homestay. The rooms are spotless and the pool is very nice. The location is close to some beautiful beaches and viewpoints with incredible sunsets. It‚Äôs about 10 minutes drive to most cafes and restaurants. It‚Äôs quiet, with lots of beautiful singing birds and we even saw some monkeys around. I would stay here again and recommend it to my friends!","Our first stop at Bali. Very nice homestay with cosy garden and spacious room. The room was clean (with nice fresh flowers) and the A/C working without any problems. The Bathroom was clean with hot water. It is possible to rent a scooter directly from the owners. Bike was in good shape - made a day-tour through the whole Bukit. Location 3-5 Min. (Bike) away from Uluwatu temple / Nyang Nyang beach and other sights where you can either chill / take cool photos.
Would recommend this homestay, would visit again. Was a very nice first introduction to Bali at the start of our trip.","Tiny and cosy Homestay in Uluwatu area. We just stayed for two nights but would have been here for much longer. Staff is very friendly, feeling more like family. It was the perfect start of our Bali Vacation to calm down.
