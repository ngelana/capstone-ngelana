We enjoyed our full 5 day's in July 2018.

1. The view was incredible!
2. The rooms, the pool and the garden were always clean.
3. The personal was very friendly and helpful.
4. The food, which were cooked live from the cooks, was very good.

I would recommend the villa for everyone!","Villa Luna is the place to be. When you are searching for a calm place, you are right here. Outstanding location, impressive view above the sea and the coast. The villa style is modern but with many Balines decorations. Home made food. You can have cooking lessons with the young chef as well. The whole staff was friendly and courteous all the time. The villa manager was very helpful during the whole time of our stay. The villa, especially all of the bedrooms and the pool are very clean. Comfortable beds and linen. Nice garden furniture. No TV but fast WiFi and two sound boxes. Sometimes, in the evening hours, you are even able to hear Gamellan music from the village nearby what gives you an impression of the typical Balinese life. The villa is located in the hills of Lovina, some steps away from a small village. No restaurants in the neighbourhood. Around 15 Minutes away from Lovina. We visited the villa with our two teenagers and they have been feeling themselves very comfortable during our stay.
We have visited many villas at Bali in the last decade but this is one of the best.",Paradise on earth to share with respect nu anyone wil comes here. A great staff and the best food made by cook July and Juni.,"Amazing view, amazing place!",Love this villa
