The accessibility to there is pretty fine. The road can be accessed by car or motorbike. I didnâ€™t expect that I would get good internet connection there because the temple is located at the hill. When you arrive there, you will see the inscription that tells the templeâ€™s name. On the left side of the temple, there is a wide parking lot. To reach this temple, you must walk and climbing up the stairs. Itâ€™s not that far from the first stairs (maybe around 100+ stairs?). From these photos, you guys can see that the atmosphere there is really calm and cool. The temple area is clean too. And also, thereâ€™s a toilet and wastafel outside the temple.",Great temple and sacral place good for meditation,Much better than all those touristy temples. Authenticity and calm here. Must do.,Nice for spiritual journey,"first time, i'm coming. Hopefully next will come againðŸ˜„"
