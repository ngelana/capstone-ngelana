The view must be stunning on a fine day.
This warung is strageicaly located on a busy road.
Clean toilets are available downstairs

Unfortunately the premises are not clean.
There are many packages of snacks available that are probably OK
The cooked food is Baliinese style but not fresh ‚òπÔ∏è
Food was handled by hands which weren't cleaned first üôÅ

Would I come back again ü§î
