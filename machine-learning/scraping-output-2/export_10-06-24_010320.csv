We enjoyed our stay in the comfy villa. The beds are comfortable and it had everything we need. It is in traditional Balinese style which means the living room is an open area. There's a safe upstairs, but we felt comfortable leaving our stuff in the open room. You have a private garden and you can close the gate, but you can't lock. Which was totally fine by us.

Ofcourse you might run into some ants and small lizards. People who complain about that, don't understand the concept of being in the tropics. It comes with the territory. But everything was spot on clean. The cleaner who comes everyday even does your dishes.

The pool is clean too. Staff is super friendly. There's staff on site 24/7. In the evening and night there's security.

We recommend staying here. Our kids loved it too.","We stayed in a villa which is in a different part of the property. Villa was good. You have to remember that this is a 2 star property and it certainly delivers value. The attention to detail is very good. Staff are great. It is far enough outside of Canggu to be peaceful. The only thing if it is important to you is that you cannot lock any doors, but it wasn't an issue.","Really friendly staff (the local staff at least), and set up is nice. Rooms are very dated and not well maintained. No water pressure in showers and overall a dirty feel. Multiple kids were sick in the hotel, which was most likely because of the pool. Would not go again.","Really enjoyed our stay here, super friendly and highly accommodating staff. The rooms are super comfortable and I like that it is away from the noise and traffic of the major streets. The breakfast at the cafe was a delicious way to start every day. Highly recommended.","I had a great time at united colors of Bali! The rooms are clean and the services are excellent! If you need peace and quiet this place is for you!

I love the idea of this shelter-caf√® so much, and the entrance is free!

I'm super glad my friend and I decided to look up for Cat Caf√®s in Bali. This was such a nice discovery and on the same way as our destination, Tanah Lot, so you can easily fit a visit to this place in the itinerary!

The actual caf√® is quite hidden, but Google maps and the signs on the walls helped us find the way. I suggest parking on the main street and go on foot from there, since the streets are too narrow for a car.

The cats are super adorable and friendly! I believe there are more than 60 cats at the time I'm making this review. Moreover, you can order drinks and food inside for yourself, and for the kitties! The prices are very affordable, and you can always donate for the cats in case you just want to support the caf√®.

The photos look nice, but the build quality is poor. Why does that matter? Imagine a thunderstorm night and you heard a banging sound on the roof as if the builders forgot to nail a section of the roof. Enough to make me stay up all night. The door locks are so poor that they can lock you up by accident at random. The glass door next to the kitchen overlooking the pool cannot be fully closed, letting mosquitoes in. Not to mention the road to the villa is extremely small, fitting only one car. Virtually no parking. At this price point, not okay.","We stayed in a villa of this complex, they are all the same management.
It was made in the cheapest way possible to maximize profit.

Customers are cash cows and nothing else.

Villa was very dirty and poorly maintained.

Electric system not safe, not connected to the ground.

Definitely not worth the price asked.

On a good note the area is quiet and staff is nice as always in Bali.","Nice villa, a good location and perfect for couple traveller","I will stay here again! Amazing place to stay, the place is simple and it's near cafe also"
