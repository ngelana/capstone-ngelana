All the staff is very helpfull and kind. Recommend this place 100%!","I really wanted to like this place. The beds are comfortable, the view is nice and the staff is super kind and helpful. I stayed in two different rooms. I changed from the first one as the mouldy smell was too much and everything was incredibly dirty.

They didn‚Äôt have time to clean as I checked in early, fair enough. But after a night I needed to change room. The smell improved but there are many defects on the wall that they‚Äôve painted over. Bathroom lamp did not work. Tv didn‚Äôt work in the first room. The new room was still dirty ending in black feet after walking in the room. I ended up sweeping the floor myself and baby wiped the surfaces of cupboards, door handles etc, all the wipes ending up black from the dirt coming off.

I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs an issue with cleaning standards or if the equipment is dirty itself. The staff are super kind though."

They also have activities everyday that the kids can participate in for extra tokens ‚Äî these are different everyday.  We‚Äôve also left him in day care for 1/2 day and taken swim lessons.

Their food is also pretty good and their staff is very attentive. The playground itself is covered so they can play even when it rains.","This place is a GODSEND! It has the most epic playground, the coolest pool and toddler room. I get to just kick it and drink a coconut and eat awesome food while my daughter plays. I have been DREAMING of a place like this while in Bali!!!!!
If you want to have a date night while you have the kids this is the place to go!! The staff are soooo nice and the food is awesome . Can not recommend enough!!","Our son loves this place! There are so many things for him to play with and climb on and there‚Äôs a cute restaurant with food and drinks so parents can hang out and eat or work. They have a kids club, a huge playground, a trampoline, a pool where they offer swim lessons and they have movies on weekends!
Highly recommend this place!","The playground is awesome for toddlers. However, we just wanted to stop in and let our toddler have a quick play and grab some refreshments. The price-tag for our toddler to play being 150K was very expensive. Sure, it‚Äôs valid for the day, but we were just popping in. Maybe a pricing model per hour would be a good option.","Visiting from USA and found this super fun play area for kids and relaxing spot for adults! The frozen mojito mocktail is delicious. I also highly recommend their Best Beef Burger, it‚Äôs mouth watering good. Easily one of the best burgers I‚Äôve had.The only thing I wish this place had is a few more additional toys and etc for the kids! Very fun playground and play area though, and very clean."

Just the price which for me is too expensive. 100 k would have been perfect.","Today my daughter & I visited the Cheeky Monkey Cafe and WOW is the first words that came to mind.
This is a parents dream, to release there children in safe, interactive, play area - which was massive! Plus they had a pool there, so don‚Äôt forget to bring you bathers.
The food choices was amazing and everything was delicious üòã
As soon as you enter, there is someone who greets you and opens the safety gate to welcome you into the cafe. Which put my mind at ease knowing that my daughter couldn‚Äôt wonder off.
There are interactive activities on everyday. Today was face painting, learning how to make Traditional Balinese Offerings and Mini Mixologist (Strawberry drink) - just purchase a token for $10,000RP ($1AUD) per activity.

Zahra had the Hot Diggity Dog (Hot Dog) and it was so creative, how it was presented.
I had the ‚ÄúBoost you Immune‚Äù Juice and the Curry Chicken Wrap, with a side of fries - 10/10 üòã

This is such an awesome space for the digital nomad parents to work from and watch their kids play.
Such a wonderful family friendly space, which is extremely safe and they have staff cleaning regularly.

All the staff are friendly and very helpful. I highly recommend visiting this place for a date night, while your child go off to play.
There are heaps of events for parents and children.
Plus you can host parties there - winning!!

Go check out their instagram page and there full menu! All of the kids food is shaped to an animal or sea creature.",This has to be the worst restaurant in Ubud. I was excited to try it out. Oh my how dissatisfied I was. The space is really attractive but that‚Äôs it. We were 7 and All of us had a poor meal. Whoever designed the menu and portions needs to be replaced. I had the pumpkin salad. There were 4 pieces of pumpkins the size of my pinky. The lettuce portion was the size of my fist. No value. Truly an Ubud rip off.,"We come here all the time to work so our son can play in the play area. Great atmosphere. The food is pretty good and reasonably priced.

Their kids menu is good portions. They have chicken nuggets, fries, hot dogs, pizza. Basically all the kids food.

We usually sit back with a coconut and get the uluwatu bowl (tastes like chocolate ice cream), salads and cappuccinos.

We love supporting this place. It‚Äôs one of the few places in ubud specifically designed for children.","We love this place! Great food, great ambiance and there‚Äôs a playground so our son can be entertained while we relax. There‚Äôs so much for him to play with and climb on, they also have a trampoline and a pool where they teach swim lessons too. The owner, Tammie, is so sweet and will give lots of recommendations for the area and places to go. Highly recommend this place!"

Quiet but close enough to fantastic Ubud restaurants, cafes etc. Staff very friendly and helpful. Organised scooter hire and taxi service- very attentive. Thanks","The place is clean and suitable for group of family or friends. We have stayed one night and truly enjoy our time.
Pros
1. The room is spacious and clean. AC working perfectly
2. The bathroom is huge and has bathtub which really convince for us whose traveling with kids.
3. The access to the villa is easy, due the location is really close to ubud center.
4. Their extra bed is massive, the size is 160x200 which really comfy.

Cons
1. Lacking in amenities,
2. No TV
3. The kitchen has lots of utensil, however they forgot to put the pan which really essential.

Overall compare to the budget we spent, the experience is worth. We believe that the property could be a huge success in the future.","Lovely place and super friendly staff, we could also hire a scooter on the spot. Chezzy was very helpful with everything we wanted to know. Room was immaculate condition and prices very affordable. I would recommend having breakfast at the hotel than going out (if you want to save some money of course) it was delicious and cheap.","People are excellent and friendly. Place is clean and comfortable as expected. Breakfast is awesome. I'd stay here again.

They had to charge me 5% extra for credit cards, that was a turn down. Pool is much smaller than it appears in the pics. I'd avoid any services inside. Rentals, laundry, water everything is marked up 300% from what you can find nearby.","Comfort place to stay with your family.
The staff very friendly, their pool was clean enough, they have few option for breakfast (soto and bubur kacang ijo)
There's two things for note, at the time we come, their water heater was not working, hope that they fix the heater immediately.
And if you bring car to this place, their parking lot quite small, so be careful when park your car."

We called it the rice paddies penthouse.
It‚Äôs perfect to work from home. The office view is so beautiful!

The beds are really good quality. The personal who assists you is really nice and professional.

The kitchen it‚Äôs practical and well equipped. Of course it doesn‚Äôt have everything, but we lived here almost 2 month and we can‚Äôt complain.

We have a beautiful time in here, I highly recommend it if you are considering it.

It‚Äôs a little bit far away from Ubud, but if you rent a motorbike it‚Äôs perfect! More quiet than staying in the middle of the town.","A beautiful property located  in the middle of the rice field. It was quite peaceful and relaxing, exactly the way we intended our vacation to be. The place looks just like the pictures. The manager, Juni and Pranata were super helpful and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable.","Amazing villa just in 7min from Ubud üòç
The view is breathtaking: sunsets and sunrises in Rice fields...  the villa is clean and comfortable for family. We enjoyed our holidays. Thank you to accommodate us","Highly recommend Villa Tulsi! My girlfriend and I stayed there for 3 months last year ‚Äì it was great. We looked at many places in Ubud and Villa Tulsi was an easy pick (although, rarely available... I guess we got lucky with our timing!) Juni is great! üòä",It's a perfect place for short escape from a busy city because it's surrounded by rice fields. But not too far from Ubud center as well.

This was NOT the case. The Villa is located just behind a small farm which makes it impossible to enjoy anytime day and especially not the night. There are many dogs barking all night non stop and the roosters and pigs also don't stop making noise. Also the main water pump is directly behind the master bedroom which is obviously broken or crap as it goes on and off every 2 mins and is very loud. We got no sleep. When we arrived at the villa there was also hardly enough equipment for a long stay, only 1 set of sheets on the bed, no towels and not even enough spoon or suitable fridge for long term. The drinking water dispenser was filled with algae and made us sick the first days. We had to buy a new one ourselves as the staff was unapologetic and not willing to do anything about it. We spent a week organising his staff to get this stuff for us and at the end still had to buy extra things to make the stay bearable. In addition to these issues, the pool was always dirty, with algae growing in it and always at the bottom of the pool. The staff couldn't seem to fix this and no one took us seriously. The quality of the cleaning was bad, often always having to tell them what to do. The water in the taps smelt like rotten eggs or dead animals and was horrible to shower or wash in.
We left the villa for a few days and when coming back we see that the staff had broken in and taken the drinks and food from our fridge and consumed them!!!!
From the beginning we were trying to contact the owner to help us and he was NOT interested in us. After we handed over the money, that was it! We ended up leaving the villa as sleep deprived and RIPPED OFF. We contacted the owner many times to try and reason with him and got no leniency, not even a small partial refund for the hassle and extra cost and time. This guy knows nothing about customer service or being a host. Even looking at his other online reviews for his other Villas around Ubud, it's clear we are not the first ones who's had problems. AVOID!",Nice places I love it,,,

We got plenty of time on top to enjoy the sunrise and hiked slowly back down.

After that, I got a personal driver who took me to the hot springs, the coffee plantation and the rice fields where he waited an hour at all the places until I was done. I loved all the visits and really recommend these for everyone!
