Gianyar, Kabupaten Gianyar, Bali, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=5106445050309897606,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 4791690,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.2,484,,Location is awesome. Service is great. Rooms are tidy and all amenities are available. We stayed in beach front cottages. You will have a private pool (little maintenance required) You have the options for floating breakfast. The shower and bathroom is outdoors thats a little scary. Property is pretty big and you can spend fun time here.,Guys be aware... there are poisonous snakes  all around... After entering the villa I saw a venomous SNAKE in the pool villa ( inside our room)... We ran for our life and did not stay there. There were lizards in the room which is common i guess. All the negative reviews are to the point the bare truth of the place. If you want to be safe (bare minimum ask ) please don't stay in that place. Moreover the staff's reply was we took out the snake now it's safe . Just think if one snake  we spotted within minutes of entering how many more will be there.PLEASE DONT STAY HERE. WORST WORST WORST. UNSAFE. Deserves -100 stars. I hope Google enable the option,"We lived here for 3 night 4 days .. we highly recommend this property ü§ó as this property located near beach area we saw insects & lizards but staff was very cooperative they helped us to get rid off from that. Otherwise staff is so helpfull food was limited but good in taste & view was superb & calming from anywhere.
Lastly we are happy to chose this property.","I was very excited to go to the resort as the villas had private pools and photos of the resort seemed pretty good. But my experience has not been good at the villa. The location of the resort is very isolated. The beach is very dirty, not at all maintained as construction work is going on that side. The main problem which I faced was that of insects and lizards. One lizard even fell in front of us while walking through a canopy of trees. Lizards were there in the villas too! So one cannot enjoy the property. At night if you decide to roam in the property bats might trouble you.
Now coming to the pool. The pool was not at all clean. Not maintained.
Food was average, not much options. Very limited menu. As far as drinking water is concerned they only give you four 330ml water bottles, and if you ask for more they deny. We had to purchase drinking water from outside.
The staff is nice and cooperative. Even the service is good. But overall the resort needs more maintenance.","This property is good. But the problem we had is with our private pool. The machine of the pool was not working and due to this our whole day was ruined. They offer us full body massage as a compensation which was not worthy at all and surprisingly they were not having any alternate option. It means if your pool machine is not working then you have to stay with it like what we did. On next day we forced them to make the machine working but the pool was so dirty that we could not enter the pool before 1 and at that time we took our floating breakfast
Very bad experience"

Really delicious food which was recommended by a local all the way from Sidemen as the place for Babi Guling in Bali.","Really good authentic pork dishes from Bali. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to eat some pork while on vacation.

The restaurant is not filled with tourists, and is mostly used by locals. The prices are fair, and the food is great.

I would eat here again.","Taste ok and reasonable price, if you go to Karangasem you can stop here anytime (open 24 hours)",came here at 11pm and their pig skin still crisp which is good. wide parking space. tastes like a normal babi guling restaurant.,A local guide recommended this place to us for Babi guling and we were not disappointed!
