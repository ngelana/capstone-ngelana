Better than the Aussie kfc for sure. Thank you my chicken wasn‚Äôt pink but well cooked.,First time having bfast in this place and really enjoyed it. Very quiet so make my bfast very confortable. I ordered hot chocolate and some pastry for my bfast. Definetelly comeback for lunch and dinner to try another obtion.,"This KFC has Krushers!

After visiting many KFCs around Bali and Lombok looking for a KFC with Krushers we found one near our place in Ubud.

Unfortunately the much hyped Krushers wasn't the best. Maybe we expected too much.","the response is very slow when serving, the queue is up to more than 25 minutes.  I've never had this happen at any other KFC","I visited KFC Gianyar last week and overall, it was a typical KFC experience in terms of taste and pricing. However, there were a few aspects that could have been better.

Firstly, it was a rainy day, and I was disappointed to find no canopy or shelter for passengers to enter the restaurant from their cars. It would have been more convenient and customer-friendly to have a covered area to protect patrons from the rain.

Additionally, I encountered a delay in receiving my order as the rice was not ready. I had to wait for about 20-30 minutes, which was a bit inconvenient. Ensuring all menu items are readily available during operational hours would greatly improve the dining experience.

On the positive side, the cleanliness of the place was satisfactory. The restaurant appeared well-maintained and clean, which is always appreciated. The staff members were friendly and provided decent customer service, creating a pleasant atmosphere.

In summary, KFC Gianyar offers the standard KFC taste at average prices. While improvements such as providing a canopy and ensuring all menu items are available promptly could enhance the experience, the cleanliness and friendly staff were definite highlights."

I do have the feeling that they suddenly charged 10% extra tax, it wasnt mentioned any where and the locals didnt had to pay it",Hidden gem. Not so easy to find off the main road but worth the visit. Excellent local freshly prepared food and great price. Lovely little garden too. Very friendly staff & owner. Highly recommend a visit.,"Great food and staff. The warung is very welcoming and has a lovely garden seating area,but with plenty of Umbrellas for shade. The menu has both western and local dishes and should have something to please everyone. My wife and I always eat there when we are in the area. Highly recommend a visit for great value tasty food","Found this great Warung in Gianyer whilst travelling back from Ubud. It is more like a Rumah Makan than a warung. It has a great choice of items on the menu and the ambience is delightful. Comfy tables and chairs in a beautiful garden setting. The food was presented perfectly and tasted absolutely delicious. We will definitely return again soon. A special mention to all the staff who were so lovely and accommodating . Speaking to the owner we found that it has only been open a week , judging from our experience it deserves to be a great success.","Amazing value for money, perfect if you stay nearby! Great food and staff. The owner is a super nice man that was more than helpful to us! Thanks a lot!"

We had Indomie noodles which came with a poached egg and some veggies.
One was the popcorn chicken Indomie and we ordered extra popcorn chicken with it. The chicken was actually quite good quality pieces.
Also ordered Tahu Jeletot (West Javanese fried tofu with spicy filling) which was delicious.
And we had the lemon tea and pistachio latte - both were refreshing.
The place is clean and looks modern - it feels newly renovated.
And they have their own branded crockery which is a nice touch.
We would recommend!","Derau Coffee has been my number one cafe to visit in Gianyar. It's small, simple, tasty, yet affordable. The ambience is relaxing and their service is never disappointing. If you want to work on something uninterrupted by loud teenagers, or simply read a book on a lazy day, just come here and unwind.","I didn't expect the menu to be so affordable, and the taste and quality are incredibly rich. The staff is also friendly, the rooms are clean, and they offer outdoor seating, indoor seating with AC, and indoor seating without AC for smokers.

If I had a chance to visit Gianyar area again, of course I will come back!","The Air Con was a bit hot, but the service and the coffee was really great üëç. The coffee was really good and the food is affordable definitely recommended place to hang out.
My third visit and i can say for sure this place is great. Keep it up!.","This place is just a WOW. The coffee is just out of the world. Super nice. And Uma is just very friendly and very passionate.

If you‚Äôre wanting to hire a car in Bali look no place else! Family run business, they‚Äôre so lovely and welcoming. Both upon picking up the car and dropping it back off, we had coffee, fruit and spent time chatting about anything and everything! In terms of the car hire itself, it was very professional. Our car was in great condition mechanically, had no issues. Got us around Bali perfectly, even with the steep hills and rocky terrain. Had to get to some difficult spots as I needed beautiful places to fly my drone! Thank you so much again guys, wish you all the best and hope to see you again in the near future!","My recent experience with Bali Cheap Car Rental was positive overall, providing good transportation at a reasonable value. The car was decent and reliable, getting us everywhere comfortably.  The staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating, including when we asked to extend our rental by an extra day, and their rates were competitive, making Bali Cheap Car Rental a solid choice for travelers seeking affordability and reliability in Bali.","Really an amazing experience. This is a local business with a soul. Made went out of his way to accommodate me, and the car I rented was immaculately clean and efficient.

My favorite part was the aircon, which if you‚Äôve rented other cars in Bali, is typically nonexistent at this price point!","We rented a Susuki Katana Jimny for 1 week and was extremely happy. The price was very good, and the car was in excellent condition considering its age, a proper vintage car! We loved it! The Jimny is narrow enough for the small Bali roads but powerful enough for the hills. It was a great adventure.

The staff were also fantastic, and really are what made this car hire experience stand out. We hire cars all over the world and the customer service here was excellent. They initially picked us up from our hotel, and after we were able to contact the staff on WhatsApp whenever we needed a little advice, including when we went to East Java to climb Ijen crater. This really helped ease this potentially stressful journey.

We would 100% recommend this company!","Very neat and friendly guy. His rental office is in the heart of ubud. We rented a car for around a week for an unbeatable price. The car was very good as we traveled almost all parts of bali with it. He will also offer you tours and told us some secret places to visit which was definitely worth it.
I would recommend this rental to every tourist who wants quality for a cheap price."
