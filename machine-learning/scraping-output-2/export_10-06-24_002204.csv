The first area is lawn garden, the next is a pond, then the monuments, then a garden with coverage from trees. The locals use the lawn area for as their park, and the track around for their fitness. It was free to enter, and there are food stalls and whatnot outside.","The Puputan Margarana War Memorial in Margarana village stands as a solemn tribute to the brave souls who gave their lives for Bali's freedom. The memorial serves as a reminder of the island's enduring commitment to its traditions, culture, and independence.

Great road trip destination. No entrance fee but you leave a donation in the donation box","A memorial park dedicated to heroes who had fallen in the war of Margarana, 1946, one of them is who we know as I Gusti Ngurah Rai, he led battle in frontline. Since the war happened long time ago, there's not much activity going on in this place, only some few people visiting their ancestors graveyard and all feel so peaceful and serene. There's a big monuments, plenty amount of graveyards and some ponds to feed the fishes.","Another brilliant stop on the way from Canggu for a fun ride through amazing scenery.

Beautiful place to stop and have a walk through the memorial.

We had an educational and wholesome experience.

There are some vendors and restaurants to serve you food and drinks.

We met some very friendly locals who recommended some other places nearby to stop and enjoy.

5/5","This place is not a real grave, just monument of our big heros that fought for our freedom. Around 1,372 heros fought in 1945 - 1950 and they came from all around Bali. The hall for meeting also available I  front of the monument. Inside the monument, fish pond surround the monument that collect some historical clothes and weapons during the war. And this place is famous for camping."
