It felt like home so quickly because of the sweet people that run the place. We are traveling with our daughter of almost 2 years and she loved it here. Ibu Putu had a son and they had great fun together. Chasing after the chickens or petting the cat. The staff was so sweet with her. We had a really good meal there one night and the other night we could order something. We got a ride to a waterfall nearby.
It sounds corny but it's a home away from home, with beautifull views and tranquil environment.
Thank you so much!","Beautiful place to come for cool weather, a peaceful, clean environment and warm authentic Balinese hospitality.
Ibu Putu and her team looked after us so well during our stay and went to great lengths to make us feel completely at home, with extra blankets (it gets chilly at night at this altitude), extra towels and providing hot water whenever we needed it.
This is a beautiful way to experience Bali, especially if you plan on visiting the lakes and waterfalls nearby, or you just want a lovely place to relax and get away from city life.","Our stay was absolutely fantastic! I can't say enough good things about this beautiful place. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with open arms by the most friendly and accommodating hosts. They went out of their way to make our stay memorable, providing exceptional support and warm hospitality.

One of the highlights of our stay was the amazing food they prepared for us each day. Finding good dining options in the area can be a challenge, but we didn't have to worry at all because their cooking was not only delicious but also gave us a taste of authentic Balinese cuisine. We looked forward to every meal!

The location of the homestay is a true gem. It's strategically situated near some of Bali's most beautiful waterfalls and serene lakes. Exploring these natural wonders was incredibly convenient, and we were able to reach them easily by car or motorbike. The surroundings are simply breathtaking, and being so close to nature made our stay even more unforgettable.

The accommodations were comfortable, clean, and had everything we needed. The hosts' attention to detail and their commitment to ensuring our comfort were truly remarkable. They provided valuable insights on local attractions, making our trip more enjoyable and memorable.

We cannot recommend this homestay enough. It made our Bali experience truly magical, and we‚Äôre grateful for the incredible hospitality and experiences we had here. If you're looking for a welcoming and authentic Balinese experience, don't hesitate to book a stay at this place. You won't be disappointed.

Thank you to the wonderful hosts for making our Bali trip unforgettable. We will be sure to return and, in the meantime, share our amazing experience with others.

5 stars doesn't seem like enough to rate this place; it deserves all the stars in the night sky!","Many people come to Bali looking to experience the authentic Bali. Pondok Kawinaya is exactly that: the construction of the accommodation, the design and decoration of the interior as well as the layout of the grounds, the abundance of plants and vegetation and the subtlety of the night lighting. All of these elements make you feel that you are really in the heart of the island.

Add to that, the wonderful warm welcome you receive and the fabulous Balinese meals that Putu and Nyoman make available to you. Both are mines of information about the area, what to see, how to get there and how to organise transport.

One extremely attractive addition to the property is the ‚Äúwarung‚Äù area beside the reception. It‚Äôs a great place to hang out and meet other guests. We stayed two weeks and wish we could have stayed longer.","Amazing place full of beauty and peace thanks to owners and staff of Kawinaya‚ò∫Ô∏èThere are a lot of wonderful waterfalls and lakes nearby.

If you choose this tour, be sure you're up to ""single track"" riding on steep downhill paved motor bike paths that are about 18"" wide.  Our guide Budi was very attentive and wouldn't leave my side, the vehicle Argus drove was very nice with good Air Con.  I give these two guides 5 stars!

However, the outfitter needs to give more attention to their bicycle maintenance.  I know this is Bali, and I empathize and wish them well with their entrepreneurial challenges, but the bicycles were barely in good enough condition to ride,  When we arrived, our guide was repairing one of them, and finally gave up and drove away to get a substitute.  I rode the bike in best condition, but it was slightly too big for me.  One of the helmets they offered had a broken strap, and the other two were too large.  They made sure the bike brakes did work OK, which of course was the main thing.

It's a fun adventure for a confident cyclist, it's a bit scary for a novice like me.","We had a fantastic day out with Edi and Ardi at the Twin lakes (Buyan and Tamblingan). They took care of us, made sure we has food, coffee, tea, water and sufficient rest. They were friendly and hospitable.

Fantastic views of the twin lakes. The campsite near Pura Ulu Danu Tamblingan was a quiet and peaceful location. Ideal to pitch a tent and enjoy the serenity. Next we headed to the Banyumala waterfall and we ended the day with a home cooked meal at a local home. Overall a tiring day but the sights were worth it.","My experience with this guided tour was absolutely breathtaking. We were picked up from our hotel in downtown Ubud right on time and escorted to the meeting point with our guide to begin our trek through the forest towards the Twin Lakes. Throughout the entire journey, we chatted, laughed, and had a wonderfully instructive and enjoyable time. Using a canoe, we reached Ulun Danu Tamblingan Temple and later visited the Banyumala Waterfalls.

Unfortunately, we encountered a torrential downpour, but the team promptly provided us with ponchos and assisted us along the way. At the end of the day, we had a family-style lunch and truly felt like a part of their family. The food was exquisite, and they even lit a fire to keep us warm.
