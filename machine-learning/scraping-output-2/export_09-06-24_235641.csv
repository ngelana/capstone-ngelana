To go to the bungalow you have to pass komang and his family‚Äôs house which is a very beautiful balinese house!

The scenery on the way to the bungalow is amazing aswell!

The pool is private, the kitchen is private with microwave, cooking utensils and a good size fridge- I suggest to bring your own comfort food supply from town.

However the bathroom is not fully covered.
Overall very recommend staying here, away from the hectic city to get some real fresh air!","Bali was my dream destination . Booking this place really made my experience beyond magical. Nature surrounding this place is breathtaking & I was never this relaxed in years‚ù§ Scenic view of Mount Batukaru, in the heart of Bali, total privacy, very reasonable price & many more. The host & his wife was so nice, we lived like a family for 2 weeks. Even their cute dog gave us company. Komang , his family & his natives oozes the hearty culture & hospitality of Bali & it's lovely peopleüíØ","Lovely location and great hosts. Both Komang and Putu are very welcoming into their small basic compound, and will go to extra effort to help your stay be enjoyable. Highly recommend if you want a true taste of the rural lifestyle.","Super cool local place to stayüõèÔ∏èüååüèûÔ∏è

I want to share my holiday experience in this family compound located in remote village in Penebel, Bali. The building where I stay is separate from the main building where the owner lives with his family and a very cute dog.  The building has two rooms, with a beautiful traditional Balinese design.  Apart from the incredible views of the mountains and rice fields, there are many other places to visit around the village such as several waterfalls and natural hot springs. The owner also took us to his family's rice fields, went fishing, swimming in the small river, and attended a traditional ceremony at the temple in traditional Balinese costumes.  We are provided with fresh organic food from their own garden.  I also tried their very good honey from their own farm.  All of that at a very affordable price. There's no public transportation but they provide cars and motorbikes to rent with the reasonable price.
For those of you who are bored with the hustle and bustle of Bali and want to travel in a quiet place, I highly recommend this place. I would love to come back here again one day.",It was good experiance to be a guest in this place. Awesome üëè,,,
