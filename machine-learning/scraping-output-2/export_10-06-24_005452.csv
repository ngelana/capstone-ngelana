They also give us welcome drink and Kuaci. I think this is very great","One of best plant-based restaurant I found in Bali, ALLIUM FREE, MSG FREE, no baking soda and baking powder as well.

It‚Äôs totally worth to be back again.
They have different special menu every day. This restaurant also have an awesome charity program. You can also visit the urban garden upstairs, lovely places and must visit!!! The most important is all are vegan! Good for your body, soul and nature!
