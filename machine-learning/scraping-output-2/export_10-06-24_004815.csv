The hotel is value to money. great staff. the only concern is they are telling higher prices than online listings such as booking. com but still worth it","Strategic location. Overall a good hotel. Food is also pretty good. The room view is not the best. For the room is quite comfortable, it's just that the bathroom is not well partitioned so that only want to go to the sink or use the closet so wet.","The hotel here is very comfortable, I stayed here 1 day 1 night. my room was very clean and neatly arranged. The swimming pool with a very beautiful view of the rice fields. The price is also not too expensive. If you come to Bali, especially in the Gianyar area. you usually come and stay here. The employees are also very friendlyü´∂üòç","Really well trained and friendly staff. Room is clean and comfortable, and very new. About 15 mins drive to Ubud and you can rent a scooter at the hotel directly. Rooftop pool and bar is excellent! Albeit there were some miscommunication about the swimming pool usage in my last night of stay, overall I think it's a good choice if you can drive and don't want to be in the city centre.",Room and services are really good but it‚Äôs 7 km away from ubud market ‚Ä¶ but worth it with price ‚Ä¶
