The hotel is really large and has lots of great facilities including the huge pool with (pool) beach area. Great for kids and adults!

The rooms are clean, spacious and pretty modern. The walls are a bit thin - so you might enjoy some of your neighbors chatter, but that doesn't have to be an issue.

We had a package that included some drinks, room credit, lunch and dinner. This is really good value for money - make sure to shop for a good deal!

The service and the staff at the hotel is very friendly and accommodating and the location of the hotel is nice, right in the middle of all the action of Kuta and close to many restaurants and shops.

The only downside for us was the quality of the food and the relatively small offering of different dishes at the dinner buffet. That's definitely worth improving.

Our son (12 yrs old) also made use of the kids/teen club which was fun but unfortunately already closed at 6pm.

All in all a really nice and recommendable experience!

Rock on!","Had a wonderful time here, visited twice in the past 10 years and can't wait to return. Always safe, clean and tropical. The air is sweet with smells of flowers. I enjoyed the pool and especially the pool bar, making friends and then enjoying short walks on the beach. It's certainly more expensive than other places but in my mind it's absolutely worth it. Keep up the great work!!","Absolutely brilliant and a kid friendly resort with a water park within the resort for kids up to age 10 or so.
Lovely spread of breakfast. Spectacular kids and teens clubs (separate). Activities for kids of all ages.
Amazing and spacious rooms and most importantly very very courteous team.

What a break. Can’t stop coming back here again and again.

My kid cherished recording a song in the studio and we got a USB as a memory for the same.","Hard Rock Bali is a true paradise. With its stunning beachfront location, luxurious accommodations, and impeccable service, it offers a remarkable escape for travelers seeking a taste of Balinese luxury.

The rooms are spacious and elegantly designed.  The attention to detail in the decor and amenities is outstanding. The pools located in the hotel is a highlight, providing a serene setting to relax and soak in the beauty of Bali.

The dining options at the hotel are exceptional, with a range of restaurants offering delicious local and international cuisine and not forgetting the legendary hard rock cafe.

The staff's warmth and professionalism leave a lasting impression. They go out of their way to ensure guests have a memorable stay, providing personalized service that adds to the overall experience.

Can't wait to come back again. Thanks for the wonderful memories.","Suggested for tourists coming to Bali as it is near The international airport. Breakfast is great, crowded as usual.

1 missing star for not having enough shade for visitors without purchasing something to sit under a beach umbrella.
It's nice before the stores open along the beach, which is before 8AM, you will get a quiet time also it will be less hot.","I love Bali and all the beaches I have visited so far. The day I visited Kuta beach, the skies were grey, the waves were choppy and there was nobody on the beach, so I'm thinking it wasn't a great time to do a review, but I have to be honest and review what I saw and my experience on my visit. As a result, I was really let down by Kuta beach.

There were a few stalls, bars and restaurants, but there was no atmosphere at all that day.

I will go back in the next few days and do an updated review.",Best sunsets! Plenty of places to sit down and have a cheap beer. Try not to get hussled by the workers on the beach if it's your first time. Be polite but firm.

Staff is good and service is prompt.

The restaurant and pool area can be upgraded to offer better view of the beach which is blocked by trees and shacks as of now.

Travelling from Delhi India","Perfect Stay in Kuta Paradiso Hotel in Bali!

I had an incredible stay at this hotel during my recent trip to Bali! From the moment I arrived, the warmth and patience of the staff were immediately noticeable. Each member was not only sincere in their approach but also extremely helpful, ensuring all my needs were met.

The hotel itself boasts comprehensive facilities that contributed to a very comfortable stay. The breakfast offered each morning was a highlight, featuring a wide variety of delicious options to suit all tastes. One of the best parts of staying here was the convenience of the location. The hotel is within walking distance to Waterbom Water Park, beautiful beaches, supermarkets, and a plethora of dining options. This made my stay hassle-free and allowed me to enjoy the best of Bali on foot.

Given the outstanding service, excellent amenities, and prime location, I would definitely choose to stay at this hotel again on my next visit to Bali. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a top-notch experience in this beautiful island paradise!","A 3 star hotel. The staff try to keep it tidy, however it is still full of ants and insects. Not suitable for people who are prone to allergy.
The hotel is old. Hence the quality of bedding and the furniture in the room.
Justified the price of the room considering the location. They do not provide good quality of amenities in the room hence i recommend you to bring you own soaps and shampoos. Also the breakfast was  average. Our package included the 2 massage sessions , however they denied the service for 3 days straight saying that the spa is full giving priority to people who pay on spot.","I stayed here for 3 days last week. The hotel was quite old but still good. The check in was quick and they gave me a welcome drink that was quite refreshing. The room was good, spacious enough and the bathroom was huge. It has separate shower and bathtub. Too bad there were no electric outlet available by the bedside, so I couldn't charged my gadgets while lying in bed.
Breakfast was good, overall. Plenty of options and taste good. The swimming pool was nice although I didn't spend that long there.
Very dissapointed when I was informed that I must check out at 11 AM though, due the hotel was fully booked and they didn't inform during check in and I was informed at the last minutes when I went to the receptionist to ask about something. If I didn't come to the receptionist I wouldn't have known. They gave me extra time though to check out at 11.30 after I asked.","Hotel personnel are good.
Hotel location is excellent , all types of restaurants are walkable including Indian restaurants,  pure vegetarian restaurants.
Small shopping - street shopping are close by.
Hotel buffet breakfast spread  is  very good.
We noticed that if we book directly,  you get good discounts with fringe benefits too.
Though room conditions are good and reasonable, don't expect as shown in online booking websites, really there's a great difference.

So here the hotel delivers all expectations. It’s in the center of Kuta where the party starts. And we had a room with direct view of the beach in a spacious suite. Breakfast was good, plenty of choices to go for. In 5 nights we were not forced to eat the same food because of the variety. The rooftop pool and the gym were in good shape. Overall a good stay with some minor improvement possibilities in the overall shape of the facilities, but that’s not different from a lot of other places in Bali.","The hotel is at a very convenient place and beach is easily accessible. Breakfast is good and staffs are courteous. Moreover staffs are very responsive and helped us with the issues we found in the room. Rooms are quite spacious and comfortable. There is a beverage section at the common area for tea coffee and water can be refilled which we found very convenient.
However entrance the hotel can be improved and we felt there should be someone to greet us once we take the lift from conceirge to the reception.. some places in the corridor we saw water leaking from ac ducts. We observed the name card on the breakfast remained same  from past day even though dishes were different. Pool was small though the view was very good","This was our last stop and hotel in our 10 day trip and what began as a true high in Ubud, ended up with an  underwhelming stay at Kuta Beach.

Ok the location is bang on Kuta, but parking  if you have a car, it is a nightmare on the mega busy road ahead.

The hotel and rooms are clean/decent but dated, if you take a classic room, your view will be the central lobby with a  huge ship and it feels claustrophobic. One night we stayed at the higher floor which had a view to the open and that felt better. I say rooms are dated, because even though I liked the twin basin concept, the drains were so slow. Wash your face and it took minutes for water to drain off, not very pleasant.

I understand the whole eco theme, but not having tea/coffee in the room is a bit ridiculous. Each time you want some, you have to go to the lobby and make yourself a cuppa, which is not convenient.

The buffet breakfast was decent with many western and local choices. I liked the sushi and Indonesian selections on offer. It was nice to hear the local musicians play on the Rindik

Reception staff is where I have a dilemma. In a country which prides itself as friendly and considerate, the folks here felt strictly by book. Eg. We finished registering for room by 130pm but given keys at strictly 2pm, as per policy. Everywhere else the staff at other hotels were so accommodating about early or late checkin/outs within reason. It might seem like a minor thing, but why would I want to visit this hotel again?","Location right across from Kuta beach and about 100 meters from Poppies 2 for shopping. Rooms are average (clean but dated), Staff are exceptional. Upstairs restaurant great to watch sunset and relax. Overall hotel is aging and is a 3 star property at best. If you are a light sleeper traffic and nightclub noise may be an issue. Overall was a good stay.","It is located in front of Kuta beach, so it is easy to go to the beach by walk. Near Hotel, there are a lot of bars and restrant. Hotel employees are kind, but some of the male employees are rude to customers. There are free tea & coffee lounge. The breakfast quality is so good. I totally recommend this hotel. Just avoid male employees."

However very busy and hot outdoor seating. Food was a bit spicy but enjoyed the food 👍

We ordered
☑️Balung Kuah – tender pork knuckle in refreshing broth. Not alot of meat on the bone but a decent amount still.
☑️Babi Guling – this was below expectations. Bowl of shredded pork and pork skin was not crispy at all.
☑️Sate babi – loved the spicy sauce on the outside of the meat but the meat itself was a little dry.
☑️Vegetables – not sure what it is exactly but we got some coconut and green leaf stirfry(?) and was good.

The setting is on the top floor of a multi-purpose leisure building, which I presume has been a nightclub previously. I say that as there was a huge media wall behind a dj that has a light system in sync with the music throughout my pleasurable 2.5hrs there.","Perfect place to hangout. If you come to Bali this place is really recommended for you to chill and having some drinks. They have a happy hours promo from 7pm to 11pm for free flow food and drinks.

The food was good and the pizza is so tasty and lovely. And I also like the spaghetti carbonara. The staff so friendly with the amazing pool view inside the cafe.

Can wait to come here again.","Discovering this place was such a bonus. All you can eat AND drink for 200k! WHAT! Where's the catch? Well, there wasn't one and it was so good, we went back 2 nights in a row. Absolutely delicious food, served with style. Cocktails and beers etc too! Highly recommend the chicken wings and the oysters. Also we were a party of 6, and they run a special where you pay for 5 and 6th pays zero. AND there's more..we were given a token coupon for a free bottle of vodka! Amazing value! It felt like Christmas!"

We enjoyed our room, especially the black out curtains after a long trip. Only down side was that the music by the pool was quite loud the whole day so it wasn’t the most relaxing atmosphere. But we loved the swim-up bar.","Great place. Central to our needs and wants.  Rooms are good the only downfall we had was during the night/bedtime. Every time someone went to the bathroom, the whole room would light up as the dividing walls were frosted windows between bathroom and sleep area.

Upon checking into my room, I discovered bloodstains on the bedsheets. I immediately contacted the front desk and requested fresh sheets. Shockingly, the new sheets also had bloodstains on them. This level of hygiene is utterly unacceptable.

To make matters worse, the room was filthy. There was hair all over the floor, clearly indicating that it hadn't been cleaned properly in who knows how long. The room also had a terrible, sickening smell that made it difficult to stay inside for any length of time.

As if these issues weren't bad enough, the cleaning staff added to the misery. They were making a tremendous amount of noise at 7am, laughing and talking loudly right outside my door. This made it impossible to get any rest.

Overall, my experience at this hotel was horrendous. I would not recommend it to anyone and will certainly never be staying here again.","Thank you so much for the kind hospitality and handling everything so polite. The staff are so helpful and friendly.
The buffet breakfast is tasty.
The hotel is located 100mtr away from Long Kuta Beach.

Only one thing,
We just encountered the ants that keep coming to bed since the hotel is surrounded by plants and the underneath bedsheets are a bit stains otherwise it's great.
Overall It was a very good experience.
😊🙏",It a good option for economical travels. The breakfast menu was a bit limited but the location is very convenient with easy access to scooter rentals and walking distance from market and restaurants and kuta beach. It was soothing to listen to their wooden wind chimes near their garden table.,"Rooms are too small.  Hotel common area is not too clean.. ants can be seen everywhere including over the breakfast. The bathroom in the room is badly designed.  There is practically no lock for it and the temporary door leaks all water into the main room.

Breakfast spread is minimal.  Plates are unclean or rather ancient. Service is as slow as slow can be.

Pool side has no shade. You can fry yourself if you choose to use the poolside bar.

Not worth the money","Stayed in this hotel for 6 nights. Its a good budget hotel with lot of group tourists. Every thing clean and comfortable .
They give you 2 key cards. with 1 always keep your AC on even while going out otherwise AC and refregerator takes too long to cool.
For short distance travel use grab / gojeck and for long travel ( 6 hours/ 10 hours ), ask the hotel travel desk. Their rates are good. no need to find taxi else were.
Electric kettle is provided. If possible bring your own dry milk and tea bags as no dry milk is provided and tea bag provided is not of indian taste.
Electrical sockets work with indian mobile chargers.
extra drinking water can be purchsed from a shop just adjoining the hotel.

breakfast has a variety but no eggs.
it consists Rice, noodles,sauceges,  1 non veg snack, 1 veg snack, bread ( with butter/ jam), Babur, stok, fruits, salad, corn flakes, juice and pan cakes.

Room cleaning is done everyday but your bedsheets, pillow covers and towels are NOT changed during the period of your stay.

So, it might not be the most comfortable place to sit around after you're done eating. But their sambal is the bomb! It's super spicy and tasty. I tried the sea fish this time, the fried kerapu.

The sambal are so good. Spicy but in a good way. If you eat spicy food, this is one of the place. I love it.","The portion is big enough for me.

However, the positives ended there. The elevators, hallways and the room smelled unpleasant and had visible dirt and grime. The room itself was minimalist and the right size for my needs, as well described, but the cleanliness left much to be desired.

Hotel staff were most helpful. Great housekeeping. I really enjoy the great room design for Camper Plus. I love that Cara Cara has  Channel News Asia on their TV. Although the laundry machines were not working, it's really cheap to get it done at Laundromat Suci. 20k IDR for 1 kg (~6 pieces) send your laundry in the morning and collect same day afternoon 5pm.

Beautiful sunsets and interesting sights.,Still the favorite spot you need to visit in bali. Wide white sand area with large scope of sunset is the most attractive thing you found at kuta beach.,"A Disheartening Experience at Kuta Beach

My visit to Kuta Beach was, unfortunately, far from the idyllic beach day one might expect. Surprisingly, this beach has received reviews with more than two stars, which I find baffling considering the multitude of issues I encountered.

Firstly, the overcrowding was unlike anything I’ve seen before - it made famous spots like Waikiki Beach, Muscle Beach, and beaches in Marbella, Greece, and Mallorca seem deserted by comparison. The sheer number of people was overwhelming.

Upon arrival, I was bombarded by numerous vendors aggressively trying to sell various items, rent chairs, and offer food. Navigating through this barrage of sales pitches was a challenge in itself, and it took considerable effort to even reach the sand.

The condition of the beach was deeply concerning. Littered with trash and plastic debris, both on the sand and floating in the water, it stood as a stark reminder of the escalating environmental crisis. This issue desperately needs attention from local authorities.

While the scenic beauty of the beach was undeniable, it was overshadowed by these negative aspects. Most alarming, however, was an incident involving a suspicious individual. As our children played in the sand, a man in his 30s approached and began interacting with them, prompting me to intervene. This encounter was unsettling and raised serious safety concerns.

For families considering a visit, I strongly advise caution or even seeking alternative beach destinations. Kuta Beach, with its current state of overcrowding, environmental neglect, and potential safety risks, is a place I would not recommend for a peaceful or enjoyable family outing.","This beach is always windy and with a big waves. Same day Jimbaran is calm.
For me the best beach in Bali is around Mengangan . Kuta is not my place. Also is very crowded there. Some places at Nusa Dua are also very good.",Plenty of chairs with the makeshift bars all along the beach..Friendly massage ladies pass through the parasols if need to relax even more...Good place for beginners at surfing to learn as waves aren't that high...

The main issue is with the building it self as you go to enter your room is very old and paint is breaking and it needs so much of renovation.

The breakfast was very limited. Would I stay there again. Maybe I think for the price it was ok. But I would recommend paying a bit more and getting something more decent.","Really good for the price. Not everything is perfect but for what we paid we were super happy.
A pool, AC, a good breakfast (fruits, eggs, noodles, toast, etc) and hot water! Hard to find these four things together for this price in SE Asia. Even had a nice balcony.
Only issue is that we were on the side where there is a construction nearby so we got some noise from that, but not bad at all.
