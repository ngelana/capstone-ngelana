ChIJKeZCTb0Y0i0RHnitYiCWjhM,Villa Rimba Ubud,-8.421430599999999,115.29575149999998,"Kedisan, Tegallalang, Gianyar Regency, Bali 80561, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=1409228799252199454,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-5223-2323,,lodging,4.4,52,,"This is a great place to stay for a holiday with friends or alone.
They have various types of rooms,
The ones with a wild green view and the ones with swimming pool views. Both are great. The rooms are clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. It's walking distance from a waterfall and some rice fields to do the tracking.","We booked villa Kama for 3 weeks, as a result we lived here for 4 weeks.
There is a great staff with impeccable service: polite and decent guys.  Our numerous luggage was brought to the villa and taken out to a taxi during check-out, daily cleaning, every repair (water or internet) was resolved very quickly.  the villa itself seems to me to be remembered for the rest of my life: a real jungle!  and there is so much vegetation on the balcony that you can study it every day and discover something new, the eye rejoices at the variety of shades of green.  And taking a bath outside was amazing!
of the minuses: the breakfasts are very monotonous and for three weeks I wanted not only to choose an eggs sunny side up or an omelette, but you have choice not to take breakfast if you extend living there. there were a lot of insects in the room every evening we had an insect cemetery on the floor and this was with daily cleaning.  Anyway for me it was an interesting experience of living in the jungle.  recommend!","Outdoor area is quite nice and seems like on the pictures, with nice views. Can't say the same about indoor area. It was really worn down (especially the kitchen area), cupboards and closet were dirty, AC was not working, mold in a lot of places.
Would expect a lot more for the price.
Staff were very nice though","DO NOT STAY HERE!

SCAM ALERT! Ketut, a permanent manager tried to facilitate a shopkeeper to steal from me. He took me shopping in Tegalalang and when I was distracted he took my bag of clothes back into the shop and told the shopkeeper to take clothing from the bag. I caught them red-handed!

There was no hot water.
The breakfast was terrible with no options except an omelette and bread. No juice. No drinkable water in room. The only dinner option was a very expensive restaraunt. There was no wi-fi.

I believe the wi-fi was switched off so I had no other options for food and taxis except for what Villa Rimba offered. When I complained the wi-fi miraculously appeared.

Avoid this place. Stinks like a scam. I was travelling with my child too so I felt unsafe here.","Very amazing and beautiful villa. I feel like in paradise. Even you stay alone or with family or with friends still you have a quality time without disturbing anyone who stay there, because there's the distance between your room and others. You can request food or cook by your self. There's also many store and local market with low price. The area close to beautiful destination like Tampak Siring Palace, Panglipuran (the cleanest village in the world) waterfall, agricultural terracing, sulfur baths etc."

Can not recommend the butter chicken enough was delicious!

Great price to go with such wonderful food. The view of the rice fields is magnificent. If you go late at night, there's a good chance of seeing fireflies.

Family run business the service is fantastic. I've already been twice, and I'm going back again and again.","While we were returning from the elephant safari by scooter, we decided to go somewhere random to avoid the rain and because we were hungry. By the grace of God, it was Duma Sari Warung restaurant. The food was incredibly delicious and the owners were very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, prepared in a traditional way. The view in front of you is priceless. If you are hungry and want to eat something nice with a view, you should definitely try it. They do everything naturally. I couldn't take pictures of the food because I couldn't stand the look of it and ate it right away, but I took the view :)","Very good food and delicious Watermelon-Smoothie. I had the fried rice and some french fries.
The view over the rice fields is very nice, with two beautiful Lotus flower ponds with fish in them. Lots of chickens and ducks wandering the rice fields, so you're always entertained ðŸ˜‰

I had a little chat with the owner, and he is a very nice guy.

Prices are very reasonable, too.

10/10","What a beautiful find! AMAZING views out over the rice terraces and our food was excellent. I especially loved the tea which had a flavour I have never tasted.

Please don't miss this spot!","Very nice restaurant with good local food, theview must be amazing during the day, unfortunately we came in the evening."
