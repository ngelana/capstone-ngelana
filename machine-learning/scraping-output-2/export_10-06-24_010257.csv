But if it's open for business, signage is not really necessary, because usually there will be a long queue of customers lining up to the side of the road. Apart from the long wait time and queue, the building is spacious. The price of the foods and drinks is really affordable. They serve a horror themed menus, like angel and devil noodles, kuntilanak drink etc.","Same menu as the other Kober.
Couldn't give 5 stars because I wanted to try their waffles (say it on the menu) but they didn't had it. Dimsum was ok. Good hot cappuccino.
But comfortable and nice atmosphere, very big space and garden!","Open, spacious seating. Although there was a short queue the cashier was quick and the food arrived promptly. Finger food. 10K avocado frappe.","Very epic and historical building

The side dish as call fried potatoes and salad had happened, but sorry deepfried potatoes and a green island if chopped salad leaves with a teaspoon of dressing was a minus.
Friendly staff, quick service, clean place. Sorry, good but not extraordinary.","This is incredibly tasty, and the price is affordable. The thick crispy pork belly was delicious! The staff is quite pleasant and helpful however, we assume there are only three people working here, so our food comes late and takes 50 minutes to prepare.","At first, I am a bit hesitate, because I can't find their menu online. But since they serve pork, so why not

I order pork satay with rice & ice tea (Rp 36.000). As for the tea, they gave with sugar (liquid sugar on the tea). So if you want a regular ice tea, i think you should tell them ""without sugar"". Btw they dont have debit card machine, but you can use Qris

They serve the food fast enough, i dont wait that long (approximately 5-10 minutes). They gave the satay with 2 sambal (matah & barbecue). The barbecue is quite spicy, i think its as spicy as ""shihlin barbecue level 3"".

They have an outdoor space as well. One thing that i notice, their bench is a bit shorter than the normal bench.

Maybe next time I'll try their pork ribs (iga bakar - its their signature menu - but it takes 30minutes to be served)","Very quiet when I go there, even the front desk fall a sleep and play phones. You cant even see anybody eating from the outside.

We come a long way, and see no one here .

We decided not to buy..and eat elsewhere.","Overall is good, but incidentally when I stopped by here some of the menus ordered were empty, and there was a little mistake when ordering a drink. Beside the main play area was also broken. But the taste of the food is very satisfying."

Taste is not special","Taste good and different from reguler balinese grilled style (usually using red big chilli based with sweet spicy taste but Pak Made uses kind of butter and garlic based and salty tasted). We ate grilled fish, grilled prawn, fried squid, plecing kangkong for 3 person, and spend IDR 600K (which quite over-priced for me compared to its taste, resto ambiance & services).
1 medium sized fish, 6 prawn, portion of fried squid, 4 drinks, 3 rice, 1 portion vegetable are in the 600K bill.

My suggestion if you are new to this place, better to ask for price since it is not stated in the menu.","I ate at this Warung Ikan Bakar  in the early 90's ... The best slow cooking warung, in the world ... still good until today ...
Suggest you call and order your food before going here, takes some time to cook your order ...","Fish and prawn was perfect
ƒ∞ go there about 9 years,same taste,same family
The price is 3 fish 6 pcs big prawn 3 lemonade(homemade) was 700k (11-03-2023)",Very delicious Grilled Fish and fresh Orange squash. Taste according to price.
