Staff is very kind and provide excellent service. Pool is great and open 24 hours. Breakfast is also nice, just be there on said time or your food will be cold. They provide taxi service ans scooter rental. Overall pretty great!

Electricity went out one night and they didn‚Äôt have any backup which they should have.","A beautiful place to stay! Akusara Jungle is a small, homey place to stay while you visit Nusa Penida. The staff was very helpful with everything we needed, we were able to borrow scooters and later also a driver from the hotel (of course we paid, but the price was desent). The environment of the hotel was beautiful and full of nature. Rooms were clean and sweet, I especially loved the shower that was under a clear sky.","My fiance and I booked 4 nights here and we could not have been happier with our stay. It was a beautiful little villa with the most helpful staff who were incredibly kind. Daily breakfast was fantastic, our entire stay was so peaceful and relaxing.

The only worry we had was location after reading other reviews but we thought the location was ideal. Nice and quiet out of the Main Street, only a few minutes on the bike to get anywhere we needed to go.

Highly recommend staying at Akusara Jungle Resort & Spa","We have nothing complain about.
We really enjoyed our stay here.
The houses are very pretty and you feel right at home with enough room for everything.
Everything was clean when we came and got cleaned really good everyday.
The staff here is super nice and super helpful. They make you feel comfortable right away.
They always had drivers ready when we wanted to go out and we never had to book anything on our own they always helped us with ferries, beachtours or snorkeling trips. When one of us got sick they offered and gave us medicine for her.
The breakfast here is also really delicious and overall the atmosphere here is really soothing and enjoyable.
If you don‚Äôt want to go out you can also stay in an enjoy the pool which is also really nice and clean. You also get a beach towel for that.
We would recommend to stay here for anyone who wants to visit Nusa Penida.","The overall stay was satisfactory. I
enjoyed that the rooms were in individual cabins and that there were just four on the resort which made it feel very personable and quiet‚Ä¶ I definitely managed to disconnect here. You‚Äôre at one with nature so expect to hear geckos throughout the night and the roosters crowing as early as 5am.
However, price vs value for money was simply not good. We paid ‚Ç¨220 for two nights which was pretty overpriced for what we got (especially compared to what we got for the same price in other parts of Indonesia).
The breakfast was basic with not a lot of variety (no juice included, just one dish with a serving of fruit and a hot drink). The resort has ‚Äúspa‚Äù in the title and there was no spa on the resort. As it‚Äôs a bit far from restaurants you must depend on the resort to get back and forth (there is no Gojeck here) so that is 125k return for a 4min drive.
The room was cleaned during the day so we had clean towels but tea and coffee wasn‚Äôt replaced (we had one sachet of coffee for two people for two days).
They offer an island tour for one day (excludes food) and you get to see the entire island for a million rupiah which is a pretty nice deal. Freezing cold water, not a drop of hot water for a shower.
Overall, two days was enough here."

It's really dark and the roads are extremely bumpy, though a little scary, but once you reach the place, it's worth! The staffs welcome you with smiles and patience, they are helpful and thoughtful, kind and nice. They make small talks and have fun and make friends with everyone, make you feel like home no matter where you came from.

Breakfast that came with it was good, the pool is cleaned on a daily basis and because it has only six rooms around, it's really quiet and peaceful.

Note that this is an island, not city area where it's bustling and hustling. The island itself has power outage, so it's recommended to bring a little flashlight or portable fan with you around, but the staff will personally come to your room and apologise to you for something that's not their fault, which was really nice and kind of them and we totally understand.

They're friendly and always on a look out for you when you enter or leave the place, it's like they are always aware of the surroundings and there for you no matter what. The place is not exactly out of the way, but because it's quite deep in it's really peaceful and calming.

We really loved this place, and my father and I look forward to coming back for the next holiday! Thank you so much!","This place has the friendliest service. We enjoyed our 4 night stay. Our room was very clean but I was a bit disappointed with them for not cleaning our room if we didn't ask for it.
We tried almost all the menus at the restaurant. They are all amazing.

(-) the toilet smells when you use the sprayer
(-) difficult to travel when you don't rent a motorcycle
(-) the access to the hotel is among the bamboo and it's very small and dark

(+) I almost can't complain except for those I mentioned earlier.
(+) big and clean pool
(+) quiet environment
(+) amazing food and drinks
(+) excellent staff","Service and staff are very friendly. The location of the hotel is exactly in the nature. The side road used to reach the hotel from the main road was unfortunately broken and the lighting was insufficient. Rooms are newly restored. Bed and furniture are new but wardrobe is missing. You can relax in the calmness of nature in the balcony area in front of the rooms. A hair dryer could also be placed in the rooms. The options offered at breakfast were both local and international, and they were quite adequate and delicious. Parking was sufficient for the motorcycle. Access to the hotel is possible with a 10-minute motorcycle ride from the port. There is a restaurant and a supermarket near the hotel. I can recommend this business when I evaluate it in terms of price and performance.",did not stay in the accommodations but came to watch sports with my friends. This was one of the only bars we could find to watch live sports. you have to walk through a more foresty area which is a little to dark at night. the staff are very kind and they gave us nuts with our beers and they were very tasty.,"We had a wonderful 4 days at TarzanMarriott.
This is a small family run boutique style resort, including a sports bar, pool and open air restaurant. Excellent  food.
Our room was spacious  very clean and comfortable.
Being just off the main road there was no traffic noise, so it is peaceful and quiet, along with the odd rooster.
We were able to arrange a couple of tours with the resort. A clean modern car, a safe driver who had a wealth of local knowledge.
Would definitely go back again."

Comfy beds, aircon and the outdoor shower was beautiful. The rooms are very clean and are traditional Balinese style. Katuk went out of his way to make us feel welcomed and took us out for a day trip to go snorkeling and well as the Angels billabong and broken beach. He drove us down to a local market and had dinner with us. Would definitely recommend this homestay. It‚Äôs a 5 minute walk to the beach as well and set high on the high hill so you get a nice breeze üòÄ",Definetly recommended. Very nice place and accomodation for the price. Staff was very friendly and helpful. One of them told us a perfect route for all the special places on nusa penida. Only the insects in the bathroom made me feel uncomfortable sometimes but I think you have to deal with that everywhere if you live in this kind of jungle.,"Amazing wooden bungalows with seaview. Very clean and beautifully furnished! Really nice owner
If needed, scooters can be rented and transfer from the harbour can be organised","Really nice place to stay, close to a few good spots and it's very quiet."

From the main road it takes you about 5-10 minutes walk, just continue and you will find it.","Great sports bar, great vibe and caring staff - couldn't recommend more highly.

It‚Äôs a little hard to get to and don‚Äôt expect to show up and get to see birds. Best to text beforehand and arrange a morning or afternoon tour.,"A place for rehabilitation and breeding of wild birds that are almost extinct.  This place is located in Village PED Nusa Pemuda Klungkung Bali and was initiated by a group of young people who really love and want to protect and preserve endangered or endangered bird species with a very high awareness of forming this association with very minimal costs.  I would like to ask help, this foundation can be assisted financially to continue the mission and vision of preserving endangered animals.
For birdwatchers and photographers of birds and wildlife, I really appreciated to ask you to visit this place and to give support to this foundation.  We can see and take photos of some rare birds such as the Bali Myna and Bali Sterling birds in this place quite easily.  Come, visit this place and give support to this foundation so that they can continue to breed birds whose existence is very few in number and whose existence is threatened.  Thank you",This place is starling bird sanctuary + other birds. They do bird watching tour at nusa penida. There are varieties of birds in Nusa Penida. Fees applied. Need to arrange with the coordinator,Amazing place to camp and do hiking.  lots of birds.  Very clean.  Very kind and educated staff.,"Top place to volunteer and stay. Volunteering activities includes beach litter clean ups, teaching English in local schools, monitoring the critically endangered Bali Starling, organic gardening.
