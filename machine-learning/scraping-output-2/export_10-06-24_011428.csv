A big and clean area for spending your whole day. Staying here, you don't need to go outside for any other activities.  Food is so delicious,  they have separate resturants for different foods,  Italian restaurants,  sea food, Indonesia food, Japanese etc.
It takes 15 to 20 minutes to the airport in normal traffic.
The garden was so nice to walk under the shadows. The swimming pool was wide enough alongside the restaurant so you can order the food or drinks.","Spacious room, with walk in closet and bath tub. Hotel area is very large, so if you don't want to walk much, request rooms nearer to the central garden. Beyond the main lobby & garden there's a cluster of very nice swimming pools, and beyond that, direct access to public beach. Hotels can't have private beach due to local regulation, but this one is deserted anyway because of it's location. Food was good. Plenty of open  space to relax and enjoy the breeze. Staff are very friendly.

Can't comment on the value since I was on company event.

And, oh, the public toilets have warmed seats. Super nice.","Big beautiful rooms with delicious AC, comfy beds and TVs that chrome cast! Food is nice for resort food, lots of beachfront restos nearby. Beach was absolutely beautiful- tamer waves than other spots, so great for relaxing. Lots of umbrella and beach chaises to lounge on. Love the decor of the pool, and koi fish all around!","The best hotel in Bali. The staff cannot do enough to help. Genuine smiles. The most incredibly relaxing experience. Club Acces is a must, afternoon tean and cocktails and canap√©s. The main pool was closed for renovation during our stay, which made the club pool quite busy, but didn't detract from our enjoyment.","We are having a good time, excellent for families or couples, close driving distance to Airport.

The food is delicious and for the location it‚Äôs bang central to the main road for Uluwatu. We hired a scooter and wizzed around everywhere!

BIG note: the bed is absolutely incredible. We‚Äôve stayed in many hotels but this bed‚Ä¶we struggled to get up in the morning. With the air conditioning and the absolute comfort of the mattress and pillows we were practically bed bound most mornings!","Nothing but 5 stars here. We absolutely loved staying here to end our recent Bali holiday. ü•∞
I would recommend to anyone. Tucked away off the main road. Close to the beach and other activities.","Stayed at Lumbini Villas and Spa, and it was a truly pleasant experience. This isn't just a hotel, but a large area filled with private villas. I stayed in a one-bedroom villa which featured a large bathroom and its own swimming pool. The property also has two communal pools, a children's playground, and an enclosed room with a ping pong table. Occasionally, you can hear the road, especially in the evenings when motorcycles speed by, but it doesn‚Äôt detract from the overall relaxing atmosphere.

The villa offers a great sense of privacy; you can hardly see the neighbors thanks to high fences made of trees and concrete. Inside, it‚Äôs very cozy, and while stepping outside might momentarily break the spell, as it can in many places in Bali, this is quickly remedied with a short motorcycle or taxi ride to wherever you need to go. The location is particularly convenient for those looking to reach various parts of the many areas within about 40 minutes.

Additionally, the pricing is very reasonable, making Lumbini Villas and Spa an excellent value for the quality and privacy offered. This place is highly recommended for anyone seeking a private and comfortable retreat at an affordable price.","Very nice villa in Jimbaran area. The room that we stayed was pretty spacious. One bedroom but enough for couple. The barhroom semi outdoor concept.
The villa has a private pool with 1.2m depth. I stayed in villa no.91 and it‚Äôs clean, AC also working great. I also enjoyed the breakfast that they served.
The floor under the shower needs to be renewed.
The water coming out of the shower is too weak.
The road in front of the villa complex was busy, to many vehicles.","very idyllic. connection is very good to the everyday life of the Balinese. the beach is within walking distance. the rooms/villas are very large and spacious. very stylishly furnished.

Close to Jimbaran beach. Quiet and friendly. Beautiful set up far from big impersonal hotels.,"I decided to return to Bali because of this hotel. From the location to the layout and the services, there is nothing to complain about. It's just over a 20-minute drive from the airport to the hotel. I was overwhelmed by the decoration and interior here. It's truly rare for me to stay in a place where I can't believe I'm in such a really really beautiful hotel.

As for the service, there's no need to mention it. From the front desk  to the housekeeping and the F&B staff, everyone is very kind and cheerful.

Two nights here are not enough for me. If I have the opportunity to return, I will visit the hotel and explore the other rooms. Thank you for these truly worthy experiences.","Rated 5 stars but real feel almost 4.
We stayed 4 nights - in 2 superior rooms - 10 and 11.
Pros and cons:
++ garden, some vintage decoration
+ restaurant area, breakfast. Breakfast is alla cart - you could choose 1 dish out 5 sweets - 5 sawory - coffee, tea, natural juices. They are tasteful and nice served.
+ mattress - confy
+ pool area - 3 pools - with shadow and very good sunbeds.
- lots of musquitos - they provide solutions to combat them but not enough.
- - - rooms dark, lack of amenities (garbage can in the room, TV weird position, wifi working very slow), toilet water lickings, no privacy, 2 m balcony, nowhere to dry towels/swimming suits, not well isolated, pillows low quality - it's a barn transformed in a room with some nice vintage elements - but not practical at all.
-- location - 15 min walking to the closest beach - and it's not the best one in the town (lack of sunbeds, to many locals, no quality beach bar); there are 2-3 good restaurants in the area and no point of interest; closest one by grab / taxi it's around 15 min - depending on trafic;
-- hospitality and services are sub standard for Bali - you have to book everything with 24 h in advance (shuttle to the beach, yoga lessons etc). They are understaffed - maybe 8-10 persons to cover around 20 rooms.
+ cleaning service in the room it's very fast and good.
-  breakfast and restaurant waiting time is rather high - 10-20 minutes depending on the day."

Walking through the lobby just to get to the restaurant was beautiful itself, but the whole dinner experience was beyond our expectations. We got seated with a beach view (which we got to see fireworks across the beach later in the night), got complimentary peanuts & prawn chips, and had a live band playing that set the atmosphere to be top notch.

However, you will have to wait for quite a while before someone takes your order and sent them to your table. A lack of staff maybe.","Lovely spot to spend the afternoon and watch the sunset.

We had Beef Rendang and Nasi Goreng Chicken with peanut sauce. Both were equally divine.

For dessert, we had the Balinese pancake, which was an amazing mix of local flavors.

Besides the food, the setting is also super pretty, very spacious, and has a retro design.

Nice place for romantic dinner with beautiful sunset.
A lot of seafood restaurant and cafes.
Also pick a restaurant which has umbrellas up till the sun sets as it's pretty hot.

Tip: Grilled seafood is very popular in all the restaurants there. Just make sure you choose the right package, if you want to stay within your budget.
With lobsters and crabs, an average dinner costs around $200-$300 depending on the weight.
Don't forget the squid, they are best and so fresh when grilled.

Although near the airport, you never hear the planes. Paradise!!

Not recommended for small budget visitors, since its not an easy task to get cheap meal.

Even though normally they don't take cash payments. So lazy to contact Booking.com and confirm. Totally unprofessional. Didn't even give me a proper invoice. Stay away from people like these. The staff on site is nice though.","You can‚Äôt beat the value for money here! Location excellent! Make sure you go and check out the seafood sunset deals at the cheaper end of the beach! Also amazing value. This place is all new- cool aircon and clean.. and remember it‚Äôs budget so don‚Äôt expect slippers and robes. Was surprised they offered a dental kit! Take mosquito repellant, there are some in the area",Great location and huge bed!,"Clean and comfy, very cheap price.. I suggest take room on second floor.. Thank me later.."

and the meals were bad.,very disappointed.
may be on pic looks ok, but it isn‚Äôt.
Jelly belly pork, asian signature dish, was very , extremely dry. probably the prepped a few days ago and just refresh it. the same with duck.
seafood quite ok. Pizza is disaster.
we were waiting 25 min before there serve all dishes at the same time, so probably they prep pizza and it was waiting other dishes. when they served it was slightly warm and not good.
i think it quite shame for Intercontinental.
ps. when we back to lobby to get taxi, uou went trough the bridge with souvenirs. i checked one bowl(plate) that i liked in my hotel (ayana resort) and the price was 3 times extra. 250 k vs 74k in my hotel. deceivers","A very underrated hotel. We love everything from the ambience, the friendliness, the food, the room.

Super fresh grilled seafood in front of the pool side bar ‚Ä¶ looking at the ocean. Super super nice place. Lovely precious romantic with an excellent service. Beautiful!,"Excellent service and food. There's a variety of Indonesian, other Asian and international food options. Kids meals come in a cute Bento Box - a very pretty presentation and it also includes some healthy options (eg fruit).
The ambiance is casual, yet refined - perfect for a relaxed meal in a beautiful environment.",Breakfast buffet is a bit pricey but good. Coffee and OJ (freshly squeezed) were excellent. A good selection of food for breakfast including some vegetarian options. Cost is 250k ++ but the hotel is running a 20% off food special right now so 242k. You can sit by the pool/bar area or by the food stations. All open air.

The steak sauce is different from the others.  The meat is very tender with the doneness I want.  thank you for the birthday cake.,"Ate here the last night of my honey moon. Absolutely amazing. Or server, Yunda, did an amazing job throughout our meal. The kitchen service was perfectly paced between courses and every single dish was amazing.

Great atmosphere and service. Best restaurant  at the intercontinental.

This was the highlight of our honeymoon. Thank you so much.","Wonderful Italian cuisine with delectable menus, super nice staff and beautiful settings. They have kids menu and seat with cutlery. Every menu we order was impressive. The amount was tiny though. But worth a visit if you look for a place quite private and upscale with flawless service.
Recommended menus: vitello tonnato, lamb steak and chocolate lava cake.","A Fantastic experience !!

Very recommended ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞.","The restaurant is one of the best one I have enjoyed in Bali.
I attend an awesome show which makes my dinner more tasty.

The waiter is so friendly and catering. They always answer your questions with smile.

Of course the food is authentic. They provide some western foods as well as grilled seafood. I order a local cuisine and it is worth to try.

Anyway, I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you stay nearby","We tried grilled prawns and tuna, and carrot&pumpkin soup. All were good. Everybody is happy.","The seafood fried rice and juice drinks were good.

The pizza taste is good but the crust is like a dry pita.

All the fried items had an old oil taste.

They have an air conditioned indoor area and also outdoor shaded seating.","Lobster was very fresh, the kind that doesn't have brains in the head, just meat. A lot of it. The price is 450.000 for half a kilo. If i have time, will it here again."

The chef put on an excellent performance without being overbearing. Highly recommend the tuna tataki!","It‚Äôs a very special fine dining experience, the chefs are great, making quality steaks and other amazing food, all while being very entertaining. The staff is very kind and attentive. The prices are somewhat higher than local restaurants but it is definitely worth every penny. If you like quality Japanese food I would highly recommend you treat yourself with this experience!","Great Entertainment with good quality teppanyaki (as well as other a la carte dishes), non-stop chorus of teppanyaki-skill showmanship‚Äô around the counters.   Simple condiments of garlic, soy sauce, wine and butter is all the chef needs to transform each ingredient to a delicacy, and extra umami was added with their fun interaction with guests.
Overall attentive service by the staff also complemented the dining experience.
The only negative point is the air-conditioning seems a bit faulty, and we were sweating through our shirts while chomping down freshly ‚Äúyaki-ed‚Äù piping hot dishes, which did diminish the enjoyment. Something for the hotel to look into.","Enjoyable and entertaining.
The kids loved it.
Hefty price considering the many options in Bali ...but a premium product.","Went for dinner during our vacation. Nice setting and staff were friendly and accommodating. However, food was terrible. We had the teppanyaki set and everything tasted very off. To top it off, my wife and I developed diarrhoea the very next morning, which we highly suspect is due to the food we were served here. Lots of potential but they need to sort out their food."

the sambal was so spicy"
