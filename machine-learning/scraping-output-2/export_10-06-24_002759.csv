The area is peaceful, quiet and picturesque. The villa is beautiful, well maintained and comfortable. It was the perfect place to stay for a week! (Word to the wise though: bring a scooter or three - it is remote.)",Balian Hill Villa is one one the most magical places I’ve been to in Bali. The villa is spacious and beautiful. The surrounding is so peaceful and lush. The property is breathtaking - lots of beautiful flowers and plants. You’ll have the most stunning ocean view from the living room and pool. The beach is only a 10 minute ride away and there are plenty excellent warungs for lunch and dinner if you don’t feel like cooking in the villa. I highly recommend staying at Balian Hill Villa!,,,
