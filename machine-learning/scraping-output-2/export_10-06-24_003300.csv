It was a beautiful spot, and our guide was truly lovely. We had samples of everything and found it so interesting. My 10 year old daughter loved it too. It is expensive to buy things at the end but reflects the quality of their products and the time put into producing them. Highly recommend!","LOVE IT SO MUCH! best experience! the staff really great when explaining. the price also worth it. for the input, maybe give mineral water with the tester. I don't mind if need to pay. overall it's really great!","The journey here from Nusa Dua was totally worth it, our lovely guide welcomed us and took us through all the amazing set of various flavoured tea and tasting honey from stingless bees that just look like household flies: Ps they have 40% spirit and 18% rum apparently derived from traditional distillation...yummyyy","Great experience if you are in the area and you like coffee, tea or honey. Free tasting of their local coffees, their big range of teas (Mangosteen peel YUM!) and their 2 honeys, including the very different but delicious sweet & sour honey from Balinese black tiny bees. The staff were delightful and very knowledgeable and they show you around their plants and bees. You can buy something at the shop in the end but there is no pressure from them.","We stopped by at HoneyBee Farm & Luwak Coffee during our stay at Candidasa. It was a very nice experience, our guide explained everything about the coffee and honey process, and then we tried some complimentary teas and coffees and a cup of Luwak coffee (50,000 IDR). After the visit, we passed by the shop where we bought some tea and coffee to bring home. I would totally recommend it!"
