Bali Tourism Polytechniques (Politeknik Pariwisata Bali) is just nexdoor. If you wanna stay a little longer in Bali with affordable price then this is the place that might suit you. It is not too far from the outstanding GWK statue and you can even see it from the distance from this place.,"Small room and very humid, damp...especially on the first floor. Leave your leather stuff for one day in this room and it will get moldy. Unstable internet connection. Unsafe - a thief stole my belongings here and there was nothing they can do.

It's only nice from the outside.","Affordable, Cozy, Easy Access, Employee have a GREAT manner, and if you are come to bali and wanted to visit every place near south kuta this place one of my favourite",It's a nice and cozy homestay. Nice rooftop with quite a view

The building is what makes this place special, very photogenic. The food could have been better, however I haven't gotten the chance to try one of their signature dishes yet.","My recent dining experience at Madawa Restaurant was nothing short of exceptional, marked by an exquisite blend of professional service and experience.

Staff Professionalism and Friendliness: The staff at Madawa struck a perfect balance between professionalism and warmth. Their attentive and friendly service created a welcoming atmosphere that added to the overall dining experience.

Quality of Service: The service was impeccable. From the moment we entered until our departure, every need was anticipated and met with efficiency and a smile. The staff's knowledge about the menu and their recommendations were particularly commendable.

Culinary Excellence: The quality of the dishes served at Madawa was a true highlight. Each dish was a testament to the chef's expertise, presenting a delightful array of flavors and textures. The presentation was as impressive as the taste, making each course a culinary delight.

Madawa Restaurant offers an outstanding dining experience where the quality of service matches the excellence of its cuisine. The staff‚Äôs dedication to ensuring a memorable meal is evident in every interaction. I highly recommend Madawa Restaurant to anyone seeking a dining experience that combines exceptional food with top-notch service of western and traditional local delights.","Stayed at taman dharmawangsa villas for 5 nights. 4 of the days I just wanted to hole up and relax at the resort so I could just chill. Had lunch and dinner ever day at madawa and it was awesome. Service is great,
Cocktails super delicious, food was delicious and presentation was excellent. Restaurant was pretty busy at breakfast for the buffet (also excellent) but for some reason it‚Äôs really quiet during lunch and dinner. Which is such a shame because the restaurant is fantastic and the ambiance is just lively with piano music playing and an absolutely beautifully designed restaurant. If you‚Äôre staying at TD or staying nearby honestly I could not recommend you staying in and trying the hotel restaurant more.","love this place so much! everything was perfect, nice food and excellent service, highly recommendedü•∞","It was amazing lunch here.
