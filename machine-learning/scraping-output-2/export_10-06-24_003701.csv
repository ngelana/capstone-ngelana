The path is pretty flat throughout and should be easy enough for most people with reasonable fitness! It runs past beautiful temples, rivers and gives epic views of the valley.

Make sure you keep walking along the road once the path is finished as you'll be treated to lovely rice fields and a semi quiet road. The highlight was grabbing a smoothie at the Kastara hotel bar with epic views of the valley.","AWESOME WALK IN NATURE. If you're expecting views of large rice paddies, then this isn't for you. But you start by crossing a bridge with great photo opportunities of the river, then a temple. The walk climbs with a few steps, for a few ks and you'll be amongst trees until you reach a temple gate. There's a swing and drink stop just past the start, and a village to explore at the end, including chatting with local artists and their original works. I loved it and there are rice paddies past the gate but small ones. Enjoy your walk üòä","Pretty 20 minute walk. For the most part it's quite overgrown and views are limited, so it's more of a nice stroll than a tourist attraction - I was expecting something a little different given the amount of blogs recommending to do this. We went at 7.30ish, route was fairly quiet and peaceful. We were lucky to see a monkey by the temple as well. We'd already walked the Sweet Orange Trail as well, and the views of the rice fields on that were so beautiful - highly recommend!","Want to try a walking trail and so we chose Campuhan trail as our driver said there was easy parking over the sweet orange trail.

Trail starts with some stairs and it gets quite steep initially. There is a river that runs through it, plus a nice temple.

The trail goes upward and you can see that it is well paved with long grass on each side.
Go early as the sun gets rather intense.

Not so much of a view though at the end you will see houses and small padi fields. It was ok for me and I guess I will try out the others next round.","Generally considered an easy route, it takes an average of 1 h 2 min to complete. This is a very popular area for hiking, running, and walking, so you'll likely encounter other people while exploring. The trail is open year-round and is beautiful to visit anytime.

Overall, the Campuhan Ridge Walk is a must-visit attraction for anyone visiting Ubud. The stunning views and peaceful surroundings make it a perfect escape from the busy city, and it is a great way to immerse oneself in Bali's natural beauty."

Zest is a must-visit for anyone seeking a tranquil setting and exceptional vegan cuisine in Ubud.","I was excited to visit Zest, a beautifully decorated vegan restaurant I kept seeing on social media. However, it was very loud due to traffic noise, the ventilation system, and live music. I had planned to work there, but left as soon as I finished eating. While I appreciate the all-vegan menu, the chickpea omelette I ordered was nothing special and not very filling. The decor is beautiful and the staff is nice. I have mixed feelings about my visit. I don't think I'll go back unless its for an event given that there some other great vegan restaurants in Ubud.","Absolutely incredible. I‚Äôm a passionate meat eater who‚Äôs not easy to impress with vegan dishes, but this‚Ä¶ this was out of this world. We ordered the BBQ cauliflower wings, mini burger sliders, empanadas and mushroom tempura sushi - all of which were top notch. Order this exact set for a party of 2 and you will thank me later ;)

Prices are also very fair considering the quality of the food and the high end decor. A must visit when in Ubud!","Love everything about this place. Great foods, lovely ambience, stunning views, good services, clean restrooms. Superb! You'll find the different scale of plant based menus here. And all tasty. A bucked list when you visit Ubud. Quite pricey though.","Outstanding view and I would say a must-visit if you are in the region. The smoothie bowl was very delicious albeit a fairly small portion compared to the regular size across the island.

I also had a green tea matcha, which was delicious but not sweet.

They had live music playing, which was a pleasant little extra.

The service is good.

I would advise to make a reservation/booking ahead of time as it was fully packed when I was there."

We even enjoyed it so much that we returned twice for a hearty yet vegan lunch (even though we're not even vegan or vegetarian).

We went for the a salad from their salad bar which was so delicious and the ingredients were very fresh. We liked it so much that we ordered this salad on both of our lunch visits.
As a second dish, on the first time we ordered the green waffle which had kind of a weird stretchy texture and we didn't like it so much. On the second visit, we went for the one of the items from their specials menu - green vegetables curry which was so delicate, delicious and a very special dish.

For drinks we ordered their cold pressed juices - we tried the juicy fruit and the classic green which were both very refreshing and fresh.

Like in their Uluwatu branch, they have a beautiful store, where they sell fresh & special produce.","I must admit, the atmosphere here is lovely, and the people are incredibly nice and kind.

I was here for the first time and overall, my experience was more positive than negative.

Pros:
- The staff seated me on a couch due to my constant lower back pain, which I appreciated for the comfort.
- Cool interior design.
- The coffee was decent, though the latte was stronger and initially more acidic than I would've liked, until the ice melted.
- Discovering it was a vegetarian cafe upon receiving the menu turned out to be a pleasant surprise, as I was looking to eat healthier that morning.
- I ordered a latte + croissant, a brunch plate, and extra caramelized onions. It was a sizable portion, and I was quite full.
- I enjoyed the plate, despite the slight inconvenience of eating from small bowls. It felt like a unique Balinese take on a Turkish breakfast, which I liked.

Cons:
- The staff, while not overbearing, didn't check in on me. I ended up moving a pile of dirty dishes to another table myself.
- The ceiling looked as if it belonged to an abandoned building, complete with spiderwebs and pieces of bamboo thatch that seemed like they might fall on your head or into your plate at any moment.
- It's best to eat the croissant as soon as it's served. They warm it up, and once it cools down, it starts to taste ""stale.""

Please fix the roof, it‚Äôs creepy","A wow place for lip smacking vegetarian food near campuhan ridge walk , at the entry they have a wash basin to wash your hands before you get seated which I really liked , it‚Äôs a good spacious dining area on first floor. Talking about their food .. hands down it‚Äôs one of the most memorable and delicious meals I had in Bali. Their food has the kick . Almost every revue on google had talked about tapas which made us order it too and boy it definitely lived up to the heights ‚Ä¶. The quesadilla was just too good as well . Would love to be back someday.",The photos looks real cool but actual atmosphere you must discount about 15% off. Be prepare to love the heat as there ain't any aircon in this cafe. It's still up to individual preference though. But I must say this place feels rustic and service was pretty good with nice drinks and food.,"It's the best omelette I have had in Bali. Great sweet potato sourdough, too. Perfect view overlooking a temple.

Nice interior and music playing. Spacious.","This place is so cute! It's very unassuming from the outside but there is a lot of cozy seating. No air conditioning (AC) though so probably wouldn't be the best place to work. If you love the sunlight but want to be indoors, it's great. I didn't try the food, so I can't say how it is, but I ordered the immunitea with less honey and it was good."

The atmosphere is very nice, there is a nice view from the terrace of the restaurant. Plus, the staff are super friendly, and we had some nice short conversations with them which was so pleasant.
I can only nitpick about the smoothies, which were so so. Other than that, we had a superb experience.","Beautiful hidden plant based gem as you go through the entrance of Antonio Blanco museum which gave an authentic unique feel to it.... going upstairs to their outdoor venue and checking out their indoor space - both are equally beautiful, relaxing and elegant.

I had the oyster mushroom sushi rolls and particularly loved sampling my friend's lasagna with pesto (fantastic basil pesto!!) as well as the pumpkin gnocchi. Portions are extremely generous and staff are impeccable and super friendly.

Lovely hideaway in busy Jalan Raya and nearby restaurants that can get overwhelmingly packed.

Can't wait to return to Plant Bistro - thank you for feeding us health and happiness!","The food there is pure paradise ü•∞ created with so much love :) you can feel it with every bite!

The location of the bistro is fantastic and modern, situated high up, offering incredible views. Finding so many delicious and varied plant-based dishes is a big plus. The staff were excellent and very friendly. The food was incredibly tasty. Definitely a must-try place in Ubud.","Chanced upon Plant Bistro with recommendations from the hotel reception. Not a big fan of vegan food but this this changed my mind and awe me! The food is one of the best tasting food that we had in Bali. We ordered the pepperoni pizza and some charcoal pasta. It tastes sooo good. The juices are good too, No ""side effect"" which we were very concerned in Bali as my wife is pregnant.

The dessert are awesome. Michelin level I would think for the choc orange cake. The ice cream normal if you don't have enough calories to spare.

And what made the whole experience amazing was a very nice and friendly conversation with a friendly, beautiful staff call *Yesa*, who took the courage to converse with us to find out how is our food and stay in Bali. Very pleasant and heartwarming conversation. A lady with great potential. Hope the restaurant treasure and groom her. :)

Overall, me and my wife enjoyed this place.

By the way, they have both indoor and outdoor seating. Don't be shy to request for a change from outdoor to indoor halfway through your meal if gets too warm outside. :)

Oh! By the way, to go to the restaurant, you need to go up a steep slope. About 50m walk."

Loved staying here. Thanks to the kind staff, especially Gusti, Wayan & the executive chef.

Generous views of lush nature from every part of the hotel and a shady pool area to lounge by (as well as another pool on the other side). The rooms were comfortable with effective air conditioning & fans, a priority for me. Some of the rooms are damp but it's to be expected in this climate and jungle environment.

They're renovating soon and I look forward to returning again. An incredible experience given the price. Thanks Tjampuhan.","I've stayed at the Tjampuhan a number of times on my stay in Bali, because it's a beautiful resort to relax in :) I absolutely love the spa area they have with hot / cold mineral spas. The resort has a very cultural traditional feel and its only 1km from the centre.  The pools are also amazing! The rooms are a little old style but part of the character of the resort.","I had big hopes for this hotel but unfortunately I have to agree with all of the negative opinions. THE VIEWS and surroundings definitely deserve a star but rooms are really really bad. Dark, mouldy and smelly‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve been to 3 different rooms and none of them was satisfying but had to chose one eventually. First one had really strong smell of mould we couldn‚Äôt stand it. Second was very dark and depressive with big gaps in the door so any insects, lizards can go in. It was so uncomfortable I really wished to be home or go somewhere else. Last one was ok, brighter and no air con smell but this one was closer to the road so a bit noisy. We stayed there 5 nights and they didn‚Äôt even change the sheets! The cleaning definitely needs improving too! It‚Äôs such a shame because hotel is absolutely beautiful and deserves a credit for its history but they urgently need to update the rooms.","Tjampuhan hotel was built up around the original home of Walter Spies, the German painter & composer who settled in Ubud in the 1920's, overlooking the Tjampuhan River basin. His beautiful teakwood  house is still rented as the premier facility of the hotel. The other rooms have been built up along the slope of the valley, with eye-popping views of the river and the forest and temples  beyond. The hotel is outfitted with an amazing collection of traditional Balinese artwork -- paintings, sculptures, and carvings, most of which are true antiques.

The breakfast buffet is second to none, with Indonesian and Western options available, including all varieties of fresh tropical fruit.

Be advised that this is not a modern 5-star resort, so some of the plumbing and electrical fixtures are dated. But if you  are looking for an immersion in the natural beauty and cultural splendor of Bali, this is the place for you.","Beautiful views from room, restaurant and reception!
Was welcomed with a cool tea, room was cleaned daily, privacy respected when we didn't need it reset.
Got jetstar holidays package so had a wonderful free buffet style breakfast. Our door locked by Padlock but was different for friends depending where you are in the hotel
Served drinks and food by the poolside.
Very friendly staff.
Downside, pools has inappropriate monkey statues carved into the wall and the place is situated on a hill so it's all stairs. Not accessible at all! Do not recommend for anyone who struggles with stairs!"

It's an open restaurant (no a/c), but the wind and fans make up for it. The mosquitoes may disturb a lot.üôÉ

Despite that, we'll certainly visit again. That's how good the food and drinks are. üòãüëå","I came to Cantina rooftop alone, as a solo traveler, sat and enjoyed a BEAUTIFUL DELICIOUS MEAL! the stuff squid was unbelievably delicious and the desert had me on the verge of ordering another slice. The vibes are super mellow and comfortable to relax with friends, family, even for a date or on your own. The view was breath taking. My waitress recommended some great dishes and was super helpful and friendly. 10/10 experience ! :) I will be back!","Unexpectedly satisfying. Love the vibes and foods. Price quite descent for the portion and quality. If you looking for good steak, try here.","I had the most incredible meal in Cantina Rooftop. Started with Oka, Polynesian Ceviche, market fish, coconut milk, cucumber, plantain chips, then dove into Jerk chicken as main course. It's a Green plantain patacones, citrus yoghurt, lime. As a side, i order Egg Fried Rice was smoky perfection. Topped it all off with a refreshing gingerito to cool things down. Def come back again for another menu!"

Beautiful new property, with superbly welcoming & attentive staff. Clean rooms, very comfortable beds and pillows. Amazing pool & spa area next to its main dining restaurant, both enclosed by the hotel building. Its other restaurant called Clover Cafe facing the street is also nice. Walls are thin, be prepared with earplugs; this did not cause any issues in relaxing for us though, we slept very well.","I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It‚Äôs modern in facilities but traditional in design. Great rooms, swimming pool and restaurant! However what really makes this hotel stand out is their lovely staff. They really go out of their way to make your stay as perfect as it can be!

One suggestion for improvement would be to have a more frequent shuttle bus service to downtown Ubud as it is at least a 30 min walk otherwise.

Overall, a lovely hotel! Would happily stay here again :)","My friends and I had three nights stay at The Have Ubud A Pramana Experience. We loved it. It is a beautiful hotel to rest and relax. Not only are the rooms super beautiful and well maintained, the staff are exceptional. Septi remembered all our names from day 1 and we had a number of recommendations provided to us by Arie who was our airport transfer. We all loved this part of our trip and would stay again.",Great personal service from the beginning till the end. Rooms are new and clean and the resort is has a really nice vibe. They offer daily activities including a morning walk with our guide Krishna which we really enjoyed. The hotel is also very central and near to main shopping / restaurants & bars.,By far the best stay we had in Bali! My partner and I were here for 3 nights and we had such a comfortable stay. The staffs were all so friendly and attended to all of our requests. We felt very welcomed and everything was clean. Housekeeping was very thorough and everything was replaced whenever we requested for clean up service. Location was near the central yet quiet which we appreciated.

Service was quick and super friendly!
10/10 would recommend and return!","We just arrived to Ubud and this was the first restaurant we visited. The restaurant is mint, clean and the staff is attentive. The route there is very scenic too. I had chicken satay and tender bbq pork ribs, then I sent down the most amazing cheese cake with strawberry sauce. I flushed it down with two large bottles of ice cold Bintang. Needless to say I couldn‚Äôt breathe after this bacchanalia üòÖ My fianc√© had a huge vegetarian burger, she couldn‚Äôt finish it.
Hats off to the ladies that run the shop.","I wanted to experience this popular place today, especially since I was craving local food. The fact that it was raining added a special beauty to the ambiance. I ordered two different dishes to experience different tastes and they were both very nice. If you want to experience local food, I definitely recommend this place. The interior ambiance is also very stylish and transportation to this place is very easy.","This legendary warung never disappoints. The food always consistent and their famous bebek betutu is one of the best in town‚Ä¶. Cooked with special Balinese herbs in long hours to perfection. Their marinated pork sate also superb.

Stayed 7 days and it was so amazing! Ubud is insanely nice the walks in sunset trough the ricefields next to the hostels was my favourite. The beds, rooms are really good. Everything is really clean! Breakfast is delicious and the staff is insanely nice! I really appreciated all the work and the team! See you next time","Don‚Äôt book your Mount Batur Trip there. Its the only Hostel in Ubud which will charge you 400.000 RP instead of 350.000. rather book it 3 houses further up the road at the Titiari shop - the lady there is super kind.
After my Trip I arrived 9 minutes to late for breakfast. The Staff told me ‚Äûsorry the kitchen is already cleaned‚Äú - then i noticed some other people still ordered and then they said its only for the people who did the Hiking Trip with us. WHY THEY GONA LIE?  Because of 9 minutes‚Ä¶
Also this place is verry Noisy. The Local children who are living there will scream till 12 pm and the barking dogs (which are many around) will wake up up at 06:00 am - so either there is no way to have a good sleep.
Also the bathroom is super smelly- but it was clean. Guess they have problems with the sewer.
The drinking Water in the room was every morning empty when i woke up. When u ask them to change the big bottle they will tell you ‚Äûlater‚Äú and change it 2 hours later - as they said.
In total the stuff was very unfriendly from the beginning.
Even if its a nice location and a nice place the people who work here are awful.","The hostel is in a great location. However I found the aircon in the africa room way to weak. It felt very hot. So I asked them to turn it up higher but they couldn't (I think it was kinda broken). Instead they moved me to a different bed for my second night closer to the ac. Unfortunately this didn't change anything so I had to change accommodation. Furthermore they had put me in a 22 bed room although I had booked the one with 18 beds. I would've been fine with it if they had told me but they just did it without asking. I only found out by counting the beds because it seemed like there were more.

What I did like was that they kinda did try to make the situation better although it was futile in the end. Also they offer complimentary breakfast  (though almost every hostel here has that).","We went there with my friend because we volunteered in a dog shelter with no accomodations 2 days a week in Ubud so we travelled in Bali and around and then came back each time in this hostel when it wasn't fully booked. We always got there for the service, sense of hospitality, smile, the amazing breakfasts, the comfort of the beds and the chill area upstairs but especially for the people there. We thank Jerry (the owner), Wira and the whole staff for their continuous effort all day and all night, they know how to take care of people and they always have an active listening to our issues when we had some and always try to find the best solution that will suit you. If we're back in Ubud we will definitely come back in WW Backpackers. You guys/girls can go there with your eyes closed ! I count on you Jerry to say hello to Wawa, Wewe and Wiwi for me :)","A large room with 22 beds, smelled sweat and I heard people caughing the whole night. Unfresh dogs were living there, one with only 3 legs. The location was good and it was cheap but I could not stay there for longer than one night."

The comfort and decoration of the rooms, the pool, the lush hotel grounds, the delicious breakfast with fresh juices and the lovely, friendly staff made our stay truly enjoyable. The quality of the spa treatments was exceptional, I felt so light and completely rejuvenated after the Kusuma massage. A big thank you to the entire hotel team for your warm hospitality and our heartfelt best wishes to all of you!","Overall was OK. Rooms and outdoor bath was very aligned with the atmosphere of Bali but the hotel locates up in the hill and you need to walk up for 5-7 mins without sidewalk which makes the road dangerous especially when it gets dark. Breakfast is a-la-carte and you ended up the same thing everyday if you have a long stay. There is no view of the jungle which can be a nice advantage to stay in Ubud. Therefore, I would not prefer to stay again compared to other options in Ubud.","I stayed for 6 days initially I wanted to cancel after checking in because it was not close to Ubud center. However I decided bro stay instead, the staff was professional and friendly. Our rooms were serviced early in the morning (when we went for breakfast and came back it was serviced).The property is clean and quiet if you are a lover of nature then it's definitely for you.

We loved being able to meet lots of great people around the pool and felt very comfortable for the entire stay.","I stayed 2 nights in a private and 3 nights in a dorm and I would say that the dorm downstairs was way superior to the private. The dorm was a lot nicer and cleaner and the air con worked vs the private is in an older building so the air, water pressure and lighting was weak. The staff was very kind and breakfast was perfect for me. A quiet easy going hostel but I do wish there was a little kitchen/fridge and maybe some sort of cultural or social activity.","Although the outside looked nice, the inside of the hostel was pretty average. The bathrooms were seriously old and gross, and the staff was just okay‚Äînothing too friendly. It's a bummer because it seemed like it could be cool, but it ended up being a bit of a letdown with the outdated vibes and not-so-great service. Breakfast is also pretty low average."
