But the problem is i think in the old pool, I was swimming in the pool and i got nicked (i think their tiles are old, so they are very sharp), and i asked the reception for betadine cause their pool injured me but they told me to get it in the reception which was far from my room. what if someone injured badly and all they told you to is ""pls get it in the reception"". So yeah they should increase their safety response + fix those tiles.","Good clean room, the room is bigger than the pictures. Very close to the sanur harbour as well, but you should aware the traffic, it took about 40mins when we travelled to the harbour that day, it shows on google maps only 10mins by less traffic. You need to plan a early leave if you want to catch the boat",Parking is too limited. Suggest that the lobby be airconditioned so new guests are comfortable and more impressed with the hotel's facilities. Also should have more selections for bread toppings.

I was checking this place on gmaps and read through the review, how can people complains about the humble and traditional ambience/environment saying its dirty etc. Like come on, have a common sense? The space is outdoor with authentic balinese concept. There are many other restaurants that serves modernity if you may please. Also when i came in, the chickens are lovely and some were inside the cage nothing chaotic happening.

Super knowledgeable, supportive and inspiring. Also a great place to meet other visiting gamelan aficionados. I try and visit every time I'm in Bali. Highly recommended :-)","My wife and I booked a private workshop with Vaughan and Purnama during our recent trip to Bali. It was a really wonderful expericne. Vaughan began with a fascinating talk on the variety of gamelan  music and on the instruments we were about to try, which he and Purnama demonstrated for us. Purnama then invited us to select instruments we would like to try playing, and introduced us to some basic techniques and building blocks of gamelan music. We were a little nervous at first, as neither of us had any previous experience of playing gamalen and knew very little about it, but Purnama was such a patient and generous teacher that he had us producing some sonorous sounds before long. I would highly recommend this workshop for anyone interested in Balinese culture, musicians or non-musicians.","An excellent institution offering lessons on Balinese gamelan and dance in Sanur. I participated in a private all-day workshop (booked and paid for swiftly and safely via e-mail from abroad before arriving in Bali). The workshop was split into two sessions: a morning session providing general background on the types of Balinese gamelan and evolution of the ensemble throughout history, which was very informative and accompanied by live demonstrations of the instruments by a local staff member, Purnama. Every question I had throughout the presentation was answered thoughtfully by founder Vaughan (via Zoom call, as he was abroad at the time). I think this sort of insight into the instruments and musical genre is just as important as the actual playing techniques.

The second session was a practical session run by Purnama where I was given free rein to try and be guided on any number of instruments they had set out. Honestly a great and fun experience for any musician and the ability to find an instrument whose sound suits you and that you'd like to learn more on will appeal to a general audience as well. The instruction was clear and supportive for doing the sampler and we were able to put together some simple phrases on the instrument I chose by the end of the session.

I suppose if there were anything to note, it was a bit far from me in Ubud and tucked away from the main road so it can be hard to find, but this ensures a quiet environment (save for the music you will be making, of course). When I got dropped off, the driver had mentioned that there were so many good classes in Ubud for gamelan and that this one was quite far, but I don't imagine they go as in-depth as Mekhar Bhuana. If you are interested in a deeper understanding of this key part of Balinese culture, I'd say the trip from anywhere is worth it. I'll certainly be back next time I'm in Bali.

Thanks, MB!","I have hear some gamelan music before and fell in love with the beautiful percussion sounds.   It is a relief from mainstream pop music.  I highly recommend taking a private lesson to get to see these beautiful instruments up close, and learn more about the history of the gamelan."

When we arrived we saw only one table occupied with two guests. So we sat and the waiter gave us menu in English . Prices were on 35%-70% higher than in Instagram menu. We asked , why prices are higher? They said it‚Äôs a new menu. So we stood up and went to the table where two other guests sat and left just 3 min ago and we picked the menu on their table: prices were as in Instagram , menu was in Indonesian. So we brought menu to the waiter , and he left on saying  it‚Äôs an old menu . We said to him that it‚Äôs the menu that was on the table where other 2 guests just left.

At first we only ordered snacks like french fries, chicken wings and banana fritter.  Surprisingly, it tasted very good.  The fried bananas are crunchy and the bananas are sweet, but the brown sugar is not too sweet. It's perfect.
Then we tried the vegetable fried rice and meatballs with vermicelli and ketupat/tipat (rice cake boiled in a rhombus-shaped packet of plaited young coconut leaves).  The fried rice is delicious, but the meatball soup is so so. I don't think that ketupat/tipat fit with meatbalk soup üòï.

The chef and staff are ü´∂üèª,"One of the best Sushi restaurants in Denpasar and possibly all of Bali. Ate there 3-4 times in a span of 1-2 weeks.  The food is amazing and always made correctly. The chef is a wonderful person and very passionate about his establishment and it shows in his work and his sushi. A friendly person, great conversations, easy going and makes great food. I‚Äôve ordered the Oishi roll, Chicken Tampura roll, Gyoza, Edamame. Every single item came out perfect and exceptionally delicious.  There‚Äôs a reason I keep coming back.  The staff are some of the most amazing people I‚Äôve met, from being greeted at the door to the table side manner is nothing short of A1.  A not so hidden gem in the Denpasar/Gianyar region, worth the travel. Atleast in my opinion.  I will continue to frequent the restaurant.",New place only 2 months. Authentic ambience of sushi houses in Japan. Service is great. Food fresh and tasty. Good pricing.

We were in our honeymoon and liked the hotel a lot. The staff was very friendly. Always willing to call a taxi or arrange our things. The restaurant and the pool were really clean and nice. The hotel is by the big road and you really cannot walk there because the traffic. We rented a scooter and it took like 15 minutes to go to thw beach and near to most of the restaurants. It worked for us, but if you want to use taxi, it will be expensive to stay long time there.","I like this place, but food in the breakfast not so much choice's",Good staff and well maintained,,
