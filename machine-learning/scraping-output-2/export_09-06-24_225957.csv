The rooms was spacious, pillows are super soft, the best view from our rooms (VIP). However, minus are the bathroom area not cleaned enough as we saw insects, spider web on the chair inside the room, hair dryer not functioned well and somehow the Wi-Fi connection in the room was unstable, even the telephone in the room was not working (I did informed the staff about that, but they said it works while in fact it wasnâ€™t as I tried to call the front deskmultiple times).
Overall, it was a a memorable stay as the view was amazing. Couldnâ€™t wait to comeback!!!ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—","Bed size is medium, enough for 2 adult
Great ambience, great staff. However the path to the hill camp is narrow, enough for 1 medium car only. And need a bit of skill to drive to the place.
Meal price is reasonable","Room Vip 3

Welldone ! ðŸ¤™","Such a peaceful place to staycation with family, the mountain view is stunning. Free access to go to Bloom Garden. Food was okay. Only one think they need to focus about the hygine and deep clean to the closet seated.

Food is so so
Staff are very friendly","We went to book those unique room next to each other, Owl and Fruit. I definitely recommend this Owl room, no complain at all. Only at Fruit room it was the worst room i ever been, it was smell so bad ðŸ¤® luckily the staff was great by helping us to spray the bathroom, still Ã­t didnâ€™t work! Bad experience :(( i hope they gonna improve it in future :))"

The panoramic, breakfast, the staff are so friendly, and the room is so neat eventho it's quite small, but it's okay since we're a couple.
The minus are, there's no WiFi there, they said that they will fix it in the 1st day I stayed, but until I checkout, the WiFi still not fixed. I ordered a dinner there but it was tasteless, maybe you need to improve for your dinner menu because your breakfast is great. Even I just order the basic menu; corn soup, fuyung hai, and nasi goreng, but they're all tasteless.","You got everything here!
Food Very good
Staff so friendly
Wow views! Stunning surrounding but it opens for public!
Weird noise during the night, may be wild animal!

All good thanks","It is difficult to call the contact number, no one answer the call meanwhile we want to collect the facilities of the property.",Beautiful 6 villas inside the blooms garden,
