ChIJ41roP8X30S0RK-xiQNkO1Ng,Bamboo Austin Mountbatur,-8.2624976,115.3845569,"Central Batur, Kintamani, Bangli Regency, Bali, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=15624129333506010155,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3620-3094,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.3,29,,"Worst stay ever. The staff doesn't speak English and doesn't even try to communicate with translators. 2 small (warm) Bottles of Bintang cost 100k. The food portions are even too small for children. Water in the bathroom only lasts for 2min.
The staff was supposed to guide us to the summit to Mt batur. The guide was supposed to come to us at 3 am. When there was still nobody in sight at 4:30am I went hungry and freezing back to the hut. What a waste of money, time and effort.","Huts are very small. No refrigerator, no amenities, no restaurants, kiosks or anything nearby. Only warm drinks, a few cold water bottles in Ibu kiosk, but that's it. We planned to stay for 2 nights, but left after 1 due to the holes in the walls and ceiling, we didn't feel comfortable. We heard stuff crawling on the roof, and saw creatures scurrying about in the corners, open corners of the hut. Not properly sealed. The toilet is outdoors, in the back, with a shower and ground cowered in rocks.
We booked at another place, but due to some misunderstandings they didn't book us, and recommended Bamboo Austin for 2 days, and thereafter we would go to the more upscale place. We left after 1 night. My daughter also got fever and diarrhea, although that had nothing to do with this place. We therefore reasoned it's better to go home, than to stay in an uncomfortable place, and so we did.
It is definitely not worth 350.000 Rupiah pr night.
I will certainly not stay there again.","Wouldn't recommend in cold mountain nights. (Or have warm clothes)

Ups:
+Beautiful place, cozy decor.
+Location on the route up to sunrise hike.
+Good breakfast and welcomed with hot tea.

Downs:
-Very cold night & not insulated room ( bathroom receives wind all around)
-no stable hot water (turned cold after 2 mins)
-No a/c - heater in bungalow.
-No warungs at walking distance.
Oimilar circumstances with a tent basically.

So if it was not the mountains, we would enjoy this place more for this price.

But we came towards evening with motorbike so we were freezing already, and couldn't even sit or do anything but cuddle under 2 blankets to get warm. Which was also cozy, but you know, that's not a perk of the facility :)","As part of the first group of people to ever stay at this hotel, I can confidently say that this is one of the coolest and best places to stay in the Kintamani area.

To start, the location of the hotel is perfect. Not only are you in the middle of a luscious, volcanic area and a 10 minute walk away from Danau Batur, you are right on the Mt. Batur hiking trail! To visit, simply hop out of bed and start your walk. No guides/vehicles necessary!

Built completely out of bamboo, staying in one of the huts is truly an incredible experience. You’ll never feel more at peace with nature than when listening to the sounds of rain under a bamboo and ceramic roof. The rooms provide everything necessary for a comfortable stay, and we were even provided delicious welcoming treats and tea!

Overall, if you are looking for a great place to stay in the Kintamani area or for an amazing Mt. Batur (and everything related) experience, do not hesitate to stay at Bamboo Austin Bali.","𝚂𝚒𝚖𝚙𝚕𝚎, 𝚌𝚘𝚘𝚕, 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚗𝚒𝚌𝚎 𝚊𝚌𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚖𝚘𝚍𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗 𝚌𝚕𝚘𝚜𝚎 𝚝𝚘 𝙼𝚝. 𝙱𝚊𝚝𝚞𝚛 𝚑𝚒𝚔𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚟𝚒𝚊 𝙿𝚞𝚛𝚊 𝙿𝚊𝚜𝚊𝚛 𝙰𝚐𝚞𝚗𝚐."

Cannot express enough how much we loved this hike. Our guides were absolutely brilliant, funny and so helpful. They are very hands on, and have great knowledge of the volcano, and were more than happy to help anyone in need of assistance. We were provided with headlights, a bottle of water each and a simple breakfast before ascending. The hike itself is fairly easy, a 3/10 in difficulty I would say. Although I recommend wearing shoes with a good grip as the surface can be quite crumbly.

Due to it being a busy location, there was a fair amount of human traffic jams and congestion as everyone made their way up. Hot drinks and food can be provided at the top by friendly locals. Plenty of space for everyone to spread out and benches are put out so everyone has somewhere to sit. Unfortunately no toilets so you'll have to find a quiet bush to empty your bladder.

Some of the local guides sang and played guitar as the sun came up and it was a truly magical moment. Overall it took just over 3 hours of hiking (and 7km total) to ascend and come back down. The descent can be harsh on your knees so take it easy.
Honestly cannot recommend enough. An absolute highlight of our travels and a perfect way to end the six months in South east Asia. Thank you to all who made it possible 🩷","Great adventure and experience.  Loved it.  One in a lifetime experience.
Waking up 1.30 AM and picking by the driver at 2 AM and  started hiking at 4 AM and around 6, everyone was on the top of the mountain focused on rising sun. Magical.
I hope organizers give more details to the participants, like how the difficulty level, asking questions, and health issue's if anybody may have.
Also,  i have experienced that there were lots of loose stones and everyone should be informed before. Again,  it was an amazing experience. Loved it.","Fantastic experience. Breathe taking view. Be careful with the tour organizations because not much details they give about hiking and climbing. If do it for the first time, it may be a tough trip.
Life time experience though.","!!!!PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE!!!
We were forced to PAY for an entry ticket which is totally fake (100.000IDR/person) and also had to pay for a guide to walk up the mountain.
We did not want to hire a guide so we decided to follow the road with the scooter which the lady said it was okay to do so!
After 3 minutes of driving we were followed by 5 scooters with 10 local people following us and insulting us!
They told us we had to pay and we are obligated to hire a guide (which is totally a big scam, as you don’t need any guide to walk neither to pay an entry fee), the entry fee was already paid earlier that day on the main road!
They started to scream at us and be very aggressive verbally and physically.
We started to feel very scared for our life! We decided to turnaround and went back to the main road!
This is a huge TOURIST SCAM and we are not the only one with this story! Please use your common sense and AVOID this place!!!","Well worth it. Good trek. A bit of traffic jam at 3 am to get to the base to start the trek.
Trek is great. Sunrise is awesome.
What would be great is that there is proper disposal of garbage of left over food at the sunrise point, as there are tons of flies otherwise which makes the experience a bit iffy and one wants yo move down quickly. Also a must yo conserve the beautiful spot"

I highly recommend it to have a trip with these guys whenever you're in Bali, you'll not regret a single bit!","Super friendly and helpful tour guide they took incredible pictures and videos as well. They are also very skilled driver, very accommodating. The 4x4 are also in good condition.
A member of our group went on a hike and she couldn’t make it to the top so one of their teammate have escort her back down with care! Absolutely recommended.","What an amazing adventure! The car offered ample space with its large wheels, and even on rough terrain, every bump was a breeze,made even better with the assurance of seatbelts.The comfort level was truly outstanding!

They kindly gifted us complimentary rechargeable LED caps that emit a cool and stylish light, mantappp.

Our first-ever trekking adventure was a delightful and effortless walk, guided by the remarkable Made. His warm and friendly demeanor, along with his genuine care, elevated the experience to another level. And let's not forget his unparalleled photography skills that added a touch of enchantment to the entire adventure.
From this elevated spot, I had the privilege to behold the breathtaking magnificence of Mount Agung, Mount Batur, Mount Abang, Mount Rinjani, the Indian Ocean, and Lake Batur, all unfurled before my eyes from this singular, awe-inspiring vantage point.

Furthermore, the tour encompassed a stop at the Kintamani Bats on the return journey, introducing an additional element of distinctiveness to the excursion.

Truly unforgettable! 🚗✨🏞️",Fantastic tour with some amazing people. Thank you for spending your valuable time to show us a part of your wonderful country.,"I recently had the pleasure of experiencing the Mount Batur Tour with Bali Expedition, and I am truly amazed by the exceptional quality of this tour. The entire experience left me in awe and I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a remarkable adventure.

One of the highlights of the tour is the new 4x4 Sunrise Vantage Point Private tour. What sets this apart is that it requires only around 10 minutes of walking, making it accessible for all. From this vantage point, I was fortunate enough to witness the stunning beauty of Mount Agung, Mount Batur, Mount Abang, Mount Rinjani, The Indian Ocean, and Lake Batur - all from a single breathtaking location.

The thoughtful provision of free cool LED rechargeable caps added a delightful touch to the experience. The comfort of the largest 4x4 in the region, accommodating up to six guests, made the journey even more enjoyable. It was a pleasure to have a private tour exclusively for me and my friends, allowing us to truly immerse ourselves in the surroundings.

Bali Expedition ensured convenience at every step. The pick-up and drop-off transport from my stay in Seminyak, makes it hassle-free. Additionally, the tour included a visit to the Kintamani Bats on the way back, adding an extra layer of uniqueness to the trip.

I must mention that Made, our guide and photographer, greatly enhanced the tour experience. His skills behind the camera captured the moments perfectly, and his warm and friendly nature made the journey even more enjoyable.

In conclusion, my Mount Batur Tour with Bali Expedition was an unforgettable experience, filled with incredible sights and impeccable service. I am grateful for the memories created during this adventure and would wholeheartedly recommend Bali Expedition to anyone seeking an extraordinary and well-organized tour experience in Bali.

Thank you guys for making my journey with my friends truly exceptional!"

I was a solo traveler and did a private tour because I didn't want to be slowed down or rushed by anyone else in the tour. We started the hike in the temple, without having to walk that long 3KM on the road like the a lot of people did. The hike up was moderate difficulty. But, we got to the top of the mountain an hour early before the sunrise. Everything was included in the tour (from food, coffee/tea, snacks, water, etc - and I had multiple of them!.) But the best of all is that Dolores was extremely supportive throughout the hike, a great person to talk to, and didn't rush me at any point while we were at the top. We walked along the top to get different angles and views and stayed up there for a long while and were one of the last ones to leave. We got to see a beautiful sunrise. The moment I saw the sun ascend above the clouds behind Agung & Batur in the horizon, I knew this was one of the best travel experiences I had ever done.

Don't hesitate to book him!","Dears, I would like to leave not just a review, but the gratitude coming from my heart and soul! This man Dores (I hope the name is correct) just changed my life. The experience  was breathtaking. It taught me a lot. And I am so so so thankful to the guide because he calculated time just especially for my physical abilities, so we had enough time to rest each second I wanted. He took care of everything we needed to make it to Batur. But also the most important part, he knew that even if it’s cloudy we will see the sunrise and the marvellous view from the top of the volcano. So we waited a bit more and climbed higher to see whole island from the top of the Batur. He shared the history of it and also some local facts and traditions. But guys, can you see what did he do with my iPhone camera? He was like a professional videographer, photographer! I can’t thank him enough. I was travelling alone whole time and he made the most beautiful content I ever had so far 🥹 With all my love, thank you! P.S. there are a lot of videos as well!!","Dores is a great guide. We met him at Batur, and we climbed up to the top of the mountain with him. The pace was good, we could stop whenever we wanted. Once we were on the top, he reserved a private spot for us to enjoy the sunrise. There was a blanket on the ground and two pillows for us. He prepared a tea and breakfast. It was delicious 😊. It was the perfect timing to propose my girlfriend, who said yes, and Dores made a perfect environment for us. 👏☺️
I can recommend him without any doubts. Thank you 🤗","Dores was my Mt Batur hiking guide. He is a truly passionate local Balinese who is professional, safe, accommodating, helpful, and friendly. He adjusted the hike to our needs and shared fascinating knowledge with us. His passion and professionalism has made the experience unforgettable. If you are planning for a hike up to Mt Batur, he is definitely the right guy! Highly recommended!","A friend gave me Dores' contact details for climbing Mount Batur. I thank him enormously and recommend him with my eyes closed.🙏🏼 I had an incredible experience and I think I'll remember it for the rest of my life. Everything is included in the price and you just have to let yourself go. He's a great guide and also a great photographer who will give you memories for life of this experience, alone or accompanied. 😊 Thank you so much Dores, see you soon my friends"
