The sound of the rainforest, the hosts that make you feel like family, the fresh fruits from the garden, the delicious and beautiful cooking, and all the guidance about where to go and what to do. Can highly recommend this place.","I had a chance to visit the homestay in the upper area of Sudaji village in April 2022. The room, toilet and the garden are clean and very well maintained. The pickup from the parking lot will take you on a short but breathtaking motor bike journey along the winding tiny pathways amidst the beautiful green rice fields. Everything is so green and beautiful with very friendly and helpful host that make it a good place for a quiet weekend hideaway. The homestay also serves Balinese dishes that are so Buleleng, authentic and delicious. I will surely come back. Highly recommended!","Beautiful Homestay in the heart of Nature.
Everything is very clean and well maintained.
Host Dekha with wife Sunny are warm hearted people who cared about us best way. Their care and most delicious food gave us real Home-like feeling.
Place is located about 250 meters away from the road. Pathway crosses rice field. It is very quiet and peaceful place.
Great for meditation and yoga, backpackers and trekkers, nature and adventure lovers.
RECOMMENDED!",We had lunch here. The food and hospitality were great.,"The best home stay we've ever been to! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
The owner met us on the street and showed the way to the homestay, the way there is a bit tricky ;) He was very helpful (took us to the local doctor, showed a nice place to have dinner, made us hot tea with ginger and lemon etc). The room was clean and nice. You might not have hot water, but it's not a big deal cause the weather is hot and the water is just cool. Breakfast was delicious and it was true Balinese experience. They have nice garden with lots of flowers, fruit trees. I regret we didn't stay longer there. So if you are planning to visit Sekumpul waterfall, I suggest choosing this homestay!!!
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
