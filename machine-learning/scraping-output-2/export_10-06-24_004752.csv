ChIJu8T3AvY80i0RmdPpizXOOPg,Fivelements Retreat,-8.5425972,115.21647410000001,"Mambal, Abiansemal, Badung Regency, Bali 80352, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17886272649477870489,OPERATIONAL,+62 361 469206,resort_hotel,"resort_hotel, hotel, lodging",4.6,482,,"Edited: We faced some issues with the restaurant on usage of Chope vouchers and it also did not record our breakfast orders for the next day, which meant having to call back and clarify and wait for our food, which could all have been prevented. I had to repeat and explain the situation to multiple persons, which was frustrating.

This resort is a stand-out and I hope that it will continue its spirit of excellence. I love the attention and care to preserving as much of the original trees (building around some of them). I love how there is no air con in all public spaces like the reception, spa, and dining room. One might think this is contrary to the luxury hotel expectation, but it lives up to the sustainability it champions and still delivers on service and quality of stay. We loved how private and quiet it was, though not the easiest to access, but that is its charm, to be as integrated into nature (love the spa by the river) as possible.

I would say that not everyone would like this place. But if you are looking for a quiet getaway, alone or with a special someone, this is a beautiful option to consider.","Fivelements is an absolutely phenomenal wellness resort. I feel immensely grateful that I have been able to spend time here. It is a magical space of peace, bliss and joy nestled in an otherwise chaotic world.

Everyone I met at this resort was lovely  - from the other guests, to all the staff members. The staff were genuine, kind and willing to go out of their way. I had some amazing conversations and good laughs with people here!

I would also recommend all the activities offered, including the morning yoga sessions, tarot readings, village walk and wellness treatments.

The food is outstanding - fresh and very delicious. Everything is made on site and all the produce is all local and organic. It's becoming rare to find food of this quality anywhere. I am looking forward to coming back to Fivelements soon.","Loved staying here and would definitely come back! The staff are amazing! The private pool outside the room overlooking nature was great to relax. The plant-based meals at the restaurant were all very delicious. Breakfast a bit heavy on the carbohydrates and would suggest adding more options with lentils, beans or chickpeas. Yoga every morning was great. The wellness and massage treatments were very good though on the pricey side for Bali. Service was truly 5-star! Thank youüôèüèª","This resort is like a little piece of heaven, ideal for a peaceful getaway. It has a unique wooden design that creates a calming atmosphere. The staff are incredibly welcoming and attentive. They serve delicious vegetarian meals, adding to the healthful experience. Each villa boasts its own private pool with stunning views of the river and jungle. Additionally, the resort offers great facilities like a yoga studio and treatment rooms, perfect for relaxation and rejuvenation. It's an excellent choice for anyone looking for tranquility and a bit of luxury.","What happened to this place? I used to love coming here and bringing friends to share meals. Their raw menu and raw food use to be the BEST I‚Äôve had near ubud.

I went back today after few years and they no longer have a raw menu and the food quality is a disappointment.

I paid almost 400k for a tiny sandwich and 2 drinks and there was nothing special about it.

The staff smell of cheap perfume, they barely speak English and unable to answer basic  questions I had regarding some items on the menu.

I am happy to pay high prices, But the food quality and service no longer matches, which is a disappointment because I use to love coming here."

Tried out the place since it's located next to a car wash. So while waiting, we prefer to have some brunch.

They have indoor and outdoor seating and on the second floor too. And all of them are nice and breezy which is good for air circulation in this pandemic times üòä

We ordered some drinks with potato wedges and burger. To my surprise, the burger was good! I even order one more to take away üòÅ
It was Pulled Pork Burger. The pulled pork is tender and not too spicy, so kids actually like it. The burger comes with fresh salad or with optional french fries.
But, I think the plate for the burger is a bit too small since the food keeps falling out from the wooden plate and customer with kids like me would probably need to cut the food in smaller size.

And one more thing, the waiter and waitress are very friendly even though my daughter broke their glass, I'm sorry üôà.

Overall, it's recommended to try!üëå

Edit March 2024:
The food is still yummy!","I want to share a good feedback!  Next to the cafe is a car wash and tire service!  (one owner) and while they washed my car and looked for a hole in the tire, I calmly drank coffee, had a snack, used the Internet and had a great time.  On the second floor it is not hot, the wind is blowing and it is very good.  The owner is a cultured and pleasant person, I immediately liked it, we had a nice conversation!  The service is excellent, the food is delicious, but the cooking is not very fast, but of high quality üôè Thank you) Now knowing that you can relax and drink coffee next to the sink, I will come more often)","They have good food and good coffee, i came here many times","Nice place and well decorated but food and drink is just so so. When I got there, it was rather noisy. Be it from the neighborhood (next to a workshop), from the street (the noisy motorcycle oftentimes), or from the cafe itself (seems like they're fixing something). Service was good. Toilet was smelly.",There are almost no options for vegetarians on the menu. I had to make do with snacks. The coffee is very good. The sounds of karaoke and music from a nearby tire shop spoiled the impression a bit.

The food was absolutely delicious: well executed original recipes with fresh local ingredients. The tasting menu is worth a try!
Excellent drinks as well.
Service was attentive, kind and professional.
The setting is gorgeous, lush, well maintained grounds.
We will most definitely be back.","Such a beautiful location. Very tranquil and quiet next to the river. Lots of green plants and trees. The coconut cappuccino was really good! One of the best coffee I had here in Bali. We decided to have lunch there as well. Laksa soup was very tasty. Not too salty, and lot of flavor. Mushroom soup was good. And the super food salad was also very tasty . But not really big or enough to be sustainable as a meal. They should have served bread with it or more nuts. Overall worth a 5 star review.","Fine dining at it's healthiest. This is the best food I have ever had in Bali. The fact that it's Vegan or Vegetarian has no bearing on how amazing this food is. This place is also beautiful, amazing bamboo architecture in the restaurant, nestled in the jungle over looking a fast flowing river giving a great soundtrack to an amazing meal. Its quite secluded and out of the way, Google Maps directed us down a pedestrian only road, which was fun on the scooter. But it's more than worth the effort.  Not cheap but well worth it, an very important lesson in how healthy food can taste better than anything else.","Very healthy and unique degustation.all dishes are plant based, paired with healthy clean juices and shots. Staff is friendly as well. I guess it's not a peak season there were no other people. A bit too quiet. Not vibrant at all.","10 out of 10, excellent all the way from the reservation , I let them know I would come to celebrate my wife's birthday and they even surprised her with a cake with a candle and the happy birthday message.
Highly recommended!"
