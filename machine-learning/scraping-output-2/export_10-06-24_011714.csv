For the second dish we ordered the lemanja bowl which was ok, but we definitely had better smoothie bowls in other cafes.

The staff was kind but due to the overall experience I doubt if we'd return here on our next visit to Bali.","Beautiful restaurant. Friendly Waiter View on street or green gardens. Swimming pool seating.
For sure, a hidden gem.
Meal freshly prepared and delicious.
Adi, the manager, even came to check if everything was okay.","Beautiful, nice place.
There is a swimming pool, greenery around, good repair.
Ordered breakfast asparagus. The portion is very small, I didn't eat a bit, I need to order something else. Coffee is good.
There are no comprehensive breakfasts or packages, included with coffee, for example.
Therefore, the price for a visit is much higher than similar places.
Breakfast is tasty but as it seemed to me empty, without something unusual, just bread, eggs, ham, and asparagus nearby.

shower head is a bit broken, i didn't get good amount of water while showering because it was leaking from other spots.

the place was quiet, i like it.

i also like the location, it is not the best but 6-7 mins to padang padang beach with bike is fair enough so i enjoyed being in between of the beach and the center of petjatu.

good and quick communication with owner/manager. best!","I stayed 4 days. The hosts are very friendly and responsive but I'd sadly not recommend this place to friends.
When i checked-in the Wifi didn't work, there was no soap, the toilet seat was broken and there was a big cockroach in the closet but Yudi was very supportive and helped me immediately with these inconveniences.
Kitchen & common areas were dirty and didn't look maintained for a long time. There were no hangers in the closet and no daily room cleaning, which would be necessary as the bathroom&toilet becomes a swimming pool after taking a shower.
Above average amount of ants and flies everywhere.
There's no main road so no traffic noise but as the hosts are not present at the property, my nights were sleepless due to the party youngsters staying in the remaining rooms and drinking. As the house gate stays always wide open, I didn't feel safe here. Everyone could enter the property and it seemed to me like the neighbors invited people over.","The accommodation itself is clean, but unfortunately there is a serious insect problem here. Countless ants and caterpillars are already crawling outside the door. They come into the room under the door and crawl around on the floor.
