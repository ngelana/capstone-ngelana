Recommending the king's room located above because normal rooms don't give you much of a privacy.

We then had a small villa with spa which was really beautiful, but sadly the water of the sap was so cold (and cannot be regulated) that we simply couldn't use it.

Food is good but a bit too european oriented. Would be great to have a few more original things on the menu","We have just spent four nights here from our honeymoon and had a lovely relaxing time. The staff are lovely and we found the food to be good, including the bread! No issues with ants though I think some local cats come because guests feed them - would be better if people didn't do that I think!!

The views are absolutely gorgeous and the pool is really wonderful. We got the honeymoon package and the flowers and romantic dinner were charming and delicious!

We tried the downstairs room and the upstairs villa, both were great for different reasons and we had no issues with noise even though people were staying upstairs.

I can see that it might be a bit pricey getting around if you're being careful with the budget as it is out of the way and costs a bit to get shuttles to local restaurants and the beach so you might want to factor that in, but if you're happy to spend a bit more the quiet location and breathtaking views are worth it and staying in the hotel is an appealing option!","I stayed for two nights and it was extremely comfortable. I had seen some reviews in advance and was concerned, but the hotel is hard to access and the approach is like a dirt course.
It's better to give up on walking and rent a motorcycle instead during your stay. You can rent one from as low as $7 a day, so it's not a big problem. All other services were conducted through WhatsApp and were very comfortable. The cost of a taxi charter to Ubud seemed high at about 600K?, so I contacted a travel agent myself and arranged a car for 375K.(There are no Grabs.)

As for the food, I generally found it delicious. The toast is indeed hard, so pancakes or smoothies would be a better choice.

I think a stay of up to three nights is good, and I recommend it.","Really great resort! Ideal resort if you want to relax and stress-out.  Itâ€™s quiet, the pool is great and also nice to do a workout in the gym. But what made our stay was the staff! There are so helpful and friendly and you can always get  (room) service by WhatsApp. Especially Erik & Bombom, but the whole team is amazing! Would definitely recommend.","The views from this hotel are absolutely breathtaking. The rooms are modern and the beds and pillows very comfy. Staff is very friendly and helpful. If youâ€™re looking to just stay in one single place, do cross-fit workouts (they have a fully equipped cross-fit style outdoor gym) and hang out by the pool, then this is the perfect place for you.
However, if youâ€™ve planned to use this hotel as a base to visit sights in east Bali, we wouldnâ€™t recommend this place (unless you have your own car or scooter). The hotel is in a very secluded area and itâ€™s extremely difficult to get an app hailed taxi from the hotel, impossible actually in the afternoon. So your only option is a cab/driver organised by the hotel and that will be at a much higher rate. We couldnâ€™t do all the planned excursions in the area as we simply couldnâ€™t get a cab one afternoon.
The food menu was also very limited to our surprise."

Rooms were super clean and we had an amazing view. Also there were a lot of facilities with the pool, the sauna and the gym.","Sunrise Paradise is one of my favorite resorts in the world.  If you are coming for a healing, balancing, or detox program, I can't recommend it highly enough.  I have done several detox retreats, and I can easily say this one was the best.  The raw food is incredible, the rooms are comfortable and beautifully decorated.  The views are magical.  The service is from the heart, and five star all the way.  The pools, jacuzzi, cold bath, and sauna are a real treat.  If you're looking for a place that will help nourish you in every way, or a program that can help you heal and regenerate, look no further.  This is a true paradise, and I hope I am lucky enough to be back often.","We have just eaten here. It was not good. We ordered 2 times the burger. The bread suppost te be homemade. But it taste like oven bread that was under cooked. So we did not eat the bread. The fries were good, but way too  much salt. We ordered dessert. 1 time the carrot cake. It was not carrot cake and did not taste good. 1 time the brownie. The brownie tasted nothing like brownie and was really dry, tasteless, it was not edible. I did not eat it and send it back to the kitchen. The price of the food was way to high for the quality that you get (burger for 130.000).","We went to this place for lunch because the hotel next door where we were staying didnâ€™t have great food. We were delighted to find such a charming place, with beautiful view and very friendly staff. The food was amazing, I had the vegan burger and it was perfect ! (Extra points for the home made fries and bun). My bf had the beef burger and was very pleased as well. The juices and smoothies were also excellent ! Bravo and thank you Sunrise Paradise!","Just love it! The style, the quality, the service, the food, the location, and more. Sauna is quite proper, the best weâ€™ve seen in bali. Food is fresh and yum, had the mahi 2 nights in a row. Love the buildings and design quality. And last but not least, the view and nature setting, Divine ðŸ’–"
