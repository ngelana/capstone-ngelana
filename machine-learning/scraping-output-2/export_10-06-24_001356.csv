Unfurtnally I can't give 5 stars due to the women in front of the temple trying or more pushing you to buy a Sarong
I said no I don't want one.
Then they said, you can't go into the temple and I answered fine then no temple for me.

Suddendly they said OK you get a Sarong at the entrance.

There is a sign saying donation for the temple. BUT
At the end the entrance is 50000 or maybe depending on from where you are
As they always asked first where are you from...

I'm tired of Bali people or Indonesien people in general thinking every white person is rich
I wish I earned more but I don't","Ticket price: 50k/person
Parking: free
Sarong: free
Just another balinese temple with good architecture. You can skip this if you have visited other temples in Bali. It is costly considering that you will spend a max of 5-10 minutes taking pictures of the temple. I wish there was some guide or information provided to understand the temple better. Sarong will be given at information desk right opposite the temple.","Fine temple but I don't get the hype. Lots of pushy vendors, it's a 15 minute stop and costs 50k pp (not donations only) feels very steep for what feels like a very commonplace temple experience in Bali. That's like 2 lunches per person at many warungs!

Showed up at the same time as a bus full of French tourists. People smoking all over the grounds. Wouldn't recommend.","Compared to Pura Tirta Empul, Pura Kehen was deserted. That was great! It‚Äôs a 13th century Balinese Hindu temple with a gorgeous ancient banyan tree. 50k to enter like most other temples.","We went around noon and we had the place to ourselves. I liked the temple being so old and rich in detail. Also, the large tree looks like it's hundreds of years old. We paid 50k rupees for a couple but we had to haggle down from 100k. There are no prices anywhere, so you don't even know if you should pay for a ticket or not, but anyway!
On the downside - and this is a common thing to the majority of landmarks and attractions in Bali - there are no billboards or any kind of info for tourists to understand better the history of the place. One would enjoy it much more if more context was provided."

Skin was crispy and full of flavor.!!

Not expensive and Damn good value for money...

The Temuluwak Curcuma drink goes well with the dishes and is highly recommended. If u see it...grab two as its extremely popular and runs out of stock quickly..!! Only to be found in small local warung. You won't find it anywhere else...","The greatest local restaurant in the area, with 30k/person (60k for 2) you will have Babi Guling, soup, tea. The owner also very friendly and she can understand English ‚ù§Ô∏è.
I would say it even better than famous Babi Guling restaurant in the Bangli town.
A little inconvenience because of the fly, but it will not bother you if you wave your hand.",,,
