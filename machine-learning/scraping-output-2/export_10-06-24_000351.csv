The staff responds to chats/orders so fast! Super friendly and attentive.

Highly recommend the deluxe cabin with hot tub, especially for couples. They even sell the bubble bath soap for 65k.","Love it! I was super surprised at what a good experience this is. I‚Äôm here now and i love it! It is high tech meets nature cabin, meets Bali. Wow!!! Clean, but expect an ant or two living on the patties. I love the windows, looking into nature, and the blur feature. I was shocked u can use the app to order anything and everything, even massage to the room at 200k. The ride here was a bit long and bumpy from Ubud. But i would come back again. One note- i wish they had soap for handwash near the sink. Otherwise very good.","Very cute and technologic place, but far from attractions and downtown. You need a scooter/bike or you need a Grab/gojek/taxi. At night, most drivers DON'T want to bring people around bobocabin since the road is dangerous and dark. In the morning, it's fine!

The bed was ok but only 1 small bed cover, no other bedsheets so we had to fight for it all night üòÖ.. also, I hope you don't mind the ants and insects, you're in the middle of the jungle so there will be insects in the room, especially in the bathroom. Food was not amazing, it came from the small restaurant in front. Service was great though!
In general, very nice experience, but we were not expecting the taxi struggle.","A new experience glamping (glamour camping) like hotel concept. You could enjoy the jacuzzi in the night while listening to the tropical island nature. Also grilling, definitely worth to visit","We were stayed at deluxed with hot tub room for a night, and it was a really relaxing and joyable place to stay, far away from the bussiness of the Ubud, a tranquil and natural ambience surrounded by trees, it was unfortunate for us as the rice field was just got crop but didn‚Äôt loose that stunning view. Room amenities was quite complete, however you guys need to upgrade the pillow to thicker one, it was too thin. As well as the blanket was too small for two. Breakfast was great and the service by the staff was amazing, really helpfull. Prepare yourself if you got room down in the valley, lots of step to take."

The room is spacious enough. The bed is big and comfortable. Shower has hot and cold water and even has a mini fridge. The property is situated a bit far from the center so if you want a peaceful and serene environment like me then this place is perfect. It‚Äôs not hard to get around since motorbike rental is also available at the property. The breakfast is good - 4 toasted breads, scrambled eggs together with ketchup and yellow jam and a hot tea. Of course my stay would never be amazing if not because of NOPI. She is an amazing host, accommodating, hospitable and helpful. She is very easy to talk and communicate whenever I have inquiries or problems. I stayed here for 3 nights and it was an amazing stay that I had in the outskirt of Ubud. Highly recommended!","Thank you for your place! Calm, beautiful and peaceful. Thanks Alex for delicious pasta and potatoes with avo and shrimps! A little bit dangerous road but it's ok","Friendly staffs, located in the middle of few finest rice terraces. Whole villa with 4 quiet double rooms environment with a nice pool, though it's not close to the township, probably is the only thing should be considered about.","Good enough for family vacation, simple but wonderful place to go. It best when you can wake up in the morning and walk on the road to see the sunrise with the beautiful landscape of rise field, coconut trees, and cluster or ducklings finding their mom on the field :D","I've never iamgine i would stay in a villa just like this. The best part is not the view because we have passed the harvest time, the rice field has turn into dead brown field.
But during the night is the magical part, when you look up you'll see million of star and when you look down to the rice field at the night you'll also see million of star. Okay not star but fireflies. Million fireflies is surrounding the villa area. So wherever you see you'll see glittering.

The villa room is modern and very well design with glass balcony door. The bathroom is a little bit unusual, it's open air, people on the street can actually see us inside the bathroom, thankfully they have the curtain to cover it up. But very unique, so ladies if you're uncomfortale with this open bathroom ask for the ground floor room, the ground bathroom is semi open (with wallbrick)

The staffs are the true balinese courtesy and kindness. They will welcome you like you are the part of their family.

The food is standard. The pool is a little bit too small. And maybe is you're travelling without vehicle this remote area might not suit you.

But if you're the one who seek the pure solitude, place where maybe to do some meditation or just stay away from crowdness, this is the place to go."

Very nice and relaxing place, we recommended this place!","Great place for healing, relax and privacy when you are holiday in Bali.  Closed to nature of Ubud","Had a fantastic holiday at Ayawana Villa, the facilities where amazing, the communication with the owner was excellent. The property is extremely beautiful with fantastic views. The villa is presented to 5 star rating. Clean, comfortable with everything you could want. Every little thing has been thought of and provided to make your stay the best it could possibly be. The staff are quiet and give you plenty of privacy. We had the holiday of a lifetime and cant wait to go back and visit again...","We went 10 people to this place and we stayed for 2 nights, we really amazed with the place. The place is very comfy for family or friend reunion/gathering.

The bed rooms are more than enough to occupy 10 people, there are a swimming pool with greeny forest view without noisy neighbourhood.

There are 2 living rooms (indoor and outdoor) as well as 2 dining rooms.

The host provided us with homemade bread breakfast together with pineapple jam and eggs.

The host also provide meal service with excellent chef who cooked us delicious pasta and lambchop barbeque along with red wines.

Definitely I will get back to Ayawana villa for next Bali holiday and get the host to arrange everythings.

Many thanks to the host and the chef."

Spaghetti Bolognese contain pork (for the Muslims and Jews to keep in mind).",We ordered the chicken satay and Soto ayam which were really tasty. The staff is really friendly and the service is quick. Suksema :),"It was a very positive surprise hitting this Warung! Our first choice for the night was a restaurant near by that is under deep renovation so we kind of did not know what to do. So wandering the road we got here. It is a very new place and very nice. Off course it will get better with time but the food was really good. We ordered Nasi Goreng, Sate Lilit and Kerang (shells). All good and with good and balanced flavours.
We had a nice bottle of red wine, an exclusive Chianti Classico, with us and it was a great matching and pairing.
Owners where around so we also had a nice chat after dinner.
Keep up with the good job and hope you will have a very great success.

The surroundings and the villa itself really make you relax. Even though the villa is located in a really quiet part of Bali there are some of the best things you can see nearby. There are many coffee and rice plantations you can explore, an Elephant park and a little bit further also the Besakih Great Temple. Also the breakfast is very good and you even get the room service. The whole service here is on another level. If you are looking for a nice and beautiful place to stay and relax in Bali this place is a must.
