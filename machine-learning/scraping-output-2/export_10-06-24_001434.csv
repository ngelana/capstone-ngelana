Had an exceptionally tasty coffee made from salak at the end of the tour while having a chat with the guide and owner, Kongking about its medicinal properties (high in antioxidants).

Would love to get my hands on some of this fruit and coffee when Iâ€™m back in Australia although I think Iâ€™ll be hard pressed to find it.

Beautiful scenery from the cafe too!",Explore the many varieties of salak( snake fruit)! Bali has more types then any other indo island. Come see a local farm around for 100 years (: they make products and have a beautiful view. Bring the fam or anyone. Local experience.,"Surprise, i have hever seen, never eat, never drink.  Very recomended to visit.","Great place to visit. The owner and farmer is very welcoming. We had the the coffee and tried the candied salak, he will walk you around and have you taste many Salk fruit. Wonderful experience.",Great place to stop for some delicious coffee and chat with Kongking about salak fruit. Very nice man!

We went to a local farmer producing arak, got coffee at the house of a family living in a small village and went to the salak plantation. Afterwards up on a steep hill through the jungle on small roads, driving was very safe, but exciting, too. From the top of the hill we had a great view to mount agung. At the end, a very tasty local lunch and sarak coffee. Would definitely recommend this!","AMAZING TEAM for everyone very welcoming and take a good care for me and my group from Malaysia! We have had an memorable experience.
