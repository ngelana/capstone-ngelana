It is a very nice and remote property that comes with a lot of beautiful plants, a swimming pool and very beautiful rooms. The staff is very friendly but most of them do not speak English for which reason communication was only possible via Google translate. The rooms are clean and spacious but lack a closet. Room cleaning is only available upon request. As it is a remote place there are no restaurants close by and the food from the hotel restaurant is very low in quality. They literally use the same ketchup based sauce for almost all eight dishes that they offer. Fortunately it is possible to rent a scooter in the hotel to get around. To go to a decent restaurant it is a 20-30 minutes scooter ride. I highly recommend this place for stays for up to 1-2 nights.","the service is good. you must pay for breakfast. the rooms are clean. shower with hot water. very good swimming pool ambiance especially with the rain. moto rent is available, you can rent directly there and go to explore the small island.","Awesome place and a great value!  Beautiful and quiet location with excellent landscaping.  Rooms are fantastic with comfortable bed, wifi, ac, and hot water.  We payed 3x as much for similar quality accomodations on the rest of our trip in Indonesia, so this is a great value!","This cottage was extremely natural. It was really beautiful cottage that I ever stayed. There were so many flowers. It makes the situation was extremely life. I was love to the shower, it's could change into the cold and hot while taking a shower. Besides, the landscape here was very unique and natural. The foods here were very delicious. You may also buy foods and drinks here.
The distance from here to restaurants around 1 km by motorcycle.
The owner and staffs were very friendly and kind.

In the future, the street to go to cottage could be fixed and please give more lamps during the way to here. In addition, in room, we need wardrobe to put our stuffs.
But, overall is very mantappuu
That's all.

Thank you","Everything about this place is absolutely stunning. Amazing scenery, great food, heartwarming family. Without any doubt the best place I did so far! Congratulations ❤️❤️❤️"
