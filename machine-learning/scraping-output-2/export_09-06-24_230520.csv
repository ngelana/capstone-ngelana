ChIJccJKfKaL0S0RscBg_2rExfY,Langgahan Waterfalls,-8.317437199999999,115.2724345,"M7MC+2XF Banjar Langgahan Kangin Langgahan, Kabupaten, Kintamani, Bangli Regency, Bali 80572, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=17781834667572379825,OPERATIONAL,+62 852-3782-0962,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.7,95,,"Amazing hidden gem. The ride there was an incredible tortuous path down into the valley. There is a bonus mini waterfall right before entering langgahan, which is a part of the same  spring system. Last 0.2 miles are unpaved but are really fun on a scooter. Feels like you’re in a movie.

Changing room, bathroom, and for 20k… what else could you want.","Stunning waterfall and not very busy when we visited. (Feb)  Park your scooter where the road ends and walk the beautiful road to the entrance. I don't recommend riding down as the trail is slippery in wet season.  The waterfall isn't too cold, should be easy to jump in for refreshment. The bamboo bridge will need fixing soon, some parts are corroded and brittle.","Super peaceful waterfall with a nice kept territory with good stairs, bridges,gazebos for rest, toilet, changing rooms etc. The ticket is just 10k. The water flows in greenery and there are boulders fluffy with grass in the river so all feels like a fairy or hobbit land. Awesome for a rest in the nature.","You should go there !! It’s a little hard to find. Not a little actually it is very hard to find. The directions by google maps were not very accurate and we ended up lost in the country side. But with the help of some locals ( who actually didn’t speak any english), we managed to find it! And man, was it worth it! The place is actually a little piece of heaven. It’s completely cut off the civilized world and it’s so beautiful. The waterfall is beautiful and you can actually swim underneath. The water is so clean. The guy who is taking care of the place is one of the nicest human beings we ever met! Very helpful and ambitious man. He wants to make the place even nicer and has a lot of plans for it. Don’t be discouraged, you will love it.",Easy to go with bike. There is a reception at entrance. It deserve a chance for visit
