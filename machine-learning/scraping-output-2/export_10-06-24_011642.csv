The attention was very friendly and super attentive. The rooms, bathrooms, kitchen, all facilities very comfortable and clean. A quiet, quiet place with a lot of nature. I 100% recommend the place.",What a treat. Excellent accommodation at very low price. I had very low expectations for this place but I‚Äôll be staying here every time I‚Äôm in this part of Bali. Staff is amazingly helpful and continually keep the place clean. Quiet location (I‚Äôd suggest having a scooter to get around or using grab). Fully equipped kitchen to do your own cooking. For the price you won‚Äôt find anything better.,"I liked my stay although it is a bit far from everything but you can always book a gojek to go places. I was on the top floor and I liked it there, there is a terrace with lots of sunlight and views, somehow I felt very good those days. The staff doesn't speak English and it's a bit difficult to communicate.","Good money to value.
Good internet, free  kitchen,towel,water, parking. Big rooftop could use some gym equipment or just a pulupbar. One toilet with a shower for 2 rooms of 16ppl can get crowded if fully booked. Not my case.
The gated community is very nice , with no special views, just a skeleton building close . üòÄ
Owerall a few days in a dorm here is totally ok . #MrBali83 approved üëå","Pretty poor quality place, I've been in better homestays throughout Bali. I stayed since the other options were too expensive. I had bugs crawling on the bed. The place looks quite run down. View is okay. I still don't know the layout of the building, never got it explained. And the location is inconvenient, since you must get a scooter to properly explore. The homestay looks like it's in a gated community away from the main street."

The only reason we didn‚Äôt give the food 5 stars was that the butter chicken don‚Äôt have a lot of chicken in it.

Owner Oliver is very friendly, and all the service staff are welcoming üôè and very efficient
Food is freshly prepared and delicious üòã
The pani-puri is excellent..so light and tasty! We also love all the thali sets that we order. The naan and chapati are light and well made!
If you are keen on Indian food with a fusion twist, I would highly recommend this restaurant!
For sure, we will visit again when we back to Bali","I absolutely love the atmosphere at this restaurant! The staff are incredibly friendly, making each visit a delightful experience. The food is simply delicious, with the pani puri being a standout favorite of mine. Highly recommend for anyone looking for great flavors and a warm, welcoming environment!",Food was so good! Only managed to take a photo of the Pani Puri as I was too hungry to not start when my curry arrived. Really enjoyed it & not too expensive in comparison to other Indians. And they do Nutella Naan!!,"Nice place and food for people craving on Indian food!
The lamb biryani is the best !!"

No hot water AT ALL

No shower gels or shampoo

Helpful staff but very low condition of room

It‚Äôs cheap but bring your expectations to the lowest possible","Stayed at this place twice, at the start of our trip in Bali and at the end to wrap things up. Was hosted by Om Alex, such a welcoming and friendly man who'd look out for you and give you some advices on where to go around Bali.

The first time we stayed, we had a room on the third floor. Loved this one. Simple, bright, (artificial light), large, and equipped with a cold AC. The second time, the room was on the second floor. Smaller room but still adequately spacious. Same cleanliness, brightness, and good temperature. Both times the hot water runs well, even in the sink. Furnitures like the wardrobe and hanging racks are available in the room too. Unfortunately, for both times, we weren't able to get a room with the balcony.

Another plus point is they have a refrigerator and drinkable water to refill your water bottle (the one on the 2nd floor tastes better than the one on the 1st).

Overall, it was a lovely stay. Will come back again if visiting Uluwatu.",Great value room in a good location 10 minute walk from the main street,Sleep and surf....rumah WJ rooms and suites....is the place to stay......ciaoooo,Very weird smell in the bathroom

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, ensuring a comfortable experience with their great communication. The environment was pleasantly quiet and clean, and the location was perfect. I highly recommend Gracia Homestay and look forward to staying again in the near future!","Gracia homestay was our home for 1 month. Amazing location with unique atmosphere: near the most beautiful beaches, shops, awesome road and big golf fields where you can walk or run. A lot of trees and beautiful views around, no noise, only nature.

Nice and clean rooms with AC and beautiful balcony, where you can watch sunsets. Big kitchen where you can cook everything you want. Nice swimming pool, not big but always clean.

Eli is a kindest woman and always ready to help you anytime! Highly recommend this place for stay!","Thank you very much for the friendly welcome.
Close to the forest, clean air, amazing sunset views.
About 15 minutes to several beaches for surfing.
The room was clean as was the linens, towels and bathroom.","I have been living here for the second month and I really like everything. A chic area, a chic room and great sunset views. It is a beautiful, comfortable and safe place. Mrs. Ele is very responsive and kind, she takes care of her guests as her children and constantly treats durian with the fruits of a mandarin guava. This is the best place I've lived. The rooms are well cleaned and give clean towels. Thanks a lot, Ele.","Brand new & very clean homestay,  owned by a really lovely Indonesian family. Your balcony will be overseeing a beautiful jungle. There's also a  cool rooftop for stargazing or sunset watching. Not right next to any stores or restaurants,  but once you have a scooter you'll be there in no time! Also 10-15 mins to all the nice beaches.
The building & area is still a work in progress,  since everything is so new, so it might look a bit empty at the moment, but I kinda like the peacefulness of that :)
Definitely recommended! Bring some ear plugs if you're a late & light sleeper (thin walls/doors), otherwise the place is really nice and quiet."

Thanks to the Waiters and Managers for the best Korean restaurant in Seminyak.
Delicious hot freshly cooked with ras bibimbap and samgepsal.
Everything is fresh, tasty, appetizing, pleasant music.
Several types of lemonades, iced tea, water with lemon and cucumber, desserts. my favorite japchae and yangneom chikin are cooked to perfection!

We love discovering new places for ourselves and in Kuta, Seminyak this is definitely the best Korean food restaurant!

And they also offered us a high chair for the baby, my baby is 9 months old, and the high chair was very comfortable.

Many thanks to the owner for opening Korean cuisine here.

The atmosphere is also complemented by candles, pleasant music and an air-conditioned zoga.
great in one word. I Definitely recommend this place to CorFood lovers.

There is also MAKGEOLLI AND SOJU!!!
MAKKOLEY AND SOOOJOO!!)

The only highlight was freshly made bibibap.","Best Korean Buffet, very delicious, from appetizer to dessert.
Should try their beef bulgogi, samgyopsal, and toppoki.
