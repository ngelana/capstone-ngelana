Great service and a very informative explanation of the process of coffee making. This was followed by a stroll through the plantation with hands on explanations.

And then the highlight is brewing and tasting the different beans on offer.

Highly recommend this tour!","Bali Beans impressed us with an enchanting tour of their coffee plantation. The exceptionally friendly staff offered in-depth insights into the sustainable and ethical aspects of their coffee journey. An unexpected meeting with the owner brought forth a fascinating tale of planting coffee seeds as a child, culminating in a flourishing coffee tree collection. If you're in search of top-notch coffee accompanied by warm explanations, Bali Beans is the ideal destination. Noteworthy is their distinction as one of the limited sustainable and ethical luwak coffee producers in Bali!","Friendly staff and wonderful detailed explanation of the coffee production process. A family owned business - passionate about their beans and the environment.

A portion of the sales go to the community of local farmers and everything is organically farmed and nourished with organic compost, made from the husks of their cherry berries. Would recommend a visit!","We loved it so much. Sintia was amazing and so welcoming to us. She showed us coffee sample tastings and the process of the different beans. We also tasted the red berry. Sintias barista skill was fantastic and she was very good at serving us at a high level. She made our day great. The food was very good and all prepared and cooked on site. We loved it so much we went again on our way back to buy coffee beans which we previously forgot. A lovely balinese family owned business, farm and home compound. Highly recommended.","That was one of the best experiences in Bali. You can dive into the coffee culture starting from the theory of growing coffee beans and brewing coffee to tasting the beans and different kinds of coffee. All of it is for a decent price. The people here are incredibly hospitable, kind and fun. Thank you so much for the day!"
