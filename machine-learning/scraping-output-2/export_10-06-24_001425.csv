The couple owning the place, the people working there are making you feel instantly at home, and treat you like family.

A beautiful property, and a very special place, and community, not only for the guests, but the children in the village as well.

I booked the little cabin and it‚Äôs very cute, small, but big enough.

I only booked 3 nights, instantly missed it when I left, so came back after a week. ‚ú®","Where to begin... It's a very special place which I didn't expect when I booked it. So first the rooms, you have several different options to choose from. We stayed in the wooden building, which is one of the lowest in price. It's not the biggest room but the way how it's set up makes you feel instantly at home. When you open the door to the bathroom behind it feels like you're entering a different place. Very nicely made with a lot of green and your own private little creek if you want to jump in there.

The other accommodations are also set up beautifully although some are a bit higher in price so be sure to look up the different options. There is a pool but it's for the private villa so be aware of this.

The surrounding is made beautifully as well and you can see that the design of the place is very well thought. The owners of the place also made a whole culture centre for, but not exclusively, the children of the village to learn about Balinese dancing, writing and making music. We did a evening walk with Agri who can tell you all about the local village, the Balinese culture and many more things. Definitely worth doing. Plus there are many more activities that the owners provide so be sure to check them out.

A very beautiful and intriguing place and we were kind of sad we only booked 2 nights. If you like the quite, unspoiled beauty of Bali and want to stay with a very nice couple who can tell you all about it stay here.","Beware !!! Beware !!!
A one star is underrated for this stay.
The rooms are very dirty, with stains and bugs on the floor. The bathroom was unbearably filthy with broken taps. We have booked for a two bedroom Villa,where one of the bedroom was far  from the main bedroom and had no bathroom attached or anywhere closer, we have complained immediately about the situation to the manager, Ari. Her response to situation was terrible as she asked us to adjust for the night with a broken tap and a filthy room. The next morning we went again to discuss the matter to Ari, she came along with her husband and started rudely talking to us and shouted at us saying, this is what is available and if you don‚Äôt want it leave the premises. We have never experienced such a rude behavior from anywhere else, so beware !!! Beware !!! before booking this place.","The best place to be if ever you need to go around the multiple spots all over Karangasem! The rooms & hospitality is more than what you could ever ask for in a lodging. The place itself gives back to the village through their many workshops, initiatives, & activities.","A great getaway location with a spectacular view of Mt Agung and surrounding paddy fields and local gardens. The owner and staff are very kind and helpful. We trully enjoyed the stay and for sure will come back again for certain traditional ceremonies scheduled in 2022. I certainly will recommend this place to friends and family.

Thank you very much, Ari & Pak Lanang. üôèüèº"
