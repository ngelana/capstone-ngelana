Tejakula, Kabupaten Buleleng, Bali 81173, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=2615461338194024347,OPERATIONAL,+62 362 3436305,lodging,"resort_hotel, hotel, lodging",4.5,57,,"Beautifully appointed bungalows within a private, tranquil setting. The pool, day spa and yoga shala were great places to retreat to each day. Staff were extremely attentive and made sure we had everything we needed to make our stay a memorable one. Can't rate this place highly enough. Wonderful experience.","Gaia-Oasis Abasan Mountain Retreat is one of the most beautiful places I have found in Bali and is most probably one of the last hidden paradises of peace and tranquility on the island.
The vast property lays on a hillside and the buildings are nestled amongst the trees. There is a wonderful scent of Frangipani flowers all over the place. There are different accommodations to choose from, there is a 13-m pool in which extended swimming is possible and the place features Yoga and Meditation halls with stunning views. The main building  is the restaurant, where delicious meals are served three times a day and free tea and flavoured water is available all day long.
This place is perfect for people who wish to get away from the mainstream tourism, who love nature and are looking for a way to disconnect from a 24/7 availability. Internet is available in the main building/restaurant.
Everything is very clean and well maintained. What makes the place unique, however, is the people: I met three of the founders and they where very hospitable and made me feel like home far away from home. All members of the staff are very friendly and go to great lengths to make sure their guests are well accommodated.
Thank you Yen, Helen and Mariah for unforgettable moments. Terima Kasih, I will come  back.","Love this place! The mountain retreat is super relaxed, has beautiful bungalows surrounded by nature! Perfect place to calm down and recenter / bring into alignment one's mind! On top, the place is a non-profit, supporting the local community!","Abasan wasn't initially on our list as we wanted to stay near the beach. Since we stayed in Gaia Oasis first,  which is a part of the complex, we thought we might try both places . When we were taken to Abasan ( property offers free shuttle) we were mesmerised by the views, the sounds, the whole atmosphere! The cottages are well apart from each other, so you really enjoy the solitude. Well equipped with gas kitchenette, good size refrigerator and a tea kettle. Coffee/tea/sugar supply is abundant. The property is 1 hr walk from the beach but you don't really need it as the swimming pool with salt water on-site is bigger than the everage size and perfect for both a relaxing swim and a little sun tanning afterwards. There is a restaurant on the premises which offers a good variety of organic local cousine, unique herbal drinks made fresh from local growing leaves and really healthy smoothies. Last but not least, I would like to thank the staff. Representing the best of Balinese approach, we felt le part of their family.
And, of course, having their signature massage treatment every day,  makes you feel you are in haven.
A few practical notes: 1. Everywhere you go is a combination of  paths and steps, so bear that in mind if you try to avoid them. 2. Mozzies, midges and sand flies-please use the repellant spirals all the time and, ideally, bring your own fumigators ( we brought the ones that ho into a power point), you can also buy their own made spray, containing local citronella oil. 3. Its a rural area, local village houses are in the proximity  ( you cannot see them but you can hear them), so be prepaired to hear roosters in the morning-I personally love waiking up to their  singing! We were told about that before we came, but, really, that was not bothering us at all. Even the occasional local karaoke on Fri night is Balinese style: relaxed happy music, it didn't bothervus at all, and they usually finish before 11 pm. Well equipped with all that knowledge we are already planning our next visit","Hidden paradise. Hut's in a beautiful forest, the place is cared for with consciousness and love. The service is really friendly and aware. The hits are special and beautiful. The food is really great, plus massages and the two yoga shalas as well as the beautiful pool. the option to take a shuttle down to the ocean resort is really great as well! Thank you so much for this experience!"
