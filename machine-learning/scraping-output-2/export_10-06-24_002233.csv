I went to the swings with a private photographer. This was amazing. The dress plus entrance fee was 461000 Rupiah. Doesn't include the photos or photographer.

The place is very professional and you can see safety is important since they strap you onto the swings. If you're not to bothered with pictures, there's not much else you can do there.

The services are good and prompt . The behaviour of the staff is friendly and good . It is must visit,"Was fun and a great experience. The people assisting and running the swings were funny, safe, happy, and made us feel safe with enjoying the moment.
Great photographers, even with our own phone cameras, it's worth paying for the professional photos for the effort on our personal cameras.","400k for experiences
150k for clothes rent
50k for entry extra person

Did you think: you spend enough money to experience the games and are ready to take beautiful photos? no, you need to spend 200k more to receive the image via airdop? Haha
Easy money","It was a great experience. Very well organised.
What’s good:
- The overall experience
- Professional photographers can be hired and they take amazing pictures
- You can rent a dress (You should definitely rent one if you want better pictures)
- Definitely don’t miss the main adrenaline swing.
- Organised and clean

What could have been better:
- It is slightly far from main bali
- Slightly expensive
- Try visiting in off season to avoid large crowds"

-don’t have to get there at 5am, our local driver said that’s when it is the most crowded, we got here at 8am, plenty of food left
-components: pork skin, shredded pork, minced pork, deep fried innards, seasoned liver, blood sausage; if you are like me and don’t like innards, do customize when ordering at the stall front (just point!)
-not quite sure what the prevailing prices are, ended up paying 30 a pop","One of The Best Babi Guling near Ubud.
Price is so cheap
The Meat combination is awesome, Pork Skin is thin and crispy.
Very much recommended, if you really hunt for Nasi Babi Guling then you must come and try this Bu Desak.
They open only morning from 05.00 - 10.00","Was lucky to grab a plate of Babi Guling before they close down for the day.

The sambal takes the centre stage in this Babi Guling but that isn't to say that the meat and the sauce weren't good. Every one of the items in the assortment was amazing.

What's even amazing is it's only 25000 for one plate. They charge local prices even for foreigners and serve great food.

By the way they only serve Babi Guling and maybe beer if you want one during a hot Ubud morning.","The best breakfast in Ubud Bali near Tejaprana resort and spa is Babi Guling Bu Desak, dengan kearifan lokal, most of the customers are Indonesian or Bali citizen. Is real tasty and you can choose the size of the crispy skin of pork. The price are very reccomended low only 25k in rupiahs. Lets support the traditional and home business here. Enjoy. #mattheusr"

I can recommend soup. It was tasty. It comes with rice as a side dish.
Stuff speaks good English.They provided us with mosquitoes spray and food for the fish when we ask about it.
Atmosphere is good and of course the beautiful view to rice fields.
I can notice that it was not enough soup to wash hands in toilet room.","The ambience of the place is amazing. Located along rice fields. It is very accessible as the entrance is right along the road. The only negative is the satay is cold as if it just came out of the refrigerator, same with the fries which came as a side to the calamari. Aside from that it was a great dining experience.
I would also like to commend the friendly staff Debi and Putri-great service!","Very nice sitting here, especially in the evening, beautiful setting to sit outside :)
They also serve shisha (hookah) here.
And there is nice music playing, tropical remixes of popular songs!
The food is of good quality, but not very special or local.
We really enjoyed being here and went here twice!","It's unfortunate that this place seems relatively unknown, considering how much space they have and how charming some features are, like the fish pond and extensive outdoor play area.
While the food was ok, I wouldn't say that it was amazing.

But still for drinks and play area this place is awesome !",Service was good and very friendly can’t say the same about the food especially for a place like Bali where food is generally fantastic this place was below average. I would say its a nice place for a beer or two as the atmosphere is nice. A bit on a pricy side

The location is quiet and relaxing, surrounded by greenery and a beautiful waterfall. The room was clean and spacious. What we enjoyed the most was the amazing service from the staff; they were so friendly and welcoming that absolutely made our trip more fulfilling. The Indonesian breakfast we tried was also amazing! One of the best meals I've had in Bali. 10/10.","I can't recommend this hotel at all. It's true that it's very hidden, but that also means there are many animals, and my husband and I were constantly nervous about leaving our room. The walking path is covered by trees, making it inevitable to encounter spiders and other animals. There is also no views, as others are writing. The route to the hotel is very steep, and most taxis won't take you all the way since they can't go back. While others might appreciate the staff, they messaged us every two hours on WhatsApp, asking when we were coming back to the hotel, what we were doing, and why we weren't staying at the hotel during the day. It was very annoying. We arrived at 1:30 AM and planned to sleep in. However, at 7:30 AM, the receptionist called to say breakfast was ready and that we should come to the restaurant. It felt too much like being parented.

Although it's advertised as a 5-star hotel, it feels more like a 3-star at best.","HORRIBLE service- advertised as private pool and private villa but it was actually just a plain hotel with only a shared pool and other people on different floors- not a villa.
We asked to check in an hour early and was told no- understandable so we came about 5pm (check-in was 2pm) - realised it was pretty much a scam, hotel’s response after FOUR hours of making us wait in the lobby was that they cannot check us in as they can’t risk a negative review. In a very secluded part of Ubud aswell that took us 50 minutes to get to, we had to get another taxi and find another hotel at 10pm at night. Would never ever recommend or return- worst experience in Bali. Worst part was it was advertised as a 5 star hotel and my birthday that we were celebrating on the day.","I will recommend this place to stay based on overall great service and quality.
This Villas located in very quiet area of Ubud. Only natural sounds around you. I had a room with private pool and It was a great addition.
The room was huge and very clean. Everything was there - converter for charger. Bath and pool towels, hair dryer and so on. The Staff is very welcoming and I enjoyed having little talks with them. I also took advantage of the on site spa. Massage was great and pedicure was done very careful and very nice (US is lacking on it).
Location, first, seamed a little far from Center of Ubud but technically it was always 20-25 min drive straight (no curvy roads and so on). If you check the map up north from the villas , you will find those famous Rice Fields surrounded by nice cafes (like Tis Cafe, Coffee Club and so on), swings and other places for cute pics.
Overall, Ubud Hills is very nice, beautiful and quiet place to stay.","I LOVED my experience and my stay at Ubud Hills Villa & Resort. It was one of the most amazing resorts I have ever stayed at and Our room was huge, spacious and very clean with a private pool and ceiling to floor windows and balcony overlooking the amazing rainforest. There are even multiple waterfalls within the resort. You can get a floating breakfast and also a flower bath. The team here are so friendly and the service is impeccable. Everyday, when we returned to the resort, they would ask us what we got up to and were absolutely lovely. The team definitely made staying in Ubud a special experience. I would absolutely go back again, it was an absolutely magical stay. The view and the experience were absolutely unbeatable!"

Overall amazing restaurant, definitely recommended especially their hot cappuccino was incredibly good👍","Four years ago we stayed in the villa next to this kedai to celebrated our wedding. Then in the last day we came there, tried the food (Balinese food and desert) and the drinks and we really liked them.

Is nice because is not in the city center and it makes the place quiet but you can’t go walking to practically anywhere.
Another problem it’s that if you are going to stay more than two nights, you only have two options for breakfast so that maybe gets repetitive.
The rooms are really clean but you have no drawers or closets, you only have it on the bathroom.
Despite those things, it’s worth it to spend your days in Ubud in Keraman Suite because you’ll feel like in a little jungle paradise only sharing the space with two more bungalows.","I am very happy to stumble upon this place, which is very private and designed traditionally.
