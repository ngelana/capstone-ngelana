They also focus a lot on small details such as leaving small samples of shampoo, conditioner, toothbrushes and toothpaste. The villa has spectacular views, the room is always clean. The hotel staff is charming.","The view is stunning. This place is great for short stay. There‚Äôs a shared kitchen you can use to cook as they don‚Äôt serve food. There are amazing places to eat around within a 5-10 min of a scooter drive. You can rent a scooter with them to go around.
To finish the staff always greet you with a smile which is a plus.","My stay at this Uluwatu homestay was simply amazing! Beautiful accommodations with ocean views, attentive hosts, and a perfect location for exploring Uluwatu's attractions. Highly recommended!","great atmosphere, beautiful sunset view, clean and comfortable room. The family that owns ancala go above and beyond for their guest.",Small simple and fresh place. Really good for you who looking for silent place full of peace. You can enjoy sunset and the sea from they garden.

Nico, his partner and staff are all so welcoming and made our stay a memorable one.
I wasn‚Äôt too confident on a scooter and Nico even took me for a quick lesson.
The rooms give such a warm feel and are well maintained. The outdoor shower was a really nice touch.
Location-wise, it‚Äôs great. Really easy to get around on a scooter or through the app, Grab.
Upon booking, we soon received an amazing guidebook about the local area which his partner made. It was really useful.
Overall, I highly recommend La Kreyiol. A perfect place to stay!","We had an absolutely delightful stay at your apartment!
The owner was very accommodating and friendly. He was always available to answer any questions or offer recommendations.
One of the highlights of my stay was being able to rent a scooter from the owner. It made getting around Uluwatu so much easier.
The room itself was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We loved the outside shower and swimming pool.","The bungalow is great, the bed is nice, the outdoor shower is also nice and unique. The garden outside and the pool is great places to hang around if you just want to relax. The owners are really nice and friendly.

I can't complain on anything. If you don't mind riding the motorbike the place is a good spot too. But to us who is not that comfortable and not used to driving the motorbike, the place is a bit off. It's a bit too far to walk to the city, so we had to use the taxi all the time. If that's not a problem for you, then the place is five stars, but if you like to walk then this might not be the best place.

I also must say that Uluwato might not be for everyone. Most people would love the beaches and the many restaurants and shops. But I think the whole area was too much adapted to tourists. The restaurants and shops didn't feel very Indonesian or Balinesean. It's not s very genuine town I think. But then again some people probably like it that way. These things has not much to do with La Kreyiol, but I just want people to know what place Uluwato is, before they go here.

La Kreyiol is definitely worth five stars.
Uluwato might be five stars for some, three stars to others.",A quiet and serene villa with the most hospitable host. We had a wonderful 4 night 5 day stay. The room was clean and comfortable. You can also rent a scooter to get around with great restaurants and beaches nearby. We will most certainly come back here again.,"Absolutely 5 stars review! Wonderful place quiet, simple but characteristic, lots of plants, nature, flowers around the small villas. They are in the middle of the jungle so you will only hear the rooster singing. Wi-Fi works well and it‚Äôs a very safe place.
The room itself is clean, well organized with Balinese style furniture and decor. Loved the bamboo shower tap and the bathroom door; Bed quite spacious.
Nico the host is super friendly, easy going  and have lots of awesome tips for restaurants and must to go places around the area. They also offer breakfast and renting scooter."

I Made was a welcoming host, along with Mira and Virgile, all of whom I became friends with during my 1 week stay. They helped me get acquainted with the area, and were there to greet me as I came and went on my many adventures.

The room had tall ceilings, beautiful lighting, temperature control, quality furniture, and a very comfortable bed.

The WiFi was on par with the rest of Ulu. As a digital nomad I was able to get lots of work done in my room, in my personal backyard, and in the cafe pool area between my outings. Met some cool travelers who stayed in the neighboring rooms and even saw a monkey in the trees just a short distance from the infinity pool.

Would definitely recommend this place and plan to stay here again when I visit Ulu in the future.","We had an amazing stay at the new Petra Bianca üôèüèª Couldn‚Äôt ask for more. Virgile was really helpful with everything we needed (Laundry, Scooter rental, Restaurant recommendations). Would definetly book again.","we had an amazing stay there , the place is new , so it's perfectly clean ,the staff is so kind  , the bed are confortable , everything was perfect . highly recommended",I had the most enchanting experience during my stay at this villa with a jungle view.

Amazing location, great service and beautiful rooms and outdoor area",Really beautiful place in a very good location,"Very nice, quiet place. Clean but beds were hard as concrete with no blankets for the bed. Only a thin sheet to cover up .","Anthony is a great host, very friendly, active and responsive to the asks if any. I spent 3 months Jan-Mar in Indahwatu and loved every single day. The place is sunny, with mild winds coming from the hills, though the plenty of shadow. The comfortable rooms with super spacy terrace and well equipped kitchenette made my stay relaxed; I liked the quality of bed, pillows and linen. I loved the sights around the property,especially the shortcut roads through the hills with picturesque views. There are plenty paths for jogging and lots of space for fitness or yoga. Location is convinient for riding a scooter, or long walks; all the Uluwatu and pecatue areasbeaches at within the 5-10 minutes ride distance, any cafe is within the same distanve: many cliff view sunset points around. And the cherry on top is the clear sky, that is perfectly visible to the tiniest detail, since there are no hotels or roads with bright lights around."

If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet getaway in Uluwatu, here‚Äôs where you should go. The place is really well kept, with the host living on property. The rooms were beautiful and the staff was extremely helpful.

The kitchen, pool, and living spaces are shared between occupants (from the 4 rooms) but the host has a few rules set to maximise privacy, which was really nice.

The sunsets and Tom (how can we forget him) are a highlight!!",Really nice hosts. Made us feel welcomed when we arrived. The room was clean and the pool also. The location itself was is a bit difficult to be found from local Gojek drivers so make sure to book a personal in advance when going to the airport.,"Firstly; the airbnb itself is beautiful and the common area is open and comfortable. Location is fairly close to the beach and cafes via scooter or car.

Both my partner and I were looking forward to the last leg of our trip in Bali (Uluwatu) as we had never been so naturally we were excited to stay in an airbnb that was advertised so beautifully.

Overall, we were extremely disappointed in our stay due to the following reasons:

- Sheets had yellow stains all over (pillows and doona cover)

- No mosquito net around the bed to keep bugs out, we were bitten and bothered each night of our stay

- The bathroom is separated by a curtain that doesn‚Äôt shut out noise, steam, moisture, bugs or smells

- WIFI did not work or worked very slowly

- No basics were provided besides water. This was the only Airbnb we stayed at that didn‚Äôt have some sort of shower gel or shampoo, only hand soap which was empty.

-The pictures of the villa are a little deceiving
as it appears the common area is a private kitchen and living space connected to the bedroom.

- Upon arrival we were told to help ourselves to the coffee and fruit and anything else in the kitchen (this was great to hear but the reality was that the fruit bowl was empty and so was the coffee jar)

- The first night i wanted to wash my hair so i requested a hair dryer. I reached out to both hosts on the app (and even tried to catch one of them in the common area during the day) but received no response

- Before the day of checking out, i messaged again to see if we could leave our bags in the common area as we had to checkout by 11am, and our flight was at 9pm. We also enquired to see if we could have access to a bathroom to take a shower as the humidity was unpleasant and we didn‚Äôt want to jump onto a flight without feeling a little refreshed. They finally responded and allowed us to leave our bags however said they were fully booked and showers would not be available. my partner and i agreed that was completely fair.

After checking out, I needed to use the restroom and noticed Tom was in the common area. I asked him if i could quickly use an available bathroom (as no one had moved into the room we just checked out of yet) and he said he needs to check with management (even though he IS management lol). He went upstairs and told me no because the next guests would be checking in early (despite telling us we were unable to check in early when we first arrived). he then proceeded to say that the door to the room has now been locked (like It‚Äôs hard to unlock a door?) and basically said tough luck and that i should go find a spa or day club to use a restroom. Being denied of a human right felt humiliating and upsetting.

This would be fine if we were in walking distance of one however this villa is extremely isolated. (surrounding areas are other villas or peoples homes)

While the above was happening, they informed us that there would be a shoot in the villa and it‚Äôll be a little busy in the day time. I see them finally restocking the fruit bowl,
coffee and buying food for the villa
to make it appear that the place is always lavish with supplies.

My partner and I left Bali that afternoon feeling exhausted and frustrated by our entire experience in Uluwatu. Granted, the rest of our trip was fantastic so it was a sour end to our week.

For anyone wanting to stay in Uluwatu, we recommend the Uluwatu Surf Villas instead.. or honestly anywhere else!",Absolutely love this place!! It has become our home in Uluwatu! Beautiful and peaceful!,"My home in Bali , simply love it. Quiet , silence surround by nature . Tom and Dorothy are simply amazing hosts."
