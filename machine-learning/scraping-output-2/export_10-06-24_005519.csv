There are plenty places around it to buy drinks and grab a snack- near the waterfall there's also a bar (haven't visited) with swimming pool. There's more to do in the park if you want to spend more time there, but quite touristic as well!",Very beautiful and scenic place! You can park your car/bike in the parking lot and then buy the ticket. The ticket is only 20K for locals per person. Then take stairs down to the scenic waterfall. Better bring swimsuit and spare clothes since you will want to swim or dip your toes in the fresh water. There is a temple with holy pool nearby in which you can take a bath. Also there is a resto/club nearby which you can relax while enjoying the waterfall. Nice and will comeback to visit!,"A very nice location and well maintained there are lifeguards at the location as well. They always keeping an eye on for safety. There were some people who were like climbing up to the places that they are not supposed to so they were whistling around and maintaining everything goes according to the safety protocol, you can buy the ticket at the entrance. For us - It wasn’t that much of a hassle. It was very quick walk-through you had to just walk into the area through the nice pathway you can get to the waterfall and enjoy this surrounding. It gets crowded, but still, you have plenty of space to have your own sort of privacy.","Nice waterfall.If you want you can swim in the water where the waterfall goes down. Not sure if there are changing clothes rooms, bur bring extra clothes with you. Be ready to climb few stairs when going out from the area.","Beautiful waterfall. Crowded but you would get enough space to swim around. Limited number of changing rooms. A temple attached to it has some rooms and toilets attached.

Climb can get a little harder but doable. Steep steps. Shops on the way from parking to the staircase are an add on. Nice place. We spent about an hour or so. Kid friendly."

The staff were initially friendly and welcoming. However, I found the service was a bit slow considering there were so many around.
We ordered nachos, which were fresh and tasty, and my mocktail was refreshing.
The reason I have scored fairly low for this place is due to the attitude of the staff member when myself and my friend asked to pay for our stuff separately. We went over to the cash desk, and she was visibly annoyed and was sighing quite heavily.
On the whole, this is an okay place to stop for a bite to eat whilst viewing the waterfall, but I am not likely to return.","Relaxing place with stunning views of the waterfall. Staff really goes out of their way to accomodate, especially our server Ade who made sure we were taken care of the whole day.
Pool is really clean with comfortable temperature and pleasant not too loud music playing.
Recommend this place!","Quality of the food was excellent, only gripes are the overly inflated prices, (damn near LA prices) obviously to trap tourists, and the abysmal service. It should not take them over an hour to prepare food when the restaurant is practically empty with only 2 other tables.",Despite being a bit confusing what we were signing up for at the start (various packages etc) as we just wanted lunch it was a really nice time. The food was delicious and the drinks were nice (although my daiquiri was a bit watered down). The crab and mango rolls were insanely good. We got to try a local spirit as a shot at the end of our meal. It's a really nice vibe at Omma and you can get views of the waterfall and the glass bridge.,"Very nice place with great view of the waterfall. Lively staff, all so kind. Wipra served us and she was very friendly and explained all the food for us as we have vegetarian requirements. Lovely service from her. She made sure everything was fine. The food was amazing, good portions and tasty.
Definitely recommend!! :)"

The staff was amazing and offered to take pictures at no cost. You also get a voucher for free chicken/beef sticks after your tour. Once you walk across the bridge, there is a small bench swing you can use where a member pushes you that overlooks the opposite side of the bridge, along the banks of a cliff.",250k entry each but it is apparently the longest glass bridge in south east Asia. You get great views of the waterfall and beautiful Bali countryside. Recommend going at sunset. Included in the ticket price is a free go on the swing and some chicken satay which was very tasty!,"By Bali prices the entrance fee to visit and walk across the bridge was very expensive .. the price was more akin to what you would pay for a similar attraction in the west.  If you don't like heights and won't walk across the bridge, then there is not much for you here.  But if you can cross the bridge you will see some lovely views.  You can get basic snacks and drinks there too.  Don't bother paying for a tour to take you there, just hire a Grab cab to take you there and back.  It will be much cheaper that way and you can stay as long as you like. Note: you can not see the nearby waterfall from the bridge.","Don’t recommend this place. Ticket is overly priced for foreigners, 250k (16 usd) per pax but it’s not worth it. The view is below average and you can’t even see the waterfall from the glass bridge.
You get much better view in any other hills in Bali.

Better spend the money at Omma Day Club where you get a decent drink for the same price of the ticket to glass bridge and you get to enjoy the nice waterfall view. Btw I am not in any away affiliate to Omma Day Club, just a happy customer.

Don’t believe me, feel free to waste your money.

Below are the pictures from Omma Day Club.",Well worth the ticket price! It was good to see such beautiful scenery here as there are not many glass bridges in my country. And the staff are very nice as well!

The park is well organized with parking, clean toilets, a tiny water park (pool and a few slides) for smaller children.

There is also a good restaurant on site serving some good local Indonesia cuisine.

Recommended…!","Nice place, and nice experience of walking throught the greenery must visit if you like to spend time with nature and birds and butterflies. Calm and peaceful  place. They also have swimming pool inside for the access to pool we need to pay extra price.","Pretty little butterfly park with lots of butterflies. Don't expect them to flutter their way to your hands, the stay to the plants minding their own business, doing butterfly things. There is the indoor ""cocoon"" place where staff will place a large butterfly on your hand and talk about butterfly stuff. Overall a pleasant half-hour, nicely paired with nearby tegenungan falls.","Nice place to see some small animals and bonsai. The main attraction are butterflies. You can see lots of them flying around and their hatching area with lots of cocoons. There was a very friendly employee in the hatching area. He told us lots of interesting facts and information about butterflies. He showed us cocoons and gave one to us to touch and feel it - the one with a hard colorful shell that resembles glass.
So in addition to only looking at butterflies we learned a lot."

Toilets were horrible.","def worth a visit. if you’re in the area it’s a must see and it’s also probably worth a day trip out there. food was just ok but everything else was great. pools, seating areas, views, even the music wasn’t bad. the surrounding area has some other attractions that can be combined for a great day. recommended.","Incredible river club right next to the waterfall. Only 20K entry, which includes a free drink! Beautiful views, delicious food and amazing staff.","Sadly this amazing location destroys the wonderful atmosphere by playing terrible loud and inappropriate music. We feel sorry for the staff that needs to work with it and hope they don’t understand most of the texts that were in the songs 🙏.

The location itself is stunning. Unfortunately you can not hear anything from the wonderful waterfall because of the loud music 😞.

We are vegetarians and had a choice of 3 meals as most of the menue is meat.
The vegetarian food was good and reasonable priced.

To enter this restaurant you have to pay 20.000 Rph! For what reason so ever Asian people from certain countries have to pay extra 50.000 Rph for consumption. This is a very bad arrangement as there should be no difference between anyone visiting this place!

Be prepared for a very tourist active place as loads of tourists busses come to that waterfall.","It's where my tour guide stopped by, so I didn't accept much. (It's all about commission, as you know)

Surprised the meal quality is fairly high tho my roasted duck was utter failure despite being highest $ charged menu.

Unfortunately, it's a basin next to a waterfall, so it's pretty hot and muggy, plus a lot of steps to get in and out. It's probably worth avoiding hot seasons."

Although it can be a bit scary at first, especially if you're not used to walking on glass, you'll quickly get the hang of it and appreciate the unique perspective it offers.

During my visit, it wasn't crowded at all; just our group and another family were there. However, keep in mind that there's not much to do besides taking pictures and admiring the view. It's more of a quick stop to snap some photos and enjoy the novelty of walking on a glass bridge rather than a place to linger for an extended period.","Charges 250000 per person & same will b reimburse for a complementary liquidin term of Soft drink.
If one having Height phobia please dont visit this place it is not for you.","It's interesting that Bali has its own glass bridge. You must use shoes cover provided when you come here which is good. And it seems strong but pretty shorter distance to me, I was expecting a longer walk like 1km.  Entry is $25 for tourist and $15 for local. The background music was a local Indo pop song which isn't my liking and a bit annoying. There are few cafes and coconut drink, ice cream, and Indomaret.",It was a good experience but for 2 adults $50 au for a 5 minute walk I would recommend people to save there money,It's the most expensive attraction for the day. 250.000rp to experience.

They open from 9 am - 6 pm

You don't need pay extra for gazebo or locker because it already include.
I've been ordered some food like friend rice, spring  roll, samosa, and pancakes. The food was so good and tasty.

Overall that place was good especially in Gianyar area, because only few Waterpark there.","It was relaxed as always. We come here eveytime we want to swim. The pool is big enough with a children's swimming pool. There are also 3 slides. Me me unfortunately the restaurant is closed due to the COVID situation. But you can still get pop mie, teh pucuk and Aqua. If you come early between 12-2 pm it's almost always quit so you have to pool for yourself. After 4 pm it gets usually more busy with locals.

A butterfly managed to lay eggs on the back of my shirt which were carefully removed by the carers into the hatchery.

The kids spent more than 2 hours in the water park pools, then managed to devour a pizza each! At the restaurant. Pa' Bagus (Mr good) lived up to his name with great suggestions for the original juices, pizzas, chips for the family. He told us about their intention to complete the Kemenuh experience by the best presentation for a theme park.
It was economical and we spent more than 4 hours leaving very relaxed and calm.

We got a tour of all the plants grown for the teas and coffee tasting, this of which was free, except the Luwak coffee you pay extra for which is fair. They claim the Luwak animal gets let free then only trapped to collect the poop, then let out again etc. however I do think this is a myth anywhere you go, and that the animals aren't let out, they live in tiny cages and are used for this traditional coffee method. If you are okay with this, this place is lovely to go for all other reasons. You can buy all teas and coffee in a large quantity, along with some really nice chocolate and honey they have too. Our tour guide was the loviest!",Currently writing this review as we are participating in the tasting. This place is a must visit if you enjoy variety and culture.

Thank you for having us!,"Great hidden gem!
Peaceful and interesting tea and coffee tasting. The tasting is free of charge, and you receive 13 different flavours and types. The hostess takes you through the gardens and explains the plants used for each tea as well as explains the process in which the coffee is made. There is a shop where you can buy a 200g pre made packet of each tea and coffee tasted.

Just a few metres away is the Kemenuh Butterfly Park and about 5 minutes walk is the Tegenungan Waterfalls. It's only 15 minutes drive to ubud city centre so the location was absolutely perfect for us as we were able to have some relaxing, quiet time at the villa while also being able to go on adventures to popular attractions close by.

The room with the garden & pool view was impeccable and was even bigger and more spacious than what the pictures show. We had a 2 bedroom villa, each having it's own en suite bathroom and an incredible kitchen/dining/lounge overlooking the forest and pool area. Delicious daily breakfast was also included which was a massive plus for us.

Lastly, I want to say thank you to the staff who took care of our space for the week at The Legend Khayangan. A special shout out to Sattio who communicated and checked in on us frequently to make sure that we were comfortable and assisted us during our stay.

We'll definitely be back!",The service was outstanding! Very lovely staff! The location was perfect & close to everything. Only downside is that there was many many bugs in the room as there is big gaps in the sliding doors. Other than that I highly recommend this villa!,We really enjoyed our stay here.

Most disappointing food, hygiene issues and atrocious service. Served cold (not chilled beer) and brought 1 beer mug and a glass (meant for juice) after 10 minutes post 2 reminders. Food was cooked as described in the menu,but completely misleading. Pizza bases were not cooked and 2 out of 3 pizzas had to be sent back for additional cooking in the oven. 3rd pizza had cheese slices on top! Vegetable skewers hardly had any vegetables in the skewer and were served with rice!!! Bruschetta was made with regular slices brown bread and served with lettuce! Kids went to their pool and decided not to have a swim as it was thirty. Would NOT advise anyone to visit this place.","Forty to fifty minutes for some lame pork ribs. We were the only costumers.
Bad food and bad hygiene.
Very expensive. Don't trust google maps on this, it was indicated 75k and we paid 200k per person
Don't come here, it's a wate of time and money","Great service and food was amazing, with complimentry snacks. Nice view as well. Must go place if u want taste of authentic Indian street food🤤",Place was wonderful with nice view from the rooftop. They provided a complementary sweet potato chips which was unique and delicious. Customer service and food was nice as well.,2 mie goreng for almost 300k is perfect rip off.
