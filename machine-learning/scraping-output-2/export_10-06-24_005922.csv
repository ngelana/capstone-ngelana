Words can‚Äôt describe how special Nirjhara is.","One of our favourite ever hotels. A hidden gem that gives a true sense of Bali. Would highly recommend. We stayed with our 10 month baby and they were so accommodating of him too. Lovely staff, incredible massage, great menu and just a beautiful hotel.","What a place! We recently visited Nirjhara following a week of wedding planning in Nusa Dua - rest and relaxation were high on our priority list! Arriving later in the evening after a long drive, we were met by a smiling Windu who assisted us swiftly with check-in. We were shown to our canopy suite and settled in for our first night - which featured a stop at the in-house cinema with cocktails and snacks!

From there, our stay just got better and better - so good that we extended our trip by two days. The service was some of the best we've ever received and the attention to detail was pretty unbelievable. Breakfast each morning at Ambu was exceptional - plenty of choice and almost too much good food on offer! The setting was absolutely sublime and the suites lived up to their surroundings.

We cannot wait to be back - thank you team Nirjhara (Windu, Linda et al.)!",30 mins from Canggu. Great getaway from usual Bali. The staff are friendly and working to ensure guests having a good time. I only wish I stay for 2 nights instead of 1.

Did not had much sleep as the curtains were not fully covered window and the toilet and shower glass made it worse.
The pool is nice and the rice field next to the guesthouse is good.
I didn‚Äôt have any breakfast nor seen anyone eating here at all, so I am not sure how come other comments on great food!?!?
Anyhow, there is a small restaurant at the front but I barely meet any staff through out the day.
During my stay for 3 nights, the room was not even clean once and there were so many gecko poops on the floor :(
My room doesn‚Äôt have a balcony, so after my surf session I have no place to hang my wet clothes.

The good thing is there is a small fridge in the room and they provided 2 small bottles upon arrival.

The location is good if you are not planning to go anywhere but just to surfing on the beach or walk to a nearby cafe. But if you want to go to Canggu or Seminyak, you would need to rent the motobike for 80k per day which is reasonable, but they don‚Äôt have a cell phone holder!! So it would be challenging if you don‚Äôt know your way around!

I decided to grab one day to Canggu and it‚Äôs only 39k , so a round trip is pretty much the same as renting a motorcycle!","Located near kedungu beach, should you want to enjoy surfing. take a night here and voilla !! Room is spacious also great view on some area. When you get out of the room you get to enjoy all the cows and farm landscape.","Absolutely disgusting. The bed linens are filthy dirty. The upstairs sunbed is unusable as it's covered with insects and stains. We stayed in the last room down the alley, it was so hot and dark. We turned the AC down to 16 degree but it showed 28 degree on my dive comp. We spoke to the staff and asked to be moved to another room, he said there is no other room available, but I walked past a fully made and vaccan room going to my room.
The villa is at a remote location as you can see on google map, you will be relying on Grab/Taxi to get around to food, may as well spend that money to stay at a better place.
The stay was a nightmare. Yes, the room rate is cheap, but I expect clean sheets to be the least.  It is just terrible in every way.","Really close to the beach, lovely friendly ladies working here. Cows directly outside the rooms, although tied up and obviously not going to be there forever... Still nice to have animals nearby. Less friendly cat though! Also expect the spiders and ghekos but to be expected in this rural setting. Lovely place for a short stop over.","Location quite far from comfort food, no mineral water, uncomfortable for family travel with kids, there is some bugs in room, the food little bit pricey, and need more light for this room
And the room leaks when it rains
But the service was good and the beer is cheapper than other

The gardens were beautifully manicured, lush and green. We were in awe of every building, with its traditional balinese carvings and incredible detail. We were given some great recommendations, including a barber for my husband, and Joshua District for dinner. Thank you Berlin and family for sharing your wonderful home with us.","Awesome hospitality.. great vibes. Also the home cooked food was awesome. We told the host to make vegan food for us as we are vegan, the taste was awesome. Our cab driver during checkout didn't show up, so the host dropped us to the location, it was a very big help we got. Very generous host. One tip: if you book cab during checkout in this area, do followup with the driver when you still have some time left. Else talk with the host, he can help. Also the guest house has 3,4 dogs. If you love dogs, they are approachable. If you don't like, then also don't worry. They won't harm. Though 2 dogs might bark sometimes, though they won't harm..","Best decision to stay here! We were here for 1.5 months, had daily breakfast (we could tell what we like and don't, when we left early we could take it away, it was always fresh and very tasty), enjoyed the recommendations from the host, the friendly housedogs, the weekly cleanup of our room and the most friendly company of the family.

The villa is super spacious, the upper floor is like a separate flat with its own kitchen and balcony, the fans and acs blasting, the staff is super friendly, the hosts are great. This is a 10/10, we loved it sooo much! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. just give them a message and arrange a good price for everybody!","We loved staying at Silversand Villa! We were here with a group of friends for a guys only weekend that Silversand Villa organized for us: MotoX through the jungle and close to a Volcano, a boat trip with fishing and catching our own dinner (that we later barbequed at the villa), a night out in Canggu... Awesome accommodation, great food,¬†cool activities and convenience as a driver was getting us everywhere and anytime.
We felt so welcome here, and the villa butlers were incredibly warm and hospitable.
The villa is stunning and just as described.  Home cooked breakfast was extremely delicious and I would recommend if breakfast is not included in your rate. There is a new restaurant right up the drive way, so it was extremely convenient to get other meals. The villa is brand new and in great shape so A/C, high-speed Wi-Fi etc worked well. Will be back for sure !","Recently spent 5 days & nights in Bali at the Silversand Villa with a group of friends, for a quick getaway from the daily grind.

From the moment we walked out into the arrivals hall at the airport until we were dropped off there again 5 days later everything was perfect.

We couldn't have asked for more, from the friendly knowledgable driver waiting to meet us on arrival at the airport, to the Villa staff who all greeted us with the biggest smiles, even the 24 hour security team. Every single staff member had a genuine enthusiasm to share their home with us which made everybody in the group feel totally at home and welcome from the moment we arrived.

Eva & Evi took care of our day to day needs like we were family, and cooked for us the most delicious mix of Local Balinese style local, and western food. The Villa staff helped coordinate the itinerary of activities we had planed for the week, and everything happened seamlessly.  Eva & Evi even prepared and cooked the fresh local fish we caught during a days fishing excursion, into the most amazing fresh seafood Banquet.

The Villa itself is Nestled quitely amongst some beautiful rice paddies, and is surrounded by the most lush and beautiful tropical garden, which ensures the utmost privacy.  The beautiful Kedungu Black Sand beach is only a couple of mins walk from the villa and is a great place to watch the sun go down over a few local surfers chasing the waves in.  Or for the more adventurous you can get involved in the local friendly soccer match that seems to take place most evenings on the beach.

The Villa and all it's amenities are spotless and a 5 star standard throughout.  The pool is the perfect place to relax the day away, and the serenity that the lush garden surrounding it creates makes it very difficult to drag yourself away from, when it is time to leave.

If you do fancy a meal out, which is doubtful as the standard of food offered by Eva & Evi is outstanding, there is a new restaurant opened at the end of the 200m driveway to the property, the Fat Hog which also has delicious food, and ranks highly on trip advisor already.

The location is unbeatable, as it is in a still undiscovered and beautiful area nestled amongst the rice paddies away from the hustle and bustle of the main Tourist Strip, and only a few mins walk to a beautiful beach visited mostly by locals, and rarely busy, except for on Sunday afternoon when they all set up Delicious Food Stalls.  Should you desire a trip to the Shopping Strip or a bit of night life the Villa has a driver available 24 hours, or they are happy to arrange rental Motor Bikes for you, which are delivered to and picked up directly from the villa, so you can easily get back into the hustle and bustle shoud you desire.

I cannot recommend Silversand enough. I only wish we had more time to spend there."

Very peaceful environment, with little garden around, wooden forniture, and pillows.","Life Between is new cafe open near Kedungu beach and Love Beach / pantai cinta. I like the atmosphere here as it is so serene to sit in front of rice paddy field sipping an awesome cup of coffee.

Their coffee are so good with right balance of bitterness and acidity. I sipped their Americano and milk-blended coffee like Latte, Cappuccino, and Flat White. They are all  just perfect mix in a cup.

I also tried their pastries, one of best butter croissant in Bali so far.

This place is pet-friendly. They open daily except Tuesday from 7am-noon and reopen from 4pm-6.30pm.

I really recommend this beautiful cafe for good coffee and light bites.",Pet friendly small cafe. Croissants sometimes great sometimes oily. Apple cake and lemon cake taste good,"workers : they have a good manner
cappuccino : it is good 75%

Our favourite Airbnb so far. It is beautiful and has a great view. The pool is great to cool off after a hot day.  We loved the hammock upstairs and the beautiful design.
I would say it is in a quiet place, but you can hear lots of birds and crickets, especially at nighttime, but we loved that. You're surrounded by nature and in the evening lizards come to visit your garden and also we saw and heard a gecko. There are squirrels and we saw some small snakes. It was a great experience.
For breakfast, you get a discount at Little Ripper, wich is a great place, also for lunch. We went there every day and it was delicious! Only one minute walk.
Although the shower and villa might not feel super private at first, because there aren't curtains everywhere, people around do respect your privacy.
Julia informed us about the dogs in advance, they bark when you walk to the villa to guard their place, but they only bark and are actually gentle. So we actually liked the dogs too.
They offered us laundry service, they took our laundry in the morning and returned it in the afternoon. Unfortunately most of my white laundry was returned with orange stains. Including some new clothes. They first told us to sort it out with the laundry lady and that it was from sweat or sunscreen, but that was not possible. So finally Julia called my husband and they sorted it out and Julia made it up by paying for the damaged clothes and told us she would stop offering laundry service in the future. I'm giving 5 stars because the problem was solved and the rest of the villa and service were just perfect. Ayu was always there to help and cleaned our villa well. Ayu and Julia were both very responsive all the time.
Thank you for letting us stay at Sanga#9!","This place is absolutely stunning. We fell in love with it and didn't want to leave; it's even more beautiful than the pictures. We're already looking forward to our next stay here and will definitely come back.

I'm a bit hesitant to recommend it to too many people; this place might get fully booked, lol.

Both the hosts, Julia, and Ayu are super friendly and helpful.

I noticed a one-star review in the section, and I want to help the owner. It could just be a concern, as the owner mentioned there's a curtain that already provides decent coverage. If you really want more coverage, what we did was track the curtain to the corner chair and pin it down with a hair clip, fully covering the window.

One little recommendation for the owner: I think if you simply put a small hook on the other side of the window, guests can easily fixate the curtain all the way across for those with privacy concerns. Honestly, no one is going to put their head in to see what's going on inside.","Oh what a lovely place to stay. The three tiny houses are beautiful designed and equipped with everything you need. A kitchen, storage, safe etc. The private pool was amazing and the while area is so beautiful with the green plants and colorful flowers right around your house. There's a good cafe right next to Sanga which is perfect for breakfast. You can rent a motorbike and the staff is always available and helpful. There are some small dogs next to the very tiny path you have to walk to the apartment which act a bit angry but don't harm anybody.","This place is magic! Wonderfully located in the small tranquil village of Kedungu. Here you can still experience the original Balinese life but do not have to be without any luxury. The house is a great mix of traditional design interpreted in a modern way with all the amenities you wish for a relaxing vacation. Comfortable beds, great bathroom with outdoor shower, a top equipped kitchen, a refreshing pool all surrounded by the jungle, a great vegetation and rice field view. The staff is very friendly, reliable and helps you with all your wishes. You can explore the beautiful surroundings by foot, with a scooter (which the hosts will gladly arrange for you) you can explore an even larger radius. There are several cafes and restaurants around, which are highly recommended and the sunset in one of the beach bars is also an absolute highlight. Surf lessons at Kedungu Beach are such a great experience as well. We are dreaming of coming back.","Sanga #9 is quite possibly my favorite place I‚Äôve stayed in Bali. Each A-frame villa is beautifully designed with a bare foot luxury feel. Beautiful rice terrace sunset view, close to the surf and right next to the best cafe, it gives you the joys of Bali living without the business. The staff are incredible and always ready to help with anything you might need. The villa is very clean and well maintained.

I cannot recommend this place enough. If you are looking for a spot away from the crowds but with the beach and chill vibes, absolutely this is a must!"

The villa is in a beautiful part of Bali surrounded by rice fields in a quiet setting, which is rare this close to the beach these days. The staff, lead by Mr Wayan have been wonderful as well, with smiles and welcomes along with our water melon juice and traditional breakfast each morning. Our kids (and mum and dad) loved the salt water pool to cool off at the end of a day of adventuring. Don‚Äôt forget to check out the Fat Hog for a meal while your here.","I you want peace and quite this is the place for you.

At least a mile away from the busy byway.  400m from the beach. Surrounded by rice paddies it is only a 2 km walk thru them to Tan-a-lot (the back way.  It is the most charming walk of your life!).

The surfing beach is isolated and only accessible by one road.   I walked most of the time.  Sometimes I got on the back of a scooter. (people are friendly!)

Been here two years in a row.   Got the same sweet view both times.

Highly recommended!

Other stuff;
Continental breakfast of croissant and fruit plate and great coffee by the salt pool or in the room was perfect.
No other hotels next door.   Like I said,  quite..
I don't do night life but you have to drive to get there.   Scooter is the way to go.
Reading, salt pool massage, long long walks on beach and Tan-a-lot (sp?) temple for tourist stuff and sipping beer at a restaurant.
10 days went by too fast.
I don't surf but the surfing is good there.  Got a local lesson one day.","I can't say enough on how relaxing Dan and his staff made me feel.  They really made sure that the trip there was full of culture and comfort.  I was asked to join in on Gamelan practice, I got to see a traditional wedding, and other ceremonies.  The food and accommodations were amazing too.  I may have had to fly across the world to go here, but It was a trip of a lifetime.  I highly recommend the trip.","Overpriced, the furniture etc were all run down. No hot water in the shower and the toilet leaked. The toiletries ran out and were never refilled. Staff were nice but tried to stiff us on change from our takeaway and the breakfasts weren't great.","I would think this used to be a nice place but it desperately needs TLC. Things are broken and staff don't care. It is a bit of a walk to get food and you need to traverse through the village dogs to get there.  The hotel information is misleading and it does not have the facilities that is says it does.  Overall,  it is really expensive for a shoddy villa that is out of the way and inconvenient."
