The room was not very big, but it was very clean and comfortable. We did 5 beautiful dives guided by Stephen, who is one of the best dive instructors we ever had. Definitely recommend to stay and dive here!","We stayed at Ocean Villa Dive resort to do our final dives of our holiday, we booked directly with them for a great rate and they arranged our transfer too, nothing is too much trouble for them. We decided to do 4 dives over 2 days with Stephen. He is by far the best instructor we’ve had on this trip. So good that Im thinking of coming back out to do my training here! Our second dive to the Liberty wreck was my favourite dive of the whole trip.","Very clean room and well maintained ressort. If you've the chance, take one of the rooms in the 1st floor with sea view.

A small fresh breakfast was included.
It's a quiet place, surrounded by green trees and rice fields. Tulamben with shops and restaurants is only 300m far.

We did scuba diving for very reasonable price. Starting from the shore, a reef with sunken temple and a wrack are very close by.

Only the Bali typical warm hospitality was not shown by the staff.","We called at 12:30 am desperate for a new place to stay as our previous hotel was dirty. The owner woke up to our phone call and was extremely helpful she made sure we got in to a room quick and safely. The room was very clean, everyone was so kind and the views were stunning. We also forgot something in our room and they drove it to us in Amed beach. Couldn't recommend this place more. Thank you again for helping us!","Just spent a fabulous week at the Ocean villa Dive resort snorkelling and diving around Tulamben. Their dive shop is excellent, and their instructor Steve was able to get me current again after a 12-year break from diving. Diving the nearby Boga wreck, Steve’s special dusk to night dive of the Liberty Wreck (we did it 3 times) and diving from a local outrigger boat and swimming back to shore were all great highlights.

The resort was clean, comfortable, and the staff made us feel very welcome. As well as breakfast we ate one meal every day at the restaurant. They have their own pizza oven. The location is just behind the town and surrounded by farms. However, it is just a five-minute walk around the corner to the local Indomaret shop and restaurants in town. A ten-minute walk straight down to the beach takes you to the entry point for the stern of the Liberty Wreck."

2 stars as the staffs there are very friendly and helpful. This is a very small and cosy accommodation with 6 rooms. Avoid the room near reception as it is noisy.

The pool are quite dirty perhaps little chlorine. If you learn open water, here is the pool for confined session.

The staffs can send you to nearby resto or mini mart any time via motorbike as you like and they will always wait and send you back.

Breakfast: can choose a few items on the menu. I love the banana pancake, sunny side up eggs and bacon. Banana juice is great as well.

Room is outdated, door handles are rusty and abit broken. Shower head are faulty but rain shower is working. Water is hot.  Bath towels and bedsheet a little dirty if you do not mind about it.

Wifi: only at reception area and room no free wifi. Accident happen during my 3rd day and the rat bite off the wifi wire and no wifi to use.","We stayed here for a week. I was sick and couldn't go diving but had a great rest just drinking coffee by the pool. Its a very small place with just a few rooms but very cosy. For the price you pay we thought it was excellent and the staff is super nice. It's just a short walk around the corner from a small minimart and there is lots of restaurants close by. Tulamben is basically only for diving and there's only dive shops there but I guarantee that the stay you'll have here will beat any dice resort dormitory by miles :)

If you're used to resorts it might not be anything special and we did get our stay for a very good price so it might depend a bit but I would warmly recommend it.","Great budget option. I stayed here w my wife and brother not knowing what to expect. The staff was very friendly and the rooms and pool were very comfortable considering the price. They did our laundry for Rp 10,000 per kilo with a smile and did a good job. Good location, walking distance to the dive shops, restaurants, and USS liberty. We had a great stay.","Beautiful place and wonderfully friendly staff. The outside pool area is really relaxed and looks beautiful. Plus you have a perfect view on Agung Agung.
The rooms are really big, clean and tidy. You have everything you need. Just the bathroom is a little dark - but we just showered in the outside shower by the pool!
Definitely would stay again!","Beautifull place, very friendly owner n staff, spacious n clean bedroom with a really nice view. The stairs design could be better but overall it's really comfy to stay there. So worth the price. Sure will be back if I travel to Tulamben again."

It was completely full of flour and the tomato sauce was too sweet. The beers that we ordered had a rusty taste because the beer mats already started to rust. We would never go there again for getting pizza!,"Poor service and pizza
In view of previous reviews, and not having many options for pizza, we ordered 5 pizzas at 630pm for delivery at 8pm. They didn't deliver until 9pm and only then after numerous calls as to why our order was delayed.
The pizza itself was floury, cold, with poor quality ingredients.
Best avoid.","Ordered Bbq kebab with beef and french Fries.

This is what I got:
A miniature-portion of what was shown in the menu, 5-ish french Fries and tiny pieces of bell pepper on the skewers mixed with meet...and the meet.......more than half of it was chewed and spit out on the plate again.
(Also, I got recommended beef, got pork, asked if this really if beef, she said yes it’s beef) I couldn’t bother saying anything but anyway.. walked away disappointed and hungry.",,
