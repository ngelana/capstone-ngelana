It was a highlight for our 9 days trip on Bali. Everybody in the group of 17 people said that it was the most authentic, beautiful and quiet place on this busy island.
The traditional bungalows are lovely and cosy, they are in the middle of rice fields and you get an incredible view.
The grounds are beautiful, they have two very nice swimming pools, you can find variety of local teas and coffee in bungalows - that was very nice.
Good food in the restaurant with nice variety and fabulous breakfast. Nice spa with good and inexpensive treatment.
The staff is very friendly and helpful.
It is a perfect getaway for a couple of days - if you want to get away from noisy and touristy places on Bali.
I am definitely coming back and recommend it to anyone.","Beautiful hotel, designed with the spirit of traditional Bali architecture in mind. It’s located in between the ricefields, which makes for an amazing view. The staff is incredibly friendly and do everything to make you feel comfortable. Some remarks for us were; no airconditioning in the rooms and a very limited food menu (with no real city center like Ubud there were no neighbouring restaurants dor variation). We did suspect the food wasn’t always very fresh. Nevertheless it was a fine hotel for a couple of nights of relaxation. There are some waterfalls nearby if you want to go on a trip, but not much else to do.","Amazing service and the most relaxing, unplugged atmosphere. Excellent food and spa treatments too. We spent 2 nights there but it felt longer since the pace is so relaxed and enjoyable","Pros: Beautiful scenery and location, amongst green rice fields and views of mountains. Individual bungalows with balconies equipped with table and chairs. Good place to relax and feel in touch with nature. Restaurant served a good variety of options, food was tasty although slightly expensive. Would have liked more options for breakfast. Option available to hire a scooter for a reasonable price. Lovely look-out tower where you can relax.
Cons: the toilet in the bungalow smelt of sewage and was very unclean, bungalow overall could have been cleaner, the shower water annoyingly alternated between very hot and cold without staying on the same temperature. I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you're not keen on insects, as lots of flies, geckos, lizards, frogs at night, sometimes in your room!
Not suitable to walk into town as often encounter menacing dogs along the way. Would have been nice if they had a free shuttle bus into town.
Beautiful location but expensive hotel and overall we were not impressed by the standard of the hotel and did not feel it was good value for money.",Wonderful hotel and very friendly staff. Bungalows are beautiful and super clean. The pool area is just perfect and more than relaxed. I would highly recommend this place! Make sure to check out their trips and spa (we did the local adventure buggy tour and it was so much fun!) and if you can rent a scooter to explore munduk the local way :)

Food here is excellent! Fresh, high quality ingredients. The fries are made from freshly cut potatoes which is rare nowadays. I had the burger and mango pudding. My girlfriend had the mixed salad with chicken and the Dark chocolate mousse. One of the best meals we had over our month long trip.  Although expensive by Balinese standards it's totally worth it.",Great home cooked Asian and Western meals. Definitely the best choice in the area for food. A great plus is the ambiance of the restaurant and the great mountain views. Friendly staff as well. It is part of Sanak Retreat Bali,,,
