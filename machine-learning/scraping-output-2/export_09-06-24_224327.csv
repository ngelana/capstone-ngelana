Service is a bit laggy, we ordered bbq package, but the rice came long after they grilled the fish and sausages, so they were already cold.
The stairs were too steep and the size doesn't suit us, asian and elderly 🥲
Also I think we could use some lighting for dinner, because there were no lighting at all for us to see what we eat, a bit risky to eat fish without lighting, so we use our phone instead. Maybe portable lamps could be considered.","An ok place if you want to sneak away from the city hustle. I love the ambiance (especially when the sun is set and while its raining), I also appreciate the staff services.

There were flies but it’s pretty common if you spent the day in Kintamani.
We stayed for two nights.

If you stayed at Lake Garden, I suggest you to take a sunrise viewing from mount Batur, takes less than 30 mins from the hotel.

Unfortunately there was construction next to the hotel (which was in front of my room). So I can’t really enjoy the view.

Also it is unfortunate that they took a while to deliver the breakfast, while we were kind of in hurry..

The water is not that hot (but rather quite warm).

There was also some stain on the bed sheet, but the staff immediately changes it soon after we mentioned.

They have bond fire at night. Its great to keep the body warm ✨","Pros
Good View of the Lake and Mountain in the afternoon

Cons
- Road access to this villa is under-maintenance (very hard for a car to drive on, especially at night)
- Under maintenance, the jacuzzi is not that warm, the pool appears to be dirty
- The room itself is very small, probably more suitable for backpack travelers
- The sides bed is very sharp and i got bruises when i accidentally walk over
- Aircon is not cold
- Toilet is super small
- U cannot put your shoe outside of the room as they say stray dogs/cats will come which is super annoying
- Lack of Power Supplies inside the room
- The breakfast is limited and initially i ask them to put on the table and chair outside of the room, although it is fully covered, but i feel so gross when i see the amount of flies around it
- My main breakfast was eaten by a cat without my knowing

If u want a nice instagram pictures, u can come to here but overall i dont think it is worth a stay.","As always Kintamani views very perfect & The area was clean enough, jacuzzi & infinity pool is the best spot for chill & taking photo

For food's not bad for Kintamani size, and some fly is always came at the morning & afternoon (its a normal day in kintamani)

Chill 🥂","This place has the potential to be a really nice place, but falls short in so many ways.

Do not be fooled by the pretty instagram/tiktok videos you see of this place. Those influencers care more about likes rather than post the reality.

The door to the room does not shut properly, and there is a gap between the glass wall and the door. This lets in a lot of insects and heat.

Kintamani has a lot of flies, so be prepared for that. The staff try their best to reduce the amount, but there is still a lot of dead flies in the room on check in that could have been cleaned up before we arrived.

The food is ok, but not much choices.

Room is very barren. No TV, but the view is beautiful, so watch that instead. Wifi is unusable, I ended up using my 4G instead.

All in all, its a nice place if you care about IG likes and want to take pretty pictures, but one night is more than enough."

The lake view was stunning, but at the time my stay there was construction going on, so wasn't feel comfortable to open up the curtain. The morning sun was creating green house to the room, it was warm throughout the day. Aircon not as good, the room overall star rating just like 2 star hotel. Bed sheet have yellow spots and not clean. At the time my arival was late, the bathroom light was poor, I manage to swap the light bulb with the room light bulb. Apparently it was 3 watt light bulb, my family was kinda scare because of poor lighting. The water quality was poor. The room doesn't have TV, room small in size, there was no cup to make a cup of tea or coffee. No access to public transport as well. Make sure you have own transport to be here.
My supposedly stay for 2 nights was cut short to 1 night due to limitation and inconvenience experienced. Unable to get refund due to my dissatisfaction on my visit. Please check on the other low star review where I found relevant to my review. Insta story for this accommodation as per view, but experienced not as great. Flies around whe  the door was open, it was advised by the staff to close the door all the time.","Best place to go, clean and comfy, the view was extremely beautiful, no noise at all just 100% relax vibes, the food was also good, very recomended for vacation","The room itself was fantastic and the view was frankly stunning, the breakfast that was served was also very nice. The bathroom and the AC left a bit to be desired though, the AC was definitely the milder of the problems as it would creak in some positions during swing mode. The bathroom however was not great, there was no warm water and the overhead showerhead didn't evenly distribute water at all, it also got very warm in there when it got direct sunlight, it was like a greenhouse. So considering that I'd say Cozy Bali is a great place to stay one or maybe two nights and then move on to a different place.","amazing experience here!!
staff were polite, vibe was cool with abang mountain view, rooms clean and there is air conditioning. bathroom also clean. overall 10/10. and last things is price is so good, its over my expectation.","Made for Instagram. Pretty huts and area, however, our (eventually very short) stay was beset by problems.

Arrived late at night, host waited up and showed us our hut. Unfortunately, the aircon for my room did not really work, cutting out every 10-15 minutes or so, requiring a reset of the power switch outside at the back of the hut to restart. There was apparently no other hut that we could move to, as they were fully booked.

The huts have no windows for ventilation. Still, we did not want to leave the doors open/unlocked, and were also too tired.. eventually we did all fall asleep anyway. Come morning, the room heated up quickly due to all the glass. It was hard to decide whether we wanted a cooler room with flies, or a sauna without. We had been due to move to a more 'premium' hut right by the lake anyway, but my companion observed the occupants of one of those huts appearing to have had similar aircon issues. Via text, the host (who was not onsite in the morning) said we would be moved in a few more hours' time, after the current 'premium' hut guests had checked out.

Besides the aircon, our shower heater also did not work. The room, beddings in particular, were also not well-cleaned. It didn't affect me too much, but caused my companion's dust allergies to act up.

We had another two more nights booked at the accommodation, but given all the issues, I decided that it would be better for us to find alternative accommodation. We had paid for 50% of a planned 3 nights as a booking fee, and eventually stayed less than 12 hours in the lower priced room. I informed the host of our decision to check out; he said that as this was their mistake, I did not have to pay the balance. He declined to provide a refund.

One more thing to note abt the location, it is quite remote. There is no Grab or Gojek service for either transport or food."

Very calm and relaxing place too. You can either just bathe for 50k per person, or take a package including a towel and juice for 100k. There are two basic squatting toilets and two dressing rooms. There was only one local family when we got here, and after they left we had both pools to ourselves. The only reason I took off a star is because the restaurant area was swarming with flies. This is an issue for most places by the lake these days.","Absolutely fantastic place! Beautiful scenery, lovely family/owners, and soon to offer very modern accommodations.  This place is a gem!  The hot springs are just right and plenty of room for friends.  Unlike the other places, Segara Healing isn't crowded, not ptetentious, and very relaxing. Your visit even includes a juice! I'm looking forward to going back in a few weeks.

I can totally recommend to come and take a bath in the hot water pools, it is so relaxing and calm there. The owners are perfectly nice, the food is good and the price is good as well. My family spent a whole afternoon here and we are happy that we found this secret spot!","Photos of houses were taken a long time ago and do not reflect reality. It's damp inside and everything is in poor condition. There is often mold on the ceiling. The fire pit, lawn and view are beautiful. What can't be said about houses🥲The staff is friendly and helpful, we got our money back for the second night"

Campfire was the best! Breakfast selection could be improved though - had a hard time eating it. Just the flies... Really struggled to eat breakfast with hundreds of flies swarming around us. But it's not the place's fault 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻","A really beautiful place right on the edge of the lake. Tents on stilts with bamboo roofs. Everything very clean, meadow kept like on a golf course. Very quiet, campfires in the evenings. Guided tours offered. Friendly, helpful staff. Be warned that there can be l lot of flies there, especially in the wet season. There is a sign for the place at the main road, yet it is not so easy to find at the end of some dirt roads.","The best view points by the lake. You can easily get food and groceries from the close by village too. The camp is beautiful and well managed. The staff were nice and supportive. The unpaved path in the last half mile to get to the camp was a bit challenging even with a motorbike. The flies and mosquitos are part of the wild natural by the lake. If you hate them, you should choose a hotel instead of a camp.","The definition of don't judge a book by its cover. In this case, the cover would be its entrance road. We were welcomed by a narrow bumpy road before we park our car in a parking lot around 20 meters to the camp. You'll need to walk around 2 minutes. I was a bit skeptical at first. But once I entered the camp area,  I was in love at the first sight! It's beautifully mown golf grass field with a breathtaking background of the lake and mountain.

The owner seems to try to keep the camp not overly popular so that the guests would feel at home when they stay here - which we did.

Tent was a bit smaller than the regular glamping camp we used to stayed in. Bed was comfortable. Breakfast was good. Staff and owner were really friendly!

Would really love to come back!","The place is beautiful, facing the lake and mountain.
+ view
+ grass
+ firebond
+ water lilies on the lake with fish pond
+ outside open shower
+ great value for price

- the admin is not friendly and fast response
- not suitable for family coming with stroller
- no sign to give direction on the broken road
- staff is slow in most inquiries"

Excellent quality service, the boys were very friendly and communicative. Our tent was clean and organized. Breakfast is delicious. The only drawback is that there is no cover to reduce the heat inside the tents when the sun is hot, which makes it difficult to come inside or leave it open due to mosquitoes. The bathroom was very clean, with the option to choose between a hot and cold shower.","A very nice place to enjoy nature. Camping vibes with hotel facility. Well, not as clean as hotel, because there are a lot of flies and spider web around Kintamni area. The flies will dissapear at night, and will be back in the day.

The glamping is very quiet at night which I really like because they dont have many units for now. So it will be less people less noise when you stay there. The interior is so comfy eventhough there are spider webs in some spots, but hey, we live in nature. The price is also affordable.

The vibes at night and in the morning is priceless! Don't forget to bring some foods, because there is no foods around the glamping. Breakfast is included in the package, but bring some extra snacks to enjoy with bonfire at night would be perfect.

The downside is the entrance is still not clear. The road has not added yet om google maps. So we need to contact the staff to guide the way to get there. The staff is very friendly and helpful.","The tents, the garden and also the kitchen is very, very dirty, they didnt clean anything. The breakfast was in a plastic box and cold.
