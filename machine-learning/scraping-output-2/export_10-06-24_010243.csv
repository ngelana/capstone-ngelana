I ordered Rujak Kuah Pindang GULA, but when it was coming they gave me ""rujak kuah pindang"" with no sweet taste, it was just salty. When I complained, the waiter just simply said it already contained sugar. The lines were too long, I was waiting around 30 minutes to get the order. The tax is 10%. Luckily, the ambience was nice (downstair seats). I don't really recommend this place to eat rujak. Maybe that day wasn't my good day. The rest was just so so.","There were so many tempting menu choices that my sister and I were crazy about making orders which we ended up trying little by little.
So overall was good at very affordable prices but the most I like was Chicken Sate Lilit and Sayur Gonda and Es Daluman with Palm Sugar)))","I bought Tipat Kuah Ayam WDS and it taste good even though it bit salty for me,
I like the Es Kolak tho","Always excellent, nasi ayam betutu has smokey flavour and taste delicious, bubut campur is the favourite dessert dish is creamy and not too sweet, service is spotless and the staff helpfull, Good Job WDS","Very comfort and estethic place  for  breakfast lunch dinner  and also  for ngerujak  with  friends or family ,  quickly serve and i like all food in WDS,
really recomended , love WDS"

Such as a cozy place and good place to dine in. The bread so various and taste good. Fresh from the oven. But dunno about the halal. They didn't put the Halal sign (Or... Did I miss something?). But I know Conato isn't only in Bali so... I assume it's Halal? Or better put the halal sign so you can attract more visitors.
But a little advice, set the Air Conditioner cooler so I'll stay longer üòãüòãüòã
After all.
I love eat in this place alone!
Recommended","The design of the building resembles a cafe as if to emphasize that this place not only sells bread ... but also can be a choice of places to enjoy coffee and other snacks. a large enough parking lot (fit around 2-3 cars of 5 passengers) on the edge of the A. yani road which is indeed crowded. In essence, this place is good enough for bread shopping or hang out and eat right on the spot, because the place is quite comfortable as well.","Nice place to go for a bakery.

The place feels warm and d best part, it is clean. The bread counters are also cleaned every few hours. Staff are also friendly and attentive.

And if u are slightly hungrier, there is an option to buy the burgers and sandwiches too. We did buy them and received an unexpected order. Ordered a chicken burger and pulled beef sandwich BUT didnt get what we thought it was.

D chicken burger was actually Chicken Ham burger, not a patty.. so it was already a let down from the start. Next our pulled beef sandwich is supposedly from the term, ""pulled beef"". BUT we received a Big Piece of Salami type of sandwich.

Duno who to blame, d management who chose d ingredients OR d staff who may have actually pulled a fast one. So ya, we didnt really enjoy our food, so be careful wen u do order yours.

Nonetheless, d breads sold at d bakery tasted as how it is supposed to.. yummmmyyyy!!

So ya, have a great munch!!

Cheers!!
