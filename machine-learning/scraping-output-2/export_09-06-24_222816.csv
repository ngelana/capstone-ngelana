Great view and clean. Managed by the local community, one of them Mr. Ketut who was very informative. Parking area for car bout 800meters away from the site so you will either have to walk or get local ojek ( motorbike taxi ). IDR 10K for ticket and additional IDR 30k for tubing activity ( including safety vest, helmet, elbow and knee protector) .","A great spot for tubing, walking etc. Super clean, great views to rice fields and sea beyond. Charming spot if your in the area visiting other attractions... wouldn't make the visit if it was the only destination though.","Refreshing and adventurous!!
