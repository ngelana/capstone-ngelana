Food and service were excellent. Prices are really affordable. We did the short ricefield walk to the nearby river after having lunch which was amazing. Crystal clear water and you can have a dip in the refreshing water. Absolutely highly recommended. We will be back for sure.,"Wonderful little spot with breathtaking views on Mount Agung, ricefields and even the ocean. The super friendly local guys who run the place, will happily take you for a walk through the rice fields and down to the river. When you get back a cold beer and a home cooked, local meal is waiting and appreciated greatly.

Great place to fly a drone from as there are some nice ricefields in the area.","Went there with some friends and had a really great time with the guys running the place. We did a nice tracking together down to the river and holy spring, its beautiful there. Food was really nice as well and original, young papaya with Balinese spices and chicken. great views over the valley, highly recommended to anyone that wants to see a piece of authentic and unspoiled Bali.",Very beautiful place with very friendly people. You can experience a very gorgeous walk in the rice field with some very interesting explanation about balinese culture. The river side is really gorgeous. And the food we had at the restaurant was really enak!!! Thank for this really nice moment. I will come back there for sure.,Simple and tasty traditional food. Good service and amazing view!
