The villa's where really nice and very clean. I also loved the swimming pool and there is an amazing view on the mountains and rice fields. When you are lucky you can enjoy the prettiest sunrises, with the mountains on the back ground.  The owners are the sweetest people in the world. If there was something going on they took care of it right away. I would love to come back here.","Spacious villa with outdoor sitting area and kitchen. Pool has a great view of ricefields. There's no reception though, so you need to be self-sufficient.",Nice hotel but sadly the road is not safe and we fell from our motor.,Amazing for the price. Loved it💗,Nice and beautiful villa
ChIJoUcsjh4-0i0RC9nYdzCeyEk,Bali Gong Villa,-8.5806228,115.2800854,"Batuan, Sukawati, Gianyar Regency, Bali 80582, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=5316673291117189387,OPERATIONAL,+62 822-4743-3110,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.5,60,,Very beautiful and chill place. Good hygiene besides some insects. Kind people and good room service. There are animals such as dogs and cats.,"I've stayed here with my family for seven days on New 2019 Year. The villas and surrounding areas are amazing, the swimming pool and the garden is great. The personnel is helpful and friendly. We were invited to a free barbecue party on the new year eve, it was pleasant. The villas are built of antique wood, it looks superb, but in some villas the smell is quite specific because of that, i'd advise to choose it carefully.
There are two things that our family didn't quite enjoy: 1) low internet in some areas of the hotel, which is not so difficult to fix by the owners, 2) location of the hotel appeared quite unfavourable for us, at least because we were with 2 small kids and didn't rent any bikes or cars. We were the first time on Bali and our intention was to stay in Ubud to take walks around, however it turned out that it takes around 40 minutes by car to reach the centre of Ubud. The hotel is located in the village Sukawati in the suburbs of Ubud. There is nothing around except for one temple and one restaurant, which offers high prices and not such tasty food",Very nice location! Really paradise garden and very comfortable villas. Breakfast very limited. Ordered banana pancakes and got 3 small pancakes and only one of them had 2 slices of banana in it. And the pancakes are made from a pre-made supermarket mix. Very disappointing for such a fancy place. Also the fresh orange juice wasn't fresh but chemical. How hard is it to make fresh juice in a tropical country???,"Bali Gong Villa is quite new to the Sukawati area. Close to Ubud (about 30 minutes South by car or motorbike,) this charming villa makes a perfect oasis get-a-way.

We stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed the peaceful vibes offered by both the location and the people who work at the property. 3 men are in charge of taking care of the place and they are all very, very humble and gracious. We felt like we were the only people on the lot, even though we heard a neighbor enter the doors once.

Breakfast is included with your stay, and the restaurant is separate from the villa itself. Just a quick minute walk down the entrance path, you actually pass the restaurant as you enter Bali Gong. Batuan Resto provides wonderful meals during your stay so that you do not have to venture very far to get something delicious to eat. Please check my review on Batuan Resto for more information. For breakfast, you are provided options for English, American, Indonesian and Continental style cuisines. Their fruit is absolutely incredible. And the staff members who work at the restaurant are a very, happy crew.

The rooms are large with extended ceilings that rise high above. There are 2 toilets in the bathroom along with a shower and bathtub. More than enough space to get clean. The shower floor is lined with white rocks, feels great to get a small foot massage as you rinse. We have been traveling around Bali for a couple weeks and this was the first hot shower I experienced. Normally, Bali showers are room temperature or only slightly warm.

The pool is an outdoor haven with an infinity feature. You can take a shower outdoors, next to an impressive tree piece that holds the water. Relax on the red bean bags or under the pagoda.

Upon arrival, you will be asked if you would like to check out their art museum. Say YES. You’ll get to know the men on property and you will also have a chance to explore the intricate marble and wood carvings.

They are flexible with check in and flexible with checkout times. Plenty of parking spaces.
They have 2 dogs that like to bark when you enter the property gates, but they will not bite so do not worry.

Air conditioned rooms with a high ceiling fan keeps the comfort at a maximum.
We paid with cash, it was around 500,000 rp for a night.","It is not a bar or a restaurant but a home stay. We came from an adjacent home stay to use their pool. For 50K you get to use their very nice pool, get a towel and a good cup of coffee. It does not appear to be generally open to the public so coordinate ahead."

Bu Eka doesn’t use onion, garlic yet the taste is very rich and humble at the same time.

They also sell diverse vegan snacks, and stuff.

Please do visit if u’re in the area!","Name has changed apparently but there is still a vegetarian place here. Food was average for local veg nasi campur. Not bad at all. Unfortunately, with no prices on the menu, they can charge whatever they please. Having eaten at a bunch of Balinese veg places, this was one of the most expensive. Significantly more than what we normally pay for a similar meal.","The food tasted really well, found the best vegetarian option in Ubud; also visited the place twice no disappointment. We were impressed by the courteousness of the chef, we just arrived during their closing time but she didn't hesitate to open it all again and welcomed us with the open hands and prepared the dishes fast too and the food was delicious. This made us visit the 2nd time 🙂, and we both were happy seeing each other and the food tasted delicious like before.",The best vegan dish I tasted! We ordered Nasi Campur. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Highly recommended!","The place look oke .but bit old. no wonder because the family from the owner are stay on the side . but diring time some of the colektion are not maintanance by proper way.
i fell sorry is not enough kapasity from the family to make a better place for all those arts.
because i saw some of the colektion are high value painting but old.
hope fully some body will take care more than just clean the floor but have to love too all painting. and know about the wood frame.
any way some of expensive value paint is still there.",Biasa aja. Nothing special in this place.

They have a variety of neat seating arrangements including little bungalow huts.

Deep fried calamari rings were dipped in coconut and served with sweet chili aoli.
Chicken steak was served with a good amount of vegetables including corn on the cob.
Well balanced Soto Ayam soup, comes with rice, sambal and kecap manis. (chili sauce and sweet soy sauce.)

Their gado gado was a feast. Delicious boiled vegetables topped with a peanut sauce that was not over powering in peanuts.

I was surprised that their crinkle cut fries were actually cut with a crinkle knife. Not from frozen, pre-cut fries. These were fresh and delicious.

Nice, chilled red wine. Not too heavy. Perfectly summery.
Lovely music played in the background. All the servers were so friendly.

Our bill came out to around 450,000 rp.
Credit cards accepted.

This place has a beautiful stage with wood carvings in the background.
It seems like a great place to have a banquet for a wedding reception.","Great food, a bit pricey but amazing food great place.",Verry nice place to stop for lunch.
