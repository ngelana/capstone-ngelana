Nice hotel with good restaurant facility and swimming pool. Though the reception guys forgot to keep ready our packet breakfast at 6.30 am for Nusa Penida tour and we were late for 20 minutes, but still I am happy with their service and smile.","Although the hotel condition isn't as good as it rated (4 stars) but I must say that this hotel have a great services. I did writing a comment about the smells in the room and they make sure everyday after cleaning the room, the air conditioner is ON, so the smells gone. Another one that I commenting is the lighting that was very dark when I came for the first time and immediately they change it and even offer me to upgrade the room for free as their services for my inconvenient. Lastly, I did commenting on the towel given that is as the same as a doormat color, and the day after they making sure the towel given is cleaner than before.

Overall I did dissapointed at my first impression but I can't lie that the hotel services is very good. Thank you for all the helpful staffs :)","was told that this is 4 star.    but it failed my expectation,
the list of my disappointment goes on ( i hope my business partner quests dont  experienced like i did ).
PS :we booked 12 rooms  into total actually
#1, the  towel condition given ,not different from door mat.
#2 the bathroom drainage was clogged
# 3 the smell of air con unpleasant
# 4. the room lighting very dark
#5. the most horrifying  fact that we found,,  ""yellow gold"" wasnt flushed at all   ( in our  room 320 toilet. at the 20th march 2024 time 10 pm)

I REGRET THAT i must stay another 2 nites more in here until check out time  nxt saturday ,,,,, dont want my bali trip ruined. because  we choose this hotel.  pls take this review to upgrade , dont take it as complain ,, but u guys should really  fix this",Useless place. No proper WiFi. Rooms are so small. Service is bad. Served non veg food when specifically asked for veg food. Location is neither near to beach nor to airport. So overall totally useless hotel,"Amazing hotel, near everywhere especially if yall use vehicle, only 8-10 minutes to kuta"

1. The locality of this hotel is too good, you will get to see Mandara Bridge and Garuda Statue

4. Very helpful and friendly staff.",Bay suite room is very nice. Very clean. My only small complaint is the size of the TV in the room. It's too small however that's not enough to detract from what is a very friendly clean and well presented hotel,"I stayed from 27 April to 4 May. I stayed in the bay Suite. The room was OK. The view isnt great but the room is OK. The location of the hotel means there is not much anywhere close so everything is a Gojek ride. Breakfast was really terrible to say the least .
I had booked directly with the hotel from 11th May to 19th May and prepaid. I decided to cancel and stay elsewhere as I felt the hotel simply wasnt where I wanted to be. Initially the hotel agreed to refund by Whatsapp. When I questioned the hotel today I received the following even though their policy is very clear on their booking that bookings cancelled within 7 days of stay are 100% refundable""
Today I received the following from the hotel.
""your refund case, still under discussion with our corporate management and will update by the latest monday, 13 May 2024""
I have reported this as a fraudulent transaction to my bank and warn anyone booking here to buyer beware","Some of the main problems I faced when staying as a couple during my honeymoon are Small room, bad room design (toilet in same room), a strict limit on drinking water (1L drinking water a day per guest is ridiculous for a hotel situated in a tropical climate).

There was no coolbox, then they try to explane that they didn't have coolbox for all the rooms.
But the I told them to go buy one, we had order a room with coolbox.
Then they find a coolbox.
But wifi didn't work at all, not even the internet on the cellphone could not get a okay signal, so I had to rent an office in city to work.
The last 8 days we got moved to a room with balcony to the street, very noisy. We got moved because toiletwater come fown from the room on top of our apartment.
The shower didn't work, but the didn't want to fix it either.
We stay there 3 weeks, because the pool was nice, the staff was friendly and really try to help and I had to rent an office for 4 weeks in town.
Beware of that every sunday there is a rock concert from a church located in reception,  that begin 7 a clock in the morning for open doors.","Their breakfast is delicious.

The staffs especially the villa receptionist was a girl, full of spirit, friendly, and her smile is contagious! She explained the details of our accomodation, our rooms, when the restaurants are open and how to act during Nyepi.

The room is quite spacious, bed is comfortable, bedside lamps are all working, and curtains are certainly helping during Nyepi. In the kitchen we were provided with stoves, pans and pots and utensils enough to cook simple items.

The pool is around 1.4 meters deep, very clean, you can also ask for the cleaning service to clean your pool starting from 9 A.M. The staffs are very quick with dealing your needs.

The restaurant provides amazing buffet, they also provide certain menus and can directly deliver food to your room! You can also choose to eat at the restaurant. For a villa this fancy, the food and beverages price isn't that high which is quite surprising.

I'll be sure to come back here again if I have the chance to visit Bali again :) kudos!",They have 3 pools here to enjoy.. the place is nice just not a luxurios feeling for the room.. but overall you still can enjoy other facilities and nice view right here.,"Most amazing experience in Bali, the honeymoon villa is breathtaking!! absolutely perfect","The villas are well maintained, neat & clean.

There were no people behind the bar either. So I was running around the room looking for a place to spit the bacon.
Funny and unpleasant.

They have 2 floors, and I see a lot of people bring laptop and work. I have no chance to see the 2nd floor but I think it will be similar with 1st and 2nd floor should have more tablesüòÅ

I order single origin Bali Kintamani (full wash) with V60 method (hot). My husband order soursoup juice. We also order Pastel (3pcs/ plate). The price is ok. Its taste also ok.

I stayed for 3 nights and quite enjoyed the place especially my room everyday whenever my business time was over. I was very satisfied with the lodging considering the very affordable price compared to others. Tree House had public pool, kitchen, and nice wooden rooms that beautifully stacked with each other, symbolizing the togetherness of the Balinese people.

The service was top-notch! Kudos to Mbok Icha as the manager that welcomed me very warmly even though I checked in late at midnight due to my plane agenda. She explained me thoroughly about the service and was ready for any complaints I might have. At my first room, I found out late at the second morning that my door couldn't be locked. Mbok Icha responded very helpfully and moved me quickly to another room.

The bedroom and bathroom were quite spacious and furnished with standard facilities. I got a comfortable double bed and a nice set of working desk. While the AC took a little longer to cool the room, it set the room at the right temperature in the end. The first room had quite everything I need, but the second lacked adequate cupboard for my clothes. The way to the room was a little far from the front door, but it pushed me to meet people from another room and it was a great experience.

The location is great as minimarket is near, foods are everywhere, and is accessible by online motorcycle and taxi services. The only critic is it is quite far and steep from the main road if you walked and you could met stray dogs on the way up (I don't really like them) even though they are docile. But again, it gave off the Balinese environment I enjoyed and no problem at all if you majorly take motorcycle or taxi like I did.","Amazing place, sad to have only stayed one night. Very reasonable price for the quality of the rooms. Great coffee and staff too!","Beautiful, and serene with pool.

The weather was sweltering, there were delays at the airport, and to top it off, my suitcase wouldn't open when I finally arrived at this lovely hotel.

A huge thanks to the staff of this charming place for their care. Throughout all my years of traveling, this has been one of the most memorable instances of how management and owners truly make your stay in a foreign country comfortable. Jin helped me contact the Samsonite store, and he even served me breakfast later than usual because I was catching up on sleep after a grueling flight and subsequent problems. I wish there were more people like him in the world. Thank you so much.

Regarding the room:

The room facilities may not be the newest, but the bed is very comfortable with clean sheets and decent pillows. I usually sleep with my own pillow, but I was so exhausted that I didn't taking it out of my suitcase. I didn't have much time to ""live"" in the hotel because the first day was spent dealing with issues, and the second day I slept until almost checkout time.

I want to especially mention the management. It's very challenging to work with people and remain humane, and it's only possible when you truly love what you do.

Here provides airy room that cost is quite economical. The location is not far from Ngurah Rai airport, so once we arrive in Bali we can check in soon and unwind. Homestay artistic Balinese style with ornament ornament original bali and also sculpture statue. I liked the simple but clean and neat room with frangipani flower on every corner. And what is fun for the kids is there is a swimming pool and chairs to relax. Staying here is like feeling the warmth of the family because the atmosphere is very homy and the owner is friendly. Recomended to save the cost of stay during your vacation in Bali."

Loved the food so much and the service from Ms. Nasya is very great. Here also have an amazing view of either the ocean or the traffic, you can choose where to sit. Prices are standard I would say. Would love to come back here someday. Recommended!","Order one Salmon avocado sushi plus one ice cappuccino, plus 21% tax and service total cost 157K, the sushi taste was ok but only have 6 small sushi, which is very expensive, after finish all not get full yet, but don‚Äôt wanna order more since food not worthy, not recommended!
That‚Äôs why I am the only one to have lunch, when I came in another two guests just left without have meals I guess they were scared by the price!","A lovely restaurant with fantastic staff, fab views and AWESOME food!

The servers are gorgeous - so friendly, polite, and professional (Kutu was our favourite).

However, I'm not sure just how familiar they, or even the kitchen staff, are with their own menu (I'm referring specifically to their breakfast options only), as one day you'd get one thing, and the next, it's completely different (albeit the same order).

Saying that, we cannot recommend this place enough!

Their food was fantastic!

We were here for a week so we tried a lot from their menu, including their fish and chips, burger, spring rolls, and even treated ourselves with a dessert - their banana split. Everything on their menu was so tasty and really beautifully presented.

What stood out the most were their sushi rolls. Absolutely outstanding in every way!!

Highly recommended.",Delicious food! We were not staying at the hotel but came here because of they offer japanese food and had a high rating and it is well deserved! We enjoyed every bite and they also offer vegetarian dishes. Service is very professional and lovely. We definitely recommend this place,Reading the review while doing my ordering gave me really mixed feeling. Eventually the food came and guess what I am very impressed by it. Thou I am the only patron during lunch. The service and food staff really gave me their 100% even thou its somewhat their ‚Äúrest‚Äù time. Only downfall is that it‚Äôs not air conditioned that‚Äôs all. But it‚Äôs really okay.

Affordable price, clean and easy to get from main road. And the owner so kind and generous. Even no swimming pool, you may consider this place was best. They provide also hot water and clean bed.
So far this place was great.",Very loud and disturbing because its really close to an elementary school so every morning they always gather and very loud with the loudspeaker. Also the owner‚Äôs family itself is pretty loud because they live there as well. Not too much privacy from the owner for asking a lot of questions way too much than basic administration requirements,"Nice place with great owner, called Pak Budi's family, really friendly and so helpfull.
Clean rooms and have space of green garden. the location was near to nusa dua, GWK, kuta, Jimbaran. So reccomended, just worth it with the price !! Thank you","Easy to find location, only a few meters from the main road, not far from supermarkets. There is a garden.","The owner are so annoying, not recommended and not worth it at all"

Didn't try the food, we were put off after seeing another 'patron'  scurry along the window behind the bar.

However they do have a half decent beer selection and good service. As soon as we walked in they asked what sport we wanted on and even let us use the laptop to look it up ourselves.","Unusual place. We went for an afternoon cocktail and swim but weren‚Äôt allowed in the pool until after we‚Äôd eaten. The food took a very long time to come out and they got our order wrong. But the food was quite nice, thanks for having us!",So for Friday night footy it was as hot as anything. No air con. Only beer from the fridge. No other drinks available except soft drinks and told no food. Only one patron some drunk guy at the bar who from the moment we showed up would not shut up.  Only one screen with a re run of English Soccer from 2 years ago. We bailed after 5 minutes and went into Kuta to the Stadium Bar. Unreal.,Great spot for watching your favourite sports. TVs along the length of the bar wall. Food is good - hotdogs and burgers plus local favorites. Beer is cold. Pool table and a swimming pool with beanbag loungers. Located inside Mahogany hotel. Basement parking. Great spot to chill on Sunday. Able to hire out for birthdays as well.,Good for watching nfl on mola. Opens at 7am. Closes 22.
