The driver (Made), arranged by Acala, picked us up and brought us al the way from the airport to the place. The walk from the road through the ricefields is amazing before you arrive at Acala. The cabin was clean and had a good ambience. Waking up with the sounds of nature did us both good and eating tasty breakfast with the amazing view was great. We rented a scooter (through Acala) at to explore the surrounding. The waterfalls were nice and alse the local warrungs served great food. We definitetly recommend to stay here for long time or just for a couple of nights!","It would be an understatement to say anything less than ‚Äúwow‚Äù about this rural oasis in northern Bali.  Set in the middle of a family-run organic farm, are a couple of lovely guest houses, and the nicest hosts, who speak English,German, Indonesian, and probably a couple other languages.  This is the place to get away from it all, while still being taken care of.  The eye-candy alone is stunning.  Learn about agricultural practices in the region, and unwind with an ace- Yoga instructor in a gorgeous Shala.  Plus- these folks are plugged into a great network of guides, drivers etc.. should you want to explore.  Congrats on a beautiful, restful paradise.","Amazing place, location and owners. Stayed 3 nights and didn't want to leave the peace and beauty of being nestled in the rice fields. Sunset from the front and sunrise in the back. Wonderful walk around the property and only 15 minutes scoot to Munduk. I appreciate the eco consciousness of the space with attention to comfort (like hot water and awesome bed/bedding and towels). One of the best breakfasts I've had in Bali too. Highly recommend!","Beautiful guesthouse in the middle of rice fields, deep nature experience in their cute guesthouses. Absolutely yummy food, nice people, good vibes and lovely atmosphere. We loved it here and would always come back.",It‚Äôs paradise in the middle of the Balinese rice fields. I enjoyed my stay here a lot & used this beautiful nature environment to charge my batteries. Time flies & I definitely would come back üôè thank you so much & all the best. Highly recommended.
