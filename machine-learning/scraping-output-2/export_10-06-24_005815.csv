Powdered eggs for the free breakfast, frighteningly filthy kettles used for your coffee or tea, aircon doesn't work, doors don't shut properly so they cigarette smoke from other guests leaks in, only two tiny bottles of water for 2 night stay. No fridge or kettle in room. Lots of little ants in the room, even on the bed.The Balinese people are very nice and always provide kind service so it's hard to give bad reviews, but this one is legit. Look elsewhere.","Utamas Keramas Villa provides a luxurious and tranquil experience. Nestled in a serene location, the villas are spacious and well-appointed. Private pools and open-air living spaces are highlights. The staff is exceptionally attentive, making for a personalized stay. A perfect getaway for those seeking peace and relaxation","I REALLY LOVE THIS PLACE! üëèüèº Even though the location is just a little bit in the middle of nowhere (you would get a high price for food delivery on gojek) but it was worth for a peaceful weekend getaway.

The staff was super helpful and friendly, the room was clean and comfy, the breakfast menu was just right, and the pool was well maintained. The best part was, this is a new building, that's why it was so worth it.

Totally gonna come back to this place every time I visit Gianyar tho üëçüèºü•∞","I'm sorry to make a low review because I do think reviews matter, but I think I'm being generous. We stayed here for 6 days, 5 nights. The they of arrival, we entered the room and there was a faint smell of humidity in the room, nothing crazy but enough not to be comfortable. We bought sandalwood and humidity bags to make the smell disappear and it did. We also saw lot of humidity signs on the room so we couldn't back anything on the wall (as you can see in some pictures). I think that this things make someone not to be comfortable on the room... but that was not all.

The day of arrival we discovered the mirror of the bathroom was not even clean (as you can see in the picture) and the towel hanger was also broken, so the only place you could put the towel was on the hanger of the terrace, which was not comfortable.

But the worst thing, among all of the things, was that in our 5 night stay, they only ""cleaned"" the room once (they changed towels, paper, bottles, trash, and throw the blanket on the bed, because they didn't do the bed). What we couldn't believe was that we had to stay the rest 4 days without any room cleaning service: no towel change, no bed making, no bottles provided, no cleaning paper, no trash empty... it was unbelievable. There was only one trash, in the toilet, and it was FULL from the 2nd day of not cleaning so we had to put all the plastic bottles just around the trash, just there, while the days went on.

Also, we didn't try the pool and kitchen because they were not that clean... so overall, we rejected to choose this stay.

Finally, I have to say that I put 1 star extra to the review because the staff was nice, they were not rude at all and if we asked anything they were very nice and helpful... but just for this reason I can't deny all the other factors that made our stay not very pleasant...

Pros: we only saw some geko and mosquito in our room, nothing else","Staff is very friendly & helpful. But my room feels humid, bathroom walls are flaky, while my friend‚Äôs room is fine. Breakfast got 3 choices of menu, and it tastes good. Small access to the villa, and quite neighborhood. It‚Äôs ok for 1-2 night stays."

The staff have been amazing and everything has been clean. They serve breakfast what is nice and also have a restaurant to grab dinner at. I had a bad situation happen to me last night where I was beaten up by 5 Indonesian men and was robbed and got my motorbike stolen in ubud. The staff here helped me out after I got back from hospital gave me free water and medication to help with the swelling they showed genuine care for my well-being and helped me out a tonne. Amazing place thank u to the team a bunch.,"We stayed in the Bungalow situated within the middle of the rice fields and absolutely enjoyed the great view and relaxed atmosphere of this place.

the staff is amazing, the house and rooms are clean and the food in their warung nearby (they also offer a free shuttle) is absolutely delicious :)

Would definetly recommend to come here :)","Stayed at Lotus House in Keramas with my fiance while on a trip to visit friends and get a few surfs in, Lotus House was excellent. It was a great base to set out for our days and close to the waves we were surfing. The owner Kadek is fantastic and helped us with everything we needed and the staff who he has trained are kind and helpful. His restaurant nearby also had such good food and was a really good place for remote work in the mornings. Coffee with a rice paddy view, can't beat it! Recommend.","The staff are so wonderful. The owner is friendly and takes pride in Lotus. We had everything we needed and the beach is a quick walk through the greenery infront of the place. The rooms were nice, Clean and new. Shower was great too. Their local dog is a gem üíï we stopped over for 1 night while traveling through bali, the guys had fun waves in Keramas too. Also the Waung Legong is a MUST, the food was so so good!! Best campur I've had. (and I live in bali) definitely recommended.","The place are super nice.
We feel great atmosphere here, the owner mr. Kadek super friendly.
The worker service also super friendly.
We have nice room and clean.
And we walk only 5 minutes to Keramas beach.
For sure we will come back!!"

Waiting for one our for fried chicken with didn't have any meat,"The location of the bungalows were in the middle of the green rice fields, with the cool sea breeze and the beautiful view of Mount Agung, could made us to feel the atmosphere of natural peacefulness.
A comfortable bar and restaurant at fairly cheap prices and situated on a high building also made us enjoying to sit and see the scenery over there.
If we're bored, we can swim in the clear water swimming pool or just sit beside it while relaxing..","Barn n bunk is the best place to stay in Bali! The views of beautiful sustainable and organic farm land spread in front of stunning Balinese mountains with the raging ocean to the side are unbeatable.
The food is wonderful, and all of the staff make you feel like part of their family.
I would rather stay here than at 5 star spa resort anytime because the people and environment are authentic, charming, and radiantly alive.","I love this place for sure. The landscape very natural with greenfield of rice around the cafe. You can also find swimming pool here. Its totally free if you wanna get some wet while get your lunch.

Barn N Bunk, available for modern to local food, with good price. sometimes you can see many kites in the sky when kites festival held.

Its not far from Denpasar, around 30-40 minutes by riding. Trust me you should come to relax your mind in Burn N Bunk.","Barn n Bunk is an awesome humble place to stay in Bali. When you think of a budget place, you probably don't think of a superb view, friendly and thorough customer service, and (most importantly) great food offered all at once. But Barn n Bunk didn't compromise with these things. And knowing that their produce stuff came mostly from their own organic garden is simply awesome. They were building a couple of lovely villas while I was there, will definitely come back and try to stay there to experience the luxury version of Barn n Bunk."
