If you're doing the rafting then this is an incredible place to see on your journey. Beautiful views and great surrounding areas!,"You must access this waterfall as part of the rafting tour.  Beautiful scenery, and the waterfall was a great pitstop with restrooms and drinks. Check river water level before you leave to make sure it’s not too high or too low.","The best rafting in experience i have ever had.
The way from the start point till the end is really long enough to enjoy and to take photos.
I would greatly recommend this place","Amazing waterfall near a big the river, we trekked all the way down from the rice fields with the assistance of the local guide which was very appreciated as it is an adventurous hike! Worth it ♥️","Rafting was fun and the boat guide worked hard. However, they made us wait for an hour for other people to join the group. Some boats had two people riding so I dont understand why we had to wait that long."
