Big credit to the guide who tries 1000% of his effort to keep guest always smile and get the best experience. Always makes fun, jokes, and treat us with drinks and snacks. Top experience!! Thank you!!","The view & experience are breathtaking.
Your  experience will depend on the guide with you sadly our guide wasn‚Äôt good in term of attitude , his rafting skills are good however he ruined the experience.
The fact that they are trying to force you to tip is unprofessional.","Guides were good fun. Rock sculpting was an added bonus. Should you have the right taxi driver, can negotiate a good price. Brilliant experience for all. Loved every minute. Dress appropriately. Foot glove ideal. Thank you",A fun experience. Our guide was hilarious. The river was beautiful. The rapids were very very mild and the food afterwards was not great. Be prepared to pay $50 aud if you want photos and video,A 2 hour long rafting which was a blast! It's good for beginner because the ride was not that scary. You'll get a buffet lunch after the 2 hour rafting. Great scenery on the whole ride üòç the rafting guides are fun and of course they will look after you.

We opted for ATV Tandem ride. Our journey was made even more memorable thanks to our fantastic guide, Gede, whose expertise and hospitality added an extra layer of enjoyment to the whole experience.
From the moment we booked our tour, the customer service provided by ATV Tandem Right was exceptional. The staff was friendly, accommodating, and readily answered all our questions, ensuring we felt prepared and excited for our adventure.","A thrilling rafting experience for beginners in Bali. Excellent communication and service from Mr Kebu Made who picked us up from our hotel and dropped us back, with good suggestions for our transfer to Nusa Penida the next day. We booked on a whim on a Friday afternoon for the first time slot on Saturday and Mr Kebu got back to us promptly with good price and great service. We would highly recommend the first (9am) time slot to avoid the rush as we did. Only thing to be aware of is steep trek up & down to the river which has 400+ steps.","It was an wonderful experience.. highly recommend to book through this. We got reasonable price compared to others for both Kuber ATV + Rafting.

Thank you so much",The best aktivities in Ubud,Fabulous activities and great service! Highly recommend!
