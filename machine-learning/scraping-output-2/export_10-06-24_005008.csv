It was really quiet with a really beautiful view of the rice fields. The pool is very big and you can enjoy the rice field while swimming. The room is nice and clean. And the staff is very friendly too. The wifi is also quite fast. This is a nice place if you want to be away from the sound of traffics and to just enjoy the view and sound of birds and ducks.
I'm not a fan of the dark bathroom though. The floor tiles are black, and because my eyesight is not very good, I often trip.
But other than that, it's a nice stay.

You'll find giant sized lizards in the washroom, pool, room and even on the bed.
The living room has only one small white light which is even dimmer than the phone flashlight.
The room is surrounded by plants which was the only good and positive thing in the entire stay.

Would request the staff and owner to please work on the lizards being removed/reduced and the lighting in the room. I'm sure one wouldn't want to sleep with a giant lizard in bed.

My stay at Vinaya Boutique Hotel in Ubud was nothing short of enchanting. Nestled amidst the breathtaking rice fields, the hotel offered a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

The one-bedroom self-contained apartment I stayed in was a sanctuary of comfort and elegance. From the moment I stepped in, I was greeted by stunning views of the lush greenery outside. The harmonious blend of modern amenities and traditional Balinese design created a truly enchanting atmosphere.

What truly set Vinaya Boutique Hotel apart was its exceptional hospitality. The host went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was unforgettable. From personalized recommendations to attentive service, every interaction with the staff was a delight.

And let's talk about the food ‚Äì it was nothing short of spectacular. Each meal was a culinary journey, with flavors that tantalized the taste buds and presentations that were as beautiful as the surrounding landscape. Whether I was indulging in traditional Balinese cuisine or savoring international dishes, every bite was a delight.

Overall, my experience at Vinaya Boutique Hotel was nothing short of magical. From the breathtaking views to the impeccable service, every moment spent there felt like a dream. I cannot wait to return to this oasis of tranquility in the heart of Ubud.","We really liked the hotel. It's new, clean, with amazing design and attention to detail. The service was amazing.

1) you can find very similar (if not identical) statues at the stores in Ubud for a way lower price

2) one of the worker was polishing a wood statue which had already a price label.

Keep this in mind when contracting your price at the store.",They have local wood carvers who are clearly skilled in their craft. The showroom floor is geared to shoppers. An employee will be assigned to you and follow you around hoping to sell you something.,"Gorgeous art- I want it all, but could only purchase what fits in my suitcase home. One of the carved pieces I selected was unstained/unoiled and they asked if I wanted it to match the other piece then oiled it at no extra cost. Very helpful staff and good prices.",You can watch them doing the carving. They will give you a certificate of quality of the wood.,"Werochana wood carving is the best choice for those who are looking for unique and best quality of wood carving. It has vast selections of wood carvings made from high quality of woods such as ebony,mahagony,crocodile wood,hibiscus wood even sandal wood.

They are very kind and hospitable, welcoming us to the family.
The room was spacious and bed very comfortable. The grounds had a swimming pool, social area with snacks and drinks available.They provided a wonderful service where didn't have to move, also organised a tour service for us.
They shared their local knowledge and traditions and were lucky enough to stay on the full moon where were welcomed to the temples for ceremonies.
This area of Bali is really nice with a lot of things to do and see.
I highly recommend thank you so much!","This quiet hotel was in a great place, about a 10 or 15 minute drive from main city of Ubud. They have multiple rooms set away from the busy and loud city but close enough to enjoy both. The hosts Obama and his wife were fantastic and were always happy to help,preparing both me and my friends a lovely breakfast every morning served in an outside dining area next to pool and sun chairs. They had scooters for rent at a very reasonable price, and the price of the room was good value considering what was included. Ive never met some people so nice and such good hosts. Would stay again and recommend to others. I will say this venue is rural, so yes there are bugs around but if this doesnt bother you will love it as much as I did. Unfortunatley I have no pictures. The local area is great with good cheap restaurant with great food. And plenty of traditional balinese temple and not far from main attractions of Ubud.","Friendly owner, has small snack shop, but need to check the Expiry date in the items. Quite small pool, and the location is inside the owner house. So you can experience balinese life, but bit less privacy.

2 stairs building with max 4 persons each room. Can request for simple cooking stuff if you want to cook by yourself","I Visited Bali in September 2017 and was impressed by sense of Humor, dedication, knowledge about his culture etc of Mr Obama. The best way to know Bali in a proper way is stay few days in nice Homestays and the wise ones choose Mr Obama Homestay because it is nearly in perfection.",The staff were amazing and so attentive. Lovely rooms and swimming pool!

The staff makes sure you get everything but gives you utmost privacy. Do not miss out on this one.,"Really totally located right in the middle of a paddy field, Very relaxing. Better to have your own car to explore Ubud. Oh they also have meals you can order and recommended."

The host is gracious and kind and went out of his way to accommodate my needs while staying. The room, though on the smaller side, is comfortable and beautifullly apportioned. The host arranged for my rental of a brand new motorbike and had great tips for exploring the area. Breakfast was generous and delicious. An issue arose with another guest who was behaving in a disruptive manner over a long period, and the host handled it with competence and professionalism. He did not hesitate to incur some costs, in handling this incident, to make sure we felt comfortable and secure.","Very good experience !
