The standout feature here is undoubtedly the taste of their noodles and fried rice, both of which are incredibly flavorful. The richness of the flavors in these dishes is a testament to the culinary expertise of the chefs. Moreover, the portions are generous, ensuring you leave with a satisfied appetite.

One of the pleasant surprises was the affordability of the meals. Considering the quality and quantity of food you receive, the prices are quite reasonable. It's a great spot for those looking for hearty, delicious meals without breaking the bank.

The staff and the owner of Depot Lucas are exceptionally kind and welcoming. Their friendly demeanor and attentiveness enhance the overall dining experience. They are always ready to offer recommendations and ensure that you have a comfortable time during your visit.

One thing to note is that Depot Lucas is a popular spot, and it's not uncommon for it to be crowded. This is a testament to its popularity among locals and visitors alike. While it might require a bit of patience to secure a table during peak hours, the wait is undoubtedly worth it for the delectable dishes you're about to enjoy.

In summary, Depot Lucas is a culinary treasure offering rich, flavorful noodles and fried rice with generous portions at reasonable prices. The friendly staff and owner create a warm and welcoming atmosphere, making it a must-visit dining destination. Just be prepared for some crowds, especially during busy meal times, but don't let that deter you from experiencing the delightful flavors that Depot Lucas has to offer.","This is a place that you should visit if you're craving for pork noodles and fried rice, it tastes good and the portions are quite big. Even though the place is quite small and might be a little hard to find, so you need to careffully look at its sign. The noodles and the fried rice were great in my opinion. The noodles are thick and have a great chewiness, and the soup was quite good too, I added a dash of sesame oil and it was amazing. I love the fried rice since it was neither too dry nor too greasy, and also it tasted great. The only downside is the environment of the place, since it's small and may looked that it had a bad sanitation. But that wouldn't be a prolem since I came here for the food, not to enjoy the place.","...location : a little bit ""hidden"", and simple warung ; menu : only fried rice and noodle ; the taste : not bad but yummy, with sweet pork slices, big portion...üò¨ ; Price : affordable...","Renowned for its large portion, one dish equals to 3 persons","I'd hv given it 5 star, if it weren't for the location and place that's almost torn down. In brief, awesome taste, generous amount of chasio and noodles cooked al dente. reasonable price 28k for that huge portion of pork noodle. On the downside, this tiny place is packed so expect  a looooong wait. You'll see ppl quieing for take aways and online food delivery drivers joining the queue. Not many opt to dine in, the shophouse is dirty, uninviting, and hot! No aircon and located right by the main road giving it tons of dust. Na-ah. No parking space available for cars so it's a hassle. If you're in the vicinity, go for it, otherwise, save yourself and go to a better food stall."
