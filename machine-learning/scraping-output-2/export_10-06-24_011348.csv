Food is very good, portions big and prices very decent.
A good spot to fuel up you energy before further exploring.","Excellent point to rest after a long bike ride. We left the bike here and hiked for 15 minutes.

Prices ar super affordable and the family owning the Warung is very nice!

There‚Äôs also gas to buy :)","Food was fresh, only downside is we got a lot of ants in it... Like a whole bunch. The other people who ate there didnt notice, but both of us got loads of them.

Price was ok, but better to eat some where else. Can buy beer and cold water from here aswell before banah Cliff and beachüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôè","Fresh Made food and juices   and good prices.
I recommend it.",Some small shop
