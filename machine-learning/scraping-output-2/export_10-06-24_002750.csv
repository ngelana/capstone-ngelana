Karangasem, Kabupaten Karangasem, Bali 80811, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=8414608650703421159,OPERATIONAL,+62 811-389-481,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.6,115,,"Villa Agung is nothing short of astounding. Two showers, a tub with excellent ocean view, and a private pool. The construction is very thematic, all wooden teak and bamboo. The bed has a gorgeous framed view of Mount Agung, when the clouds permit viewing.

When we arrived, the tub invited us to cool off and soak with thousands of colorful flowers. The provided incense in a pair of bamboo leaf offering plates beautifully amended the scene.

The construction is fairly open which lets in the roar of pounding surf. I recommend earplugs if that will bother you. The structure is too breathable to permit full air conditioning, but it is naturally cool-ish even during the hot November weather. There is a portable air conditioner which can cool the inside of the bed's mosquito net, somewhat.

The campus is fairly large and nice to explore. I preferred to take dinner in the large common area, but you can also dine in your villa.

The location is not too far from nearby Candidasa, Tenganan village, and two water palaces. However a sign at the beginning of the dirt road forbids online taxi pickup. They prefer you to overpay for local taxi service.

Massages were priced in the upper range, but were so nice (and conveniently on-location) that I did not mind.","Incredible resort. We stayed in villa agung and the views did not disappoint. It was excellent for our honeymoon. If we return we probably would go to the honeymoon suite for price ab’s maybe a bit more privacy but the agung suite was also incredible. The resort was quiet but a large campus with a beautiful pond in the middle. Nice to walk the local road, see the rice fields. The service was amazing! As well as the food. My only complaints are the lack of walk ability and the decks on agung didn’t seem safe.",The villas are amazing and the staff is excellent. It’s definitely not in a tourist area and the closest white sand beach is about a 15 minute drive but the villas can provide a driver to get you anywhere on the island (for a fee).,"The place is exceptional, authentic, warm, decorated with great taste. You feel at home from the first seconds. The staff is unbelievably kind and attentive. The food is very refined and if you want to offer yourself a moment of relaxation and flavors, try the banana cocktail.
We extended our stay, after having toured the island we found no equal to this paradise on earth.

We had the chance to meet the owners who are 2 people as exceptional as their place. Knowing the history of this place made it even more unique to us.

Thank you again, we will miss you, but count on us to come back very soon!",I think this villa is the most beautiful one in Jasri and probably around the eastern coast of Bali. It’s truly a beachfront sanctuary with Mount Agung as the backdrop. The place is so serene with clear river water running through it. The architecture and interior design are a blend of Indonesian Minang culture with Balinese. It’s rustic yet beautiful. All of my senses were spoiled when I visited this place. This villa is an art masterpiece and it’s just stunning. Highly recommend!

Andre is wonderful company during the provided (and fantastic) breakfasts (best cortado in SE Asia!) and for dinners should you choose to dine here (not included but oh so highly recommended!) meals are served in his main home which is nothing short of spectacular and an excellent value.","For those seeking a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of Bali's touristy south shore, Hidden Heaven Rumah Barong is a true gem. Nestled in a serene and breathtakingly beautiful location, this secluded paradise is the perfect escape from the crowds and chaos of everyday life.

André, our host, made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived. His warmth and hospitality were genuine, and we felt as though we were staying with an old friend rather than a host we had just met. André's passion for cooking is evident in every meal he prepared for us, and we were blown away by the care and attention to detail he put into each dish.

But perhaps the most memorable aspect of our stay was the stunning natural beauty that surrounded us. The quiet and secluded beach was just steps away, and we enjoyed leisurely walks with our dogs while taking in the breathtaking scenery. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore and the cool ocean breeze were a welcome respite from the stresses of everyday life.

All in all, our stay at Hidden Heaven Rumah Barong was truly unforgettable. André's warm hospitality, combined with the natural beauty of the location, made for the perfect escape. We can't wait to return and experience André's delightful cooking, engaging stories, and warm hospitality once again.","If I visit Bali again someday, it will be worthwhile and happy to just stay here. Peaceful, quiet, beautiful place.","Hidden Heaven is a dreamy place for a time out in paradise. I was warmly welcomed by André, the owner, and given a tour of the magical property. The entire stay feels like a visit to a friend. If you are lucky, André is also available as a private chef. The private bungalow has everything you need and is beautifully maintained. The ideal day starts with a stunning sunrise on the nearby beach, followed by an included breakfast at Andre's and continues with a visit to magical Virgin Beach (about 12 minutes by scooter). I am delighted and I will definitely come back!","My partner and I stayed for a night at this amazing place. A fabulous separate cottage , sitting in the corner of an elegant botanical quality garden setting complete with a salt water pool. The sounds of waves breaking onto the beach and the ever present bird life fill the air. Our host , Andre , a well travelled man, full of interesting stories and a master cook completed this perfect getaway. Highly recommended."
