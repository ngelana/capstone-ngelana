Dinner can get insane.

The ribs are lovely and the meat just melts off the bone. The sauce to compliment is sweet and tangy.

The burgers are monstrous - you have been warned!

The satay skewers are also worth a go.

Service is reasonable yet when busy it can be a bit lacklustre.

The restaurant is fairly clean for it being a bit by the side of the road.

Enjoy!","It was one of my worst experiences for dining in Bali.
Wait was crazy and when it is our turn to be seated, what we were informed that there was no more food.
Why did the restaurant not inform their customers and instead make them queue like crazy?

Going over the menu, we asked what was available, and the only item was its pork loin. Leaving with no other choice, we ordered 7 pcs at 70K each. And they assure us there was no more pork ribs.
But what astonished us was those who were seated later than us was served the last remaining pork ribs.

The restaurant totally disregarded customers who came first.

Taste of pork loin was too salty.

Whole experience felt way over price and zero service.","Yumm.... tender and big size ribs, well seasoned & fresh veggies. The ribs were not spicy, so kids could enjoy it too, spicy and other sauce provided separately. Crowded and queueing during meal times. Please  put more smiles on your beautiful faces please..üòâ",A must do bbq dining experience when visiting the Ubud area! Service is non existent but done in style üòú the menu is simple and it‚Äôs a meat lovers paradise!

Cheers,"Good, affordable option for some roadside barbecue. Flavour of the meat and side dishes was as expected.

The fried bananas really were something else though so would advise leaving some space to fit these in."

Nice property with good facilities and breakfast spread. Food taste was not up to my preference but that was everywhere in Bali.
They didn‚Äôt provide a cloth hangar for drying clothes and so 4star. Otherwise, it is all good.","The bathroom was very dirty. I asked them to clean it, but nothing changed. The staff were neither friendly nor helpful.

The best thing about this hotel was the breakfast; it was amazing, delicious, and fresh. The location is good too, being close to Ubud center.","So lovely, excellent shower and a bath! The bed was so comfortable and everything was extremely clean and new. The staff were so friendly and the breakfast had a large selection","The room was very dirty and run-down. The AC unit smelled of mildew and leaked condensate into the room from where it clearly was unable to drain properly. There were ants all over and smelly sheets when we arrived. The staff originally wanted us to spend a night on the sheets so they could address them the next day, but we insisted they change them before we slept there since they said we could not switch rooms. The breakfast was awful, so we ended up eating out more than intended, which was fine since there is so much good food around, but I would rather just have had that cost left out in this case. This hotel was so disappointing because it looked nice from the outside and other reviews are not that bad. Overall, I would avoid this one. There are so many other great options in the area for the same or even lower prices.","We love our staying here! The staff was incredibly amazing and they helped us with everything with needed.
They offer many other services such as motor bike renting and tours in Ubud. The breakfast was also amazing and with many options.

The cocktails are AMAZING. Very matching savory design , 10/10 for the bartender/ designer of menu

Keep the philosophy of the restaurant in mind and you will discover new flavors or special cooking techniques. Check their website for the menu so you can already decide if it will be to your taste.
The 8 course menu was in the end to much for us, the 6 courses would have been more than enough.",Our 8-course culinary Odyssee‚Ä¶.

We just follow the directions on Google Maps, from Alam Green Lotus, and after a short walk along cute streets, the rice paddies appear. There are a lot of ducks in some of the fields - so adorable. At the end of the walk, on the main street, is Unity Cafe, where we've been having coconuts after our walks.",A very beautiful walk in nature among farm land and houses and hotels. I do not recommend to try to ride a scooter through on the pathway as it would be very difficult and stressful as it is near impossible unless you have advanced skills like the locals. Definitely walking is the way to do it. You can start at the south or north end. This is not an official tourist attraction so keep in mind that it is among the local community.,A beautiful walk with some interesting sights. Would recommend bringing water and reapplying sunscreen if doing this in the heat! Walkway is shared with motorbikes so be prepared to make room but it is a wonderful experience and would recommend,"This is Ubud‚Äôs best kept secret‚Ä¶yet is in the Lonely Planet guide!

Seriously, we don‚Äôt understand why so few people come to walk the urban rice fields, but so be it, we enjoyed an ‚Äúoff the beaten path‚Äù walk accessible through the centre of Ubud and only crossed a few people.

We did the loop and parts of it feel like walking in the jungle! Seeing the rice fields and farmers right in town is a treat and one of the highlights of our visit!","It's a nice walk if you feel like walking for an hour there and another hour on the way back.

The aesthetic of the different areas of the restaurant paired with the structured courses made for an interactive experience which evoked an emotional response to creative and well-balanced food art.
The food was exquisite, smart, and memorable! The staff from start to finish were kind and highly skilled in their craft. Will was down to earth and happy to check in and have a chat.

Anyone that visits Bali should make the trip to experience Room 4 Dessert !!","We had dinner reservations at Room4Dessert on a Sunday at 8 PM. The meal is 5 savory bites, 5 desserts, and 5 petit fours and you move between 3 different rooms for the meal. The first and last dining rooms are exposed to the outdoors and the second dining room is indoors. We did a spiritless pairing which consisted of 8 drinks in total. The number of drinks did not match the number of dishes so it would have been helpful if the staff explained which drinks should be paired with which dishes. However, we really enjoyed the meal. Although there is strong emphasis on dessert, I didn't feel like it was overwhelmingly sweet. The savory bites at the beginning of the meal were delicious and I left feeling very satisfied with the meal. My favorite savory was the pork ribs and favorite dessert was the pandanbert. At the end of the meal, you are given a coupon for 2 free chef's choice items at The Powder Room which was described to us as a candy shop. I was really excited to use the coupon, but it is closed on Mondays and we were leaving Ubud the next day. If you love desserts, I highly recommend eating at Room4Dessert for a really unique and fun dining experience.","Had the most incredible dining experience here! Everything was world class, from the food to the atmosphere to the service. We had one gluten free diner, and although they normally need a week notice to accommodate dietaries, there were able to create a gluten free menu with shorter notice and it was exceptional! The evening started with a garden tour and savory courses before we started on the deserts.  A perfect night!","I came for the dessert and I got so much more! I first heard of Room4Dessert on ChefsTable and knew that when I travelled to Bali I had to try their food. I got served 15 courses, five main, five dessert and five bite sized treats. At the start of the night I got shown a garden tour of the ingredients that they grow for the meals. The staff were very attentive and explained everything about the dishes when they served them. I watched as they prepared all the courses in front of me there was a beauty to how they were all being delivered. Attention to detail is key to every dish they serve. I am so grateful for this experience üôè
If you are thinking about it don't hesitate just book it in you won't regret it!
It's authentic, aesthetically pleasing, unique, fresh and local ingredients, storytelling, atmospheric, beauty and delicious!","fun and interesting concept serving small plates, 5 savoury courses, 5 desserts, and 5 petits fours. each very intricate and offering a good balance of flavours. there's an option for cocktail pairing that will give you 8 cocktails alongside the small plates. lovely experience with amazing service from the crew, especially Elias and Vivi. they move you from room to room for each segment. highly recommend, but note that while they do indeed serve small plates and desserts, it is more than adequate for a meal."

Stayed in 2 connecting rooms - perfect with 2 teenagers. Resort is traditional style, comfy beds, lots of space, large verandahs and clean and quiet. With 3 pools, they are not overly busy (often we had one of the pools to ourselves). The resort offers a good simple breakfast with staff who are great and helpful. As it is close to central Ubud, there are lots of options for meals outside of resort close by. Resort is surrounded by working rice paddy fields and it was interesting watching being worked as an added bonus. A very calm and relaxing location & stay.

And best of all, the prices are very reasonable for this quality of dining.

Could not ask for any better to celebrate my daughters 2nd birthday at this beautiful resort.","If this review was based on service while staying at pita maha we would give it a 5+ but there were several other contributing factors.

Before we arrived, while on a 17 hour flight to bali, we received messages that we didn‚Äôt confirm our reservation and they were going to give it away. Once we told them we were still going, it was okay. On our way to the hotel a week later, we were told the room had a leak but we would be upgraded for one night to a nice hotel. We were certainly taken care of as the upgraded hotel was amazing and pita maha transported us to and from and also gave us free massages and a floating breakfast for the inconvenience. The staff even decorated the room for us and filled the tub with flowers as it was our honeymoon.

The rooms at pita maha were really nice, though we had a bit of a mosquito problem in the room, even being certain to keep the doors closed. There was some construction on the other side of the river that was only a minor inconvenience.

Now the staff and service with amazing. Maid service in the morning and night, our water was always refilled. The staff in the restaurant were so friendly and welcoming. We had offerings outside of our room every day which made us feel special and like we were part of the pita maha family. We were even given a little gift as we left and it was such a nice touch to already unbelievable service. They also were very accommodating to my gluten allergy! They made us a special gluten free honeymoon cake!

The location is also perfect, just enough removed from the chaos so that it was quiet, but also very close to town if you wanted to walk a long walk or rent a scooter from the shop literally right next door.

Overall, would recommend this resort for the service and location!"

Highly recommended üëå","Cozy Haven with Room to Spice It Up!

üçΩÔ∏è Limited Choices: The menu is a tad basic, leaving you wanting more variety.

üë®‚Äçüç≥ Simple Delights: The food is simple, perhaps a bit too much. While it's nice, a dash more flavor could elevate the experience. Dal khichdi looked too pale. (Check pics attached)

üè† Charming Ambiance: The cozy setting creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, perfect for a relaxed meal. They have clothing to sell as well. Not sure where there focus lies.

üõ£Ô∏è Exploration Encouraged: While there are better Indian spots nearby, this one has its charm. If you're up for a simple and cozy vibe, give it a shot. However, nearby options offer a more adventurous culinary journey.

In a nutshell, this spot's simplicity has its appeal, but a touch more variety in the menu could turn it into a hidden gem. Great for a low-key evening, but don't hesitate to explore other flavors down the street!","I‚Äôm going to give this place some stars because the food is vegan/veggie. However, I am going to note a few things. Cost vs portions - I‚Äôm not sure why Indians believe their food should be overpriced, when most of the ingredients are super cheap. Portions here are small in comparison to other Indian restaurants. Taste - I‚Äôm seeing or tasting this more with Indian restaurants trying to create a contemporary feel to their menu, like boutique curry, which usually renders the food bland, lacking spice or salt. Originality - this is not your traditional Indian restaurant, it‚Äôs probably closer to traditional Indian food in some respect, but I‚Äôm sure anyone could argue that they missed the point with their recreation of some of the basics, like samosas and chutney. I still enjoyed my Kitcheri (I‚Äôve had better), and strange samosas with little filling.","Good Indian food in a beautiful space. There is seating in the front, inside and in a lovely garden in the back. The food is on the bland side, but the spicy ""podi"" powder helps. Ingredients are fresh and the Thali was great way to sample different dishes. The rose lassi was amazing. Polite staff.","I would say it's a great cafe- restaurant, and a pure veg place.
If you are going to Bali and want to visit a pure veg restaurant this is one of the places, I just had one complaint I visited this place twice on the first day my experience was good but on the second day I went early for the breakfast around 9 and I wasn't served fresh food, I could taste the masala and the batter was the remaining from the previous day.
So it would be great if the owner looked into that matter"

Everything was delicious and had a great balance of textures and flavors. The staff are very welcoming and friendly. The space is clean and has a nice music. Very recommended!,"After a great evening at R4D the other night we wanted to give breakfast a go at Powder Room. Prior to we spoke to Will and he recommended the egg and bacon muffin with fried chicken. Of course he is biased ü§®but he wasn‚Äôt wrong. That‚Äôs exactly what we got.

Charlene ordered it, and I (Ronny) did too, albeit two pieces of fried chicken. Man‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ it was so damn delicious, tender chicken, eggs cooked to perfection, crispy bacon, and the added caramelised onions really complemented it, all sandwiched between a home made muffin. It was exactly what we needed for our 7km round trip walk to enjoy this meal. Highly recommend you give this a go. Definitely 5 star worthy, and definitely a gym junky‚Äôs cheat meal (not that every day in Bali hasn‚Äôt been a cheat meal for us the last couple weeks). Get your protein hit peeps, with umami to boot!

For something sweet we had the babka, and it was nothing short of amazing. Not too sweet, great texture, and ingredients you can individually a taste, like with a great HiFi system where it has a wide sound stage and you can individually hear the instruments. It was very well balanced and delish.

The pastry item we had was the croissant. Just a good old plain croissant. Now croissants in Bali are a real gamble. The climate we think can really jeopardise them,  and what we are used to is flaky exteriors with buttery soft interiors with dozens upon dozens of layers, with just enough butter between each layer to give it the texture and flavour they deserve. The croissants here came close, but you have to make an exception due to the climate. Just about every croissant, probably all actually, we have had in Bali stops short of what a brilliant crossaint should feel like in terms of texture. The one we had here hit targets in the flavour department but texture wise it‚Äôs up there with the best we have had in Bali, but not back home; wasn‚Äôt flaky enough. So context is everything when hunting for French pastries in Bali, manage your expectations.

For the walk back home we had to get the ‚Äònot a mars bar‚Äô and the yellow marshmallow thingamabob. Needed a few extra calories for fuel, not that we didn‚Äôt fuel up prior. A sweet tooth‚Äôs dream, melt in your mouth marshmallow and caramel so decadent it should be contraband.

The cafe was cute, rustic, service was attentive, Will also put aside some time to have a chat with us. It‚Äôs great when the Chef spends time with his customers, as it adds to the whole experience. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, he wasn‚Äôt blowing his own horn or anything, we just spoke about food again, as well as restaurant recommendations in Ubud.

Overall we have to give it 5 stars. The whole experience, and food itself was brilliant. The croissant, as we said, in context of the climate, and with expectations managed, was excellent.","Little cafe in Ubud. Variety of sweetness choices to choose. I tried Vanilla Bomboloni, Smookies, it was yummy! The team is very kind and extremely helpful. Good vibes here only! The space is very clean and has nice music and this cafe is easy to find.","Lovely all round. Great coffee, wonderful sweets and patisseries.

The condition of the hotel and the rooms has degraded, it doesn‚Äôt look like the pictures on the website. There was no restaurant. We could tell that this has once been a nice place, but it hasn‚Äôt been upkept.

The room was not like the pictures, furniture was missing and there was mold in the sink and bathroom and the pillow was questionably dirty.

On the bright side, the aircon worked really well, and the view of the rice paddy was nice.

Overall it was just OK for the price, but they really need to update the photos so you know what to expect.","def would be back! spacious room with bath tub. strategic location, great view, great facilities (but they don't provide toothpaste and toothbrush), I can do tracking in Bukit Campuhan in the morning and shop at Bintang Supermarket. to be noted, the water for the bath tub wasn't really hot and the swimming pool needed to be cleaned regularly because it was kinda slippery on the floor. overall, it was a nice days to spend here. I'd love to recommend this place to my friends","we had booked two nights at the hotel, but did not have high expectations due to the price. The pictures online looked nice and almost looked like a new hotel. what greeted us was a dilapidated old hotel. The staff were nice and especially the nice cleaners. the hotel has two pools which were dirty at the bottom. The hotel is characterized by the fact that it is not renovated any more and that things are simply allowed to fall into disrepair. the rooms are old, there is dirt behind the panel for the television, holes in the wall, dirty duvets and worn terrace. the air conditioning works and is a plus.
not a hotel I would recommend to demanding guests or families with children. but if you are a backpacker and need a cheap place to sleep, it can easily be done. it is also quite an experience to see such a large hotel in disrepair, with all the rooms standing empty and almost abandoned. you can see that it was once a nice hotel in the 1800s.","Amazing hotel! Location is great, close to the center of Ubud. It‚Äôs quite, no roosters, no construction works, which is precious in Bali. Rooms are specious and clean, plenty of hot water. Pools are nice. Staff is friendly and helpful. The internet can be unstable sometimes but you still can work from the room. Definitely recommend this hotel if you stay in Ubud"

At night to lock the door we had to climb through the window to lock the door (which was a giant padlock) and then climb back in through the window.

Nikhil and Louisa are amazing yoga teachers, they take the time to address each student's individual needs and create a completely relaxed and serene atmosphere. The semi-open yoga studio is overlooking the rice fields into the jungle - there's no better place to practice yoga!

The food is amazing as well. There are two restaurants with very varied vegetarian dishes, tasty smoothies and an amazing breakfast with high-quality ingredients.

The spa treatments are great, too. You can choose from a variety of treatments, so they never get boring.

Great infinity pool nestled into the jungle. Fun in-house activities and lovely guided walk through the rice paddies.

Its a very relaxing and beautiful sanctuary.","Beautiful property and rooms. Villa room with rice fields view was gorgeous and serene.

Only feedback is that they need to update their misquote nets which have holes (I requested that my first jet be changed, but the second one had holes too). This is important because if you leave the light on in the room at night the bugs will find their way into the room, and currently also into the misquote net given the holes.

Also, the WiFi in the room stopped working at night, not sure why."

We even tried their massage service and it was exceeding our expectations :)

One downside is that there was a construction next door, so we always wake up with a drilling sound.","I arranged transport from the airport to the hotel. When I arrived, their man was there with my name. Felt like a rock star. I could have had a driver arranged by Anhera for my journey onwards but I already had arranged.

I stayed at Anhera for 11 nights. I was a solo traveller. When I first walked in, I was given a welcome drink and a big smile. I will miss those smiles especially when being brought breakfast in the morning. As for breakfast, there was enough variety and options to ensure I could have something different everyday. I didn't try the restaurant although the menu looked good and a reasonable price. I didn't use the spa offered. Again, prices looked reasonable.

Every day, my suite was cleaned. Nothing was taken, everything was left tidy as it should be. Even the garden was given the once over. I am a fairly private person and not once was I unnecessarily disturbed. With the suites being on different levels, people can not see into the suite. You can lay in bed or the jacuzzi bath (which was amazing), and look out across to Campuhan Ridge. Waking up to that view everyday was a reason to smile and made me not want to get out of bed.

There is a little wear and tear but nothing major. The main things were in place. A big comfy bed, a beautiful bathroom, linen changed, fresh towels provided, a kindness from all staff. There is a small fridge which is not stocked. There do have the standard kettle and water is given daily. 2 bottles.

The staff are not 100% with their English. I am 0% with my Indonesian and I have Google Translate so language barriers were not an issue and a smile is a universal language.

The location is a little away from the centre of Ubud but for me, that was perfect. The centre is noisy with many motorbikes and you can taste the air. To get to the centre (walk out of hotel, turn left, keep walking), it is only a 20 minute walk so nothing major. There is a mini-market across the road, an ATM and always a taxi driver ready. A little further down to the left is a bigger supermarket. If a spa is your thing, turn left or right and you can't miss. Also, look out for Nuris Warung. A simple, inexpensive but lovely little 'restaurant'.

I really believe that Anhera is perfect for families, couples (very romantic), and solo travellers. There are steps so not suitable for wheelchair users or those that have difficulty climbing stairs. If I am ever to return to Ubud, this will be the only hotel I would stay in. I have stayed in Hyatt Plaza, Marriotts, Intercontinentals, all 5* but I would choose Anhera everytime.

Anhera, thank you so much for being such wonderful hosts and god willing, I will return one day."
