You can buy different types of chips, the green leafs üçÉ one are so good üëå, peanuts, spices, strawberries üçì , flower seeds, orchids and bonsai.

Thank you for a welcoming environment, far surpassing any expectations!","I absolutely loved staying at Chakra Travern.
The owner is an angel who deeply cares about her guests. I haven't experienced this kind of loving hospitality since traveling in New Zealand 20 years ago.

The building has huge open common areas, a nice garden and an incredible roof terrace with amazing views of the mountains. There's plenty of space for your morning workout or yoga session. Don't let you fool by the old school looks. Believe me, there's a magical and kind energy in these walls that will embrace you once you have entered.

During my stay the people who arrived and left were all very conscious and open. People actually talked to each other instead of just staring at their phones.

Last but not least there is a great choice of excellent food on the menu and the kitchen is open all day.

I will definitely return to Chakra Tavern next time I am in the area. üôèüèª","Very nice place to stay a few nights in Bedugul.
Elena is a very nice person, she will help you make the best of your stay in this area.
