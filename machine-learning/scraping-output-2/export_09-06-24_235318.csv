We were there with our three children. Nature is a dream and the whole crew is so nice and extremely helpful. The atmosphere is very familiar and we enjoyed it very much. You are almost among locals and feel very well taken care of. Tours are offered that can be tailored to your own needs. The food is very authentic and delicious. The massage is amazing. We want to come back and can only recommend the accommodation. Thanks for everything. Your team is excellent!,"This place is perfect for people that really want to enter in contact with Nature in Bali. It's immersed in the jungle and the rice fields, every room is an independent bungalow, ideal if you want to enjoy tranquillity. The amazing staff prepares awesome breakfast and dinner, they were also very helpful in giving me tips on how to explore the area, organize activities for the guests and transports.
The place is definitely off the beaten track but absolutely worth it for people that value the experience.
I'll be back for sure the next time I'm in Bali","The place is so peaceful. I finally got a chance to rest. I love the nature surrounding it, the terrace overlooking rice fields with many fireflies visiting at night. The owner Dewi, is so kind and helpful. And the breakfast was so delicious. True Balinese cuisine. I will definitely come back!","We came back to Tepi Sawah for the second time as its very unique place to stay if you like connecting with nature, want to rest a bit from a busy life, get some knowledge about local people, village, jungle, religion etc. Highly recommend to do trekking with a guide Putu who speaks English very well and will show you jungle, do a meditation with you in temple in jungle and tells you a lot of stories. Food is excellent too, you can do a cooking class if you like or have a massage. If you like yoga or meditation - there is a yoga room for you to use. Recommend to come at least for 3 nights as you will not want to leave.","We stayed 2 nights here and had a wonderful time. It was a perfect place to experience a whole new environment. All the food prepared was sourced locally, and was delicious- was so nice to try local dishes.
We did the day trekking with Putu, which was a must, learning all about the plantations and rice fields, we learnt so much about the area, trying the local fruits on the way! It‚Äôs such a warm and welcoming place, and I would 100% recommend to anyone to visit, you wake up the most beautiful view of the rice fields. Also an amazing massage!"

Cosy place to sit. Very friendly owner. Recommended!!!,Best warung of our whole trip! Finally after trying several ones recommended here and there where we had poor experience we found this gem. The lady is super kind and cooks chicken on coconut charcoal.. it was delicious! Also the fried noodles were amazingly done. You sit in the typical balinese way and the atmosphere is very original. Many people come and go to pick up food from her which shows it's very wanted!,We really enjoyed our nasi goreng and grilled chicken! The people who run it are super friendly too. If you are looking for a place to have some fresh prepared Indonesian food in the area I highly recommend to make a stop here :),"Only had noodles by the time we got there, but was still delicious and the owner was great. Would recommend stopping if you're in the area.","The food is amazing, you can taste that a there is a chef at work. The service was heartwarming, felt like at the family table."
