Unique designed cafe, almost look like a bee nest. There are 3 floors of seating areas, some are shadowed & some are not.
The menu is not too much, but ranges from main dish, sides and desserts. The main thing that they offer here is the atmosphere & vibe, so don‚Äôt expect much from the food. For me it‚Äôs quite bland, although the portion is huge. The price also on the expensive side, but it‚Äôs Ubud, so I think it‚Äôs standart.
Despite all of that, won‚Äôt consider to come back though. ‚úåüèª","This restaurant offers fantastic food and a unique design layout. While it's located a bit out of the Ubud center, requiring a drive to get there, the open-air atmosphere with shaded huts for dining makes it worth the trip.

We enjoyed delicious chicken, burgers, and drinks, all at a great value. However, due to their popularity, they had run out of a few dishes and drinks during our visit.","Cool designed building integrated with nature. I ordered a piccolo and it was made really well with good latte art, the ratio of milk-coffee was spot on. My partner ordered a flat white and it seemed to have been made with less attention to detail. It was too milky and the ratio wasn't quite right. Serving the coffee with a small biscuit was a nice touch. It's a good place to sit for a while and chat. It was really quiet when we visited in the morning which I liked. The staff were friendly enough but not much chat. There were various cakes available that all looked good but we didn't try any. From a coffee lovers standpoint, it would be nice to have a choice of beans and some details on the serving plate about the coffee being used, but that's me being picky. Overall 3.5‚≠ê rounded to 4‚≠ê.","Went there for tea time. Unique building design and that's all about it. Food is average, desserts way too sweet. Seating space is dirty.. Both indoor and outdoor. When you build a cafe with an open space concept you'll have to give more effort to keep it tidy all the time.","Find this on Grab Dine In recommendation. Recalled that this place is well known for being picturesque, so we're a bit worried about the food

Very happy to find out that I was wrong, the foods are great. They have quite extensive interesting menus, but we're famished so we ordered Nasi Goreng Kambing and Nasi Goreng Bebek. We love it, generous portion and great taste. They serve em fast too

Price wise, it might not fall under affordable options, but still a good value for money. They got a promo with Grab Dine In as well, I think it's a 20% discount, making it an even better value for money"

Jungle fish is family  friendly, so if you want something that‚Äôs adults only, Jungle Fish isn‚Äôt the place for you. Great chill atmosphere.

The dessert I finished my stay with was spectacular.","Staff were so nice and friendly. Food was good. The pool and the other areas were beautiful, so scenic looking into the valley. Very clean and organised. Good menu. Not too bad value for money, there is a minimum spend and it's obviously not super cheap, but with a couple of drinks and sharing a pizza covered it - reasonable for the location and quality! Lovely day out.","Went to Jungle Fish for the first time for lunch.  As the name implies, it is located in a very picturesque setting in the jungle and is only 25 minutes from central Ubud.  The food is excellent as was the service.  You can also buy a day pass for 300k rupiah and utilize the pool facility.  I will definitely plan to return.","Absolutely stunning location. The staff were very helpful with the booking process upfront and accommodated special requests during my stay. Kids are welcome, which means it can get a little noisier (the smiles are worth it! ) at times. The food was good, too.

The views, amazing. The romantic dinner worth every penny and we got an awesome photo shoot too!","Our stay at the Jannata Resort and Spa in Ubud was simply wonderful. The entire resort is immaculate, with a high standard of cleanliness. The breathtaking views create a tranquil atmosphere that envelops the entire property. The facilities are superb, providing everything needed for relaxation. The staff stood out with their kindness and helpfulness, making us feel warmly welcomed and well cared for. The spa, in particular, impressed us with its excellent massages and treatments that left us feeling utterly refreshed.","This hotel is absolutely beautiful and they did an outstanding job on my wedding. My husband and I eloped here and they did an incredible job. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and all have amazing jungle views. The food is above average and reasonably priced at the hotel.

The only mild negative I would give is that it is not located walking distance to the town but the hotel is excellent and will shuttle you down if you want to go or you can take a short taxi ride.","What an experience! From the moment you arrive and are welcome with some fresh towels and a cold drink to the moment you enter your beautifully rose decorated room, everything was a dream. The resort is cute, has character, the staff is friendly and attentive, it is Balinese hospitality at its best. The rooms are very large and the bed really comfortable. We also used the amazing SPA, which is an incredible experience.
And best of all, the prices are really reasonable.
Fully recommended!","Jannata Resort is a magical place and the best resort in Ubud and all of Bali. Having stayed at various resorts throughout Bali, Jannata goes above and beyond is all areas but especially the service.

My wife and I love Jannata so much we decided to get married there and had an amazing ceremony coordinated by their staff Didi and Yuni.

Each room is tucked away in the lush forests with perfect views of the Ubud jungle and not a single house to be scene, you feel like you‚Äôre in paradise. The private villas with plunge pools are especially magical. The spa is also wonderful, we had great couples massages multiple times over the course of our stay.

The food at Jannata was particularly good compared to other resorts in Bali we have visited. They do a great western breakfast with fresh squeezed juices, perfectly cooked eggs and awesome pineapple pancakes and crepes. The Balinese food for dinner was also delicious with a nice selection of grilled seafood and Balinese noodle and rice dishes.

Our favorite part of the resort was the wonderful staff that made our stay so memorable. Over the course of a week, we really felt like we got to know the staff on a personal level. We cannot recommend this resort enough."

Chapung Sebali proves this impressively! The attention to detail in all areas - especially service, food and design - is second to none and shows what a wonderful experience a passionate team can create.

If you're looking for a place further away from busy Ubud, it's great. It has a restaurant, a swimming pool, SPA, and entertainment on-site. If you want to experience Ubud caf√©s and nightlife, then you may get a bit frustrated with the need for transportation even though the place does have a group of drivers who can help.

The employees are very friendly and make you feel welcome.

The restaurant offers breakfast, lunch and dinner, but if you're staying for a few days, it still may be a good idea to explore other places in the city centre.","Nestled in the lush landscapes of Ubud, Bali, Blue Karma is a sanctuary of serenity and sophistication. From the moment you step into this haven, the superlative service sets the tone for an exceptional stay. The rooms, a harmonious blend of comfort and elegance, boast meticulous organization ensuring every need is anticipated.

The hotel's restaurant serves up culinary delights that tantalize the taste buds without overtaxing the wallet, a pleasant surprise given the prime location. The staff, with their perpetual smiles and eagerness to assist, add a personal touch that makes your stay all the more memorable.

The infinity pool, maintained with impeccable cleanliness, mirrors the boundless sky, while the yoga classes offer a sublime union of mind, body, and spirit. The bathroom, with its unique access to the rice field, provides a connection to nature that is both grounding and exhilarating.

Attention to detail is evident in the thoughtful room preparation, both for day and night, ensuring a restful and rejuvenating experience.

Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

Our experience at The Shed in Ubud, Bali, left us enchanted with its serene ambiance, delightful cuisine, and impeccable service. With an overall rating of 4/5, here is a detailed breakdown of our visit.

1. Serene Ambiance: 4.5/5

The ambiance at The Shed is a testament to tranquility and relaxation. The unique shed-like structure adds a touch of rustic charm, creating an inviting space. With the added bonus of a view overlooking the lush rice fields, our visit during the rainy season became even more magical, enhanced by the gentle drizzle and cool breeze.

2. Exceptional Service: 4.5/5

The service at The Shed exceeded our expectations. The staff was not only friendly but also went above and beyond to ensure a seamless dining experience. Their attentiveness and warm hospitality added an extra layer of comfort to our visit.

3. Culinary Delights: 4/5

The culinary offerings at The Shed are nothing short of delightful. The Mac and Cheese and Pizza emerged as must-try dishes, boasting not only delicious flavors but also becoming apparent best sellers. Complementing our meal with a refreshing glass of orange juice elevated the overall dining experience.

4. Timing Constraint: 3.5/5

One drawback worth mentioning is the limited operating hours. The restaurant closes at 9 PM, which might be a challenge for those seeking a late-night dining experience. However, the quality of the overall experience compensates for this minor timing constraint.

In Conclusion:

The food is presented artistically, and the flavors are so well put together that every bite is exciting. The whole experience is remarkable & memorable!

The way everything is served, the view, the live, yet subtle music adds such an elegance to every dining experience I've had there. I love this place so much that I'm pretty sure I've ordered everything on the menu, some even twice!

Do yourself a favor and book a villa or suite there, because the breakfast included in the stay is something I wake up missing every day since I left!

The ingredients are high quality, the flavors are exquisite, and the service is warm and welcoming. I couldn't find a single thing to change about my dining experiences at The Upper Deck, everything exceeded all my expectations.

The staff always remembers all the guests names and even the suites/villas they are staying in.
Intan, Rai, Midi and the rest of the Upper Deck staff make their guests feel so cared for, and you can truly feel how genuine they are.

The location and decor is lovely to look at however on a boiling hot and humid January night one would expect insect coils to be placed around.
We were eaten alive by ants and mosquitoes.
The food was upstyled classic Indonesian.

Service needs training. The over attentive staff almost pulled my plate from underneath my fork why I place it down.

More importantly, this is a thoughtful establishment; they have staff ready 24/7 ready to assist, insect repellent set up, they come to shut the blinds every evening, eye masks for the wifeys, well equipped kitchen and stocked up toiletries, prepared list of food and services, very much like a full fledged hotel. Those who are complaining about bugs should not even come to ubud in the first place; we're in their territory. One thing though, Aircon is not strong enough for the whole unit (cloud villa).

Everything about Cloud Nine Estate has been carefully thought out - mineral water provided, bug repellent, beach towels, afternoon tea, wind down time to keep bugs away, hydrating eye masks during wind down time. You can tell that a lot of thought and care has gone into this place. The staff were honestly the biggest highlight here. We learnt so much about them and the Balinese culture through such great interactions with them. Pak Suba was wonderful and helped us improve our Bahasa Indonesian.

Sitting on one of the lushest cliffs in Ubud overlooking a breathtaking river jungle view, there is nothing like the Santa Mandala. Imagine a mosaic artist retreat meets psychedelic Smurf Village. Or an elevated precursor to Meow Wolf (Santa Fe).

The rooms are large and each a unique experience on a little tour, plus there‚Äôs a community kitchen with a view and several communal areas for chilling and contemplation.

If I were a writer, I could imagine perching here for months to soak up the vibes and enjoy the serene seclusion (while being close to everything in Ubud Central) until the great work was done.

This place could easily be a Bali tourist destination of it‚Äôs own if it decided to grow beyond lodging and offer shops and such. As is, it feels like a on homage to art, humanity, and the local gods.

We had breakfast first then came for dinner, it was so good.     5 starsüëå","This Restaurant is by far one of Bali's finest! I have eaten at many 5 star fine dining venues in Australia and this is right in line with them.
A true hidden gem of Ubud and one you must try whilst in the area for a gorgeously romantic evening. Spoil yourself and your taste buds, you will not be disappointed here!
The service is fantastic, their English is possibly better spoken than most Australian's. Pronunciation of wines was that of a cellar door sales person. Superb!
The atmosphere was romantic and the BEST view in Ubud. Simply private and stunning being wrapped up in the jungle whilst under the stars.
The food...... presentation and taste was exceptional. Fresh food given the utmost respect and you could taste the flavour of a passionate chef and their team in every bite!
We will be back having dinner there everytime we go back to Bali. It was 5 Star!!!!!",Really amazing dinner! Great food and they had entertainment that was lovely and so interesting to watch!,"Really Nice place, the atmospehere is cool and the food good for a cheap price"

Unlike stated in some of the previous comments , everything was neat and clean during our 10 days here.","Great place to stay in Ubud - it feels like living in a jungle but comfortable, clean and with great service.

In the day you can see the tops of the trees and in the night you can hear the cicadas sing. I also love the shower as it is open air, decorated with nature and with cool stones to walk on. The bed is soft and clean. Although there‚Äôs no aircon and TV, the weather is cool and I like that it‚Äôs sustainable (makes you appreciate nature a lot more).

Will recommend if you want a unique experience in Bali.","Place with great potential, unfortunately run down by unprofessional staff that does not care or does not know how to care. We had rats in our bedroom, kitchen, and saw rats in the communal kitchen as well.
The place is dirty, especially communal areas (bathroom and kitchen) and pool (black slime all over the sides). Parasols so moldy that mold falls down on you when you sit underneath (on dirty spotty lounge chairs).
The garden is beautiful and you are in touch with nature, but that is about it. We stayed in 4 different villas of similar setting on Bali, the others were fantastic, this one was a complete let down.","Great staff, fantastic view, beautiful joglos. For everybody who enjoys wilderness with all the comfort. We‚Äòll come back again.",Beautiful and blissful place to stay ! Staff and caretakers are really prompt and responsible .

Wonderfully friendly owners. Dewa Juni gave me an impromptu lesson about Balinese culture/language.

And best music I‚Äôve heard out of all the restaurants I‚Äôve been to.

I can‚Äôt wait to come back!
Yes they do delivery.

It‚Äôs a great place to stop for a meal on the way to Tegallalang from the west side of Ubud.","The food are soooo delicious with very friendly prices. They do the dishes fast and pretty. And staffs are nice, too.",Very nice and cute place with good food and prices :) I went twice there and enjoyed the food every time,"It's a small restaurant with excellent food, reasonable prices, and great service.

We ordered the Sesame Crusted Tuna, the Laksa, and the chicken wings. Everything was cooked to perfection and had a homemade feel. Moreover, the prices were surprisingly affordable, considering the high quality of the food. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a satisfying meal.

We had 2 cocktails, 1 juice, 3 dishes and a bottle of water.

Additionally, the restaurant offers views of the jungle, but since we visited late at night, there wasn't much to see. Lastly, I'm not sure if it's a temporary issue, but during our visit, they were not accepting credit card payments. However, given the reasonable prices, it didn't pose much of a problem","Best Nasi G in Ubud. The Chef does private catering for Villas and you can tell. High quality food, good portions, clean kitchen and lovely service, and a nice view."

The staff exhibited a remarkable level of friendliness and attentiveness.
Overall, I hold a favorable impression of my experience at umah lawas ubud  and would not hesitate to return in the future.","The reception was entirely unaware, even surprised, by the fact that guests would arrive. The entire way to the room was dirty, with discarded cigarettes in the flower beds.

Then came the highlight: a room, that stank of mold and a mattress which had hundreds of very peculiar black spots on the head end of the mattress.","Staying 3 nights at this acommodation. Garden view room was very spacious with balcony and patio. Simple but beautifully decorated, the only thing we needed to watch was, the wooden floor could be slippery. Anything else was clean and tidy. Our kids'room was deluxe pool view and had a small kitchen, allowed us to warm up some meals suring the stay. Breakfast was provided by WYAH and it was okay. Not really special due to limited choice yet the portion was large and enough to fill our belly to be prepared for busy days exploroing Ubud. Mas Bidi the one in charge was very helpful and responding fast to our needs; laundry, online food order, mosquito repellents etc.","I think stay only one night is wrong is better stay more than one night because this villa is bery amazing.
Cozy villas, quiet location, beautiful pool. Rooms are spacious and super clean! The staff is friendly and highly recommend!",Umah Lawas was beyond expected. You will find yourself surrounded by nature and in an unique environtment. The good thing is that is not really far from Ubud center. Maybe 10/15 min by car or bike. The room I stayed was super clean and very comfy. Reading in the balcony was very relaxing and the pool area is also great. I would definetely recommend this place. Thank you for everything!

Nathalie is a superhost - extremely helpful and responsive, just let her know what your concerns are and she will sort them out immediately. A pity we didn't get the chance to meet her. We will definitely be back next time if we come to Ubud again!","They fill the ‚Äúminiral water tank‚Äù woth dirty chloride water. Got sick from the water. In the evening the showers have cold water. The pool is very dirty and I would not recommend swim in it. The airconditioning makes a lot of noise so it hard to sleep.

Overall the place has potential but for now I would recommend thinking twice about staying here.","Lovely, French boutique accommodation. Natalie went above and beyond to make our stay special and she is an interesting woman with a fascinating life. The breakfast has the best butter in Bali. The location is up the Campuhan Trail, so a beautiful area with lovely walking trails and easy walk to cafes and a few spas and restaurants.

There were ample spaces for lounging and eating. The best part was a private pool surrounded by lush greenery and big enough for our kids to play Marco Polo and other pool games. The host Devy was so incredibly helpful and arranged drivers for us throughout our stay and referred us to great activities like visiting the monkey forest and doing whitewater river rafting. The location of the home was convenient to many sites in Ubud, but separated enough to be peaceful and tranquil. We were out in the middle of beautiful rice fields and surrounded by fireflies.

Complete kitchen amenities and utensil. Clean pool but not a kids friendly since pool dept around 1.5m. If you travel by car, please reconsider since the resort are indeed surround by paddy field and cannot reach by car. Search for The Pengkolan Warung instead on google maps since that will be your meetpoint with owner. You can park your car with risk near the meet point.

Tq üíõüíõ",Bad for the location only..too far from the main road to This Villa /Homestay ..overall is good except location and main road connecting to the villa only .#The Main Reason .,The villa is amazing. It is peaceful and serene set in amongst rice fields. The owner was there to greet us and help with our luggage as its a 300m walk from the main road.  The path you can't walk in the dark safely so you will need a light if you do. The villa is about 10mins from Ubud centre by car or bike which can be a down side at times but a positive at the same time. You can walk the path outside the villa into town centre. It will take about an hour and it is beautiful. There are little art and food stalls along the way to look at or grab a bite to eat or drink. If you don't want to go into town to get something to eat there is a lovely little warung at the end of the path or you can go to Pyramids of Chi which is about 30m down the main road. Our housekeeper I cannot say enough nice things about her. She was amazing and I miss her breakfasts she made us every morning. Can't wait to book our next trip!,"If you like a private pool and 4 bedrooms not to expensive, more to relax its in ricefields, not for shopping or a night out, a warung for breakfast close by and sunset warung for a great lunch or dinner!"
