The entry fee was so cheap and was more than worth it.
I cannot wait to return to this peaceful place.","I had a wonderful time visiting Pura Puseh Desa Batuan Bali, a beautiful Hindu temple in the village of Batuan.

It was a memorable and enriching experience for me.","To visit temple, usually it us needed to cover sholders and mandatory to wear a Sarong. I visited during the week and payed 30.000 rp to enter and they lent me a sarong in front of the main entrance.
Ceremony happened at 6pm followed by cultural performances of dance and theater. It was really beautiful to see!","Cute little temple.
It is a fast visit unless you get a guide to tell you the story behind it.
