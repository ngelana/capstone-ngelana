You can also buy cakes other sweets like banana bread. I also love that you get free water.
The cappuccino is great.
For dinner they also have great options. I can recommend the butter chicken and power plate.",This place was lovely. A couple of friends had recommended and it was super close to my villa so I took myself for a late breakfast. Staff were friendly. The restaurant was busy but they found a space for me on a large table with only a small group on it. The food was delicious and the drinks were great too - nice coffee and fresh juice. The menu for non breakfast items also looked great and I will be sure to go and try some of them out if I am in the area again.,"Atmospheric place with lots of plants, pleasant music and spacious kids playground.
The service is average. We waited 20 minutes for a bill and then they tried to sell us olive oil for the salad dressing for extra 10k üòÅ.
The food was not so good. First of all, we truly struggled to find something to our taste. Maybe a vegetarian would find it better. Secondly, it's overpriced. And not very tasty.","Have eaten here at least 4-5 times during my stay at Uluwatu. Find no flaw in the food quality (fresh ingredients and healthy options with vegan choices) -- ranging from healthy breakfast food, power smoothies, detox juice, keto salad, to Asian fusion / hangover comfort food. Friendly and professional service, and you never have to wait long for the food to come. Great and relaxing ambience with good choice of background music supported by decent sound system (not loud and just right to lift your mood).

The only downside is that there's no local food option on the menu (but then that's not the focus of this place). Just putting it out there in case anyone visits this place with such expectations!","I ordered butter chicken with naan bread.

The rice and the sauce itself was allright, but the bread was not really naan bread. It was like fried old bread and was not even shaped like a bread, it was like shredded and very oily.

I asked the staff If I could get some white bread instead because I like to dip some bread to butter chicken but all they had was toast bread for me, I wasnt happy with that and just ate my rice and sauce.

Im writing this review because of the attitude I got from the staff.

The attitude I got after very friendly ‚Äùcomplaint‚Äù was crazy.

None of the workers checked on me anymore, I had to ask for the check many times because they didnt bring it to me‚Ä¶ after paying, they didnt say thank you or anything. Just mute. Basically they stopped serving me.

When we stood up and left, I even greeted the workers and the manager who I complained to but they didnt greet me back, I felt that was pretty wild from them as I didnt make a fuss about my food, I complained really gently‚Ä¶"

Yes, there is some construction happening next door, but even though our room was closest to it, it really wasn't an issue at all. The rooms were great and the enormous bed was so comfortable! The air con was top notch. Staff cleaned the room daily and were very friendly and polite. Buffet breakfast was really good and we had good vegetarian meals at both restaurants. All the breads served were soooooo good! My partner and I both had a great experience getting massages at the spa. Pool was beautiful, we only wished it was open a little later for a dip in the evening. I'm surprised to see people whinging in some of these reviews! We loved it and would definitely recommend to anyone travelling to Uluwatu.","Amazing place for this price, service is perfect. Rooms are pretty new, pool is absolutely nice, very good Italian restaurant inside. Compliments while check in ( champagne and nice desserts)
Also i lost my earring during my stay, i was very upset. They took my number and promised to find it for me and can you imagine they did find it in 1 week in the parking area, and contacted me. Its incredible. I give it 10 from 10 üëç recommend","We just had an amazing nine days at this property. The service was top notch, we arrived late at night on my wife‚Äôs birthday and Raj and team organised sweets and a candle for us to sing her happy birthday, they left a nice note on the bathroom mirror as well.

There‚Äôs mention in the comments of construction work next door but in all honesty other than seeing the machinery, we did not notice it at all.

We will be back for sure.","We had the most amazing stay here for our last night in Bali. I wish we had stayed here longer. Everything was perfect. It was so nice to stay in a hotel where the bathroom was inside and part of the room. (We had stayed in many hotels, even high end ones, where the bathroom or shower area were part of the room but outside and there were at time mosquitoes in the outdoor bathroom.) I can't tell you how much I enjoyed not having to go outside to use the toilet or shower. We were greeted with pastries and chocolates, a bottle of wine and a free minibar. There was an espresso maker in the room. They had beautiful pool area. All the public areas were fantastic. The beach and town area were just a short walk away from a private room key operated gate. Breakfast was delicious. My daughter had an earlier flight than me and hanging out at the hotel where I waited for my midnight flight was delightful. We were both able to use the spa locker room to shower and change. They even gave me a key for my own private locker so I could lock up my belongings in the spa area. The room was super clean. The front lobby had juice, fruit, water and delicious cookies. Perfection!! I was so happy there. Thank you for providing me with an amazing stay.","Five stars for helping my partner and I celebrate a lovely valentines. ‚ú®üôè

The service was absolutely wonderful. My partner and I arrived at 1am due to a flight delay and we checked in with a kind and patient staff at the front desk. The staff at the restaurant was always so welcoming and helpful. Breakfast options was absolutely splendid. We also did a floating breakfast and the team did such an amazing job setting it up‚Ä¶ it was beautiful ü•πüôè The main pool area was beautiful and I felt safe and comfortable to lounge there as long as I liked. There were fun floating chairs and noodles for use as well.

We had booked a couples massage and my masseuse made sure I was getting exactly what I wanted, and kneaded out my stiff knots - the best massage I‚Äôve had in a long time. The spicy ginger tea served after was rejuvenating. We also had a set meal booked and once again the kitchen staff was extremely accommodating.

While our bedroom was Infront of the construction area, we heard no noise and slept well into the morning. Would highly recommend staying here if you‚Äôre looking for a chill trip to bali and staying in Uluwatu."

I was in Uluwatu for a few days and needed to keep active, and this was exactly what I needed. Classes were excellent with good quality coaching (though I was only giving a partial effort while recovering from a Hyrox race). The facility has everything you need in terms of equipment (especially if you are training CF or Hyrox), energy and vibes! No AC was not a problem for me either. Maybe it‚Äôs a bit on the pricey side but still a fraction of what I pay for my box back home!","Absolutely amazing gym ‚Ä¶ great atmosphere, best trainers, awesome classes, fab music, quality food ‚Ä¶ Everything you could ask for ‚Ä¶ best gym in Bali, highly recommend ‚Ä¶ honestly so friendly and welcoming for everyone :)","We were in ulu for 2 weeks and trained there the whole time.

The rooms have an ensuite bathroom and are equipped with air-conditioning. They have a free shuttle bus going every 30m to your beach of choice and they also offer that towards the fire dance. They have free dinner every night sometimes including dessert. The free dinners are a great way to meet people. (The rooftop is great to meet people in general at night) The hostel also locks the big doors at night and you only get in via your key, that's a nice feeling.

I put the 3 stars down because when they 'clean' the rooms they just remake the used beds and mark them as clean. I've been in the room twice while they were cleaning and both times they did that to both beds. One of the ladies that came after check-in noticed the dirt and asked for clean sheets. They also don't thoroughly clean the bathroom and the walls have black mold on them.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great place for meeting people, good location, and good shuttle services. But asking the price per night that they are asking, you should be able to assume they freaking clean/wash the sheets and bedding.

I left my bedding and wet towel on one big organised pile. No possibility of reusing that.

The reception staff was friendly towards me.",Its a good hostel to meet people but overall very dissappointed in the level of service from the staff. They need to learn how to be friendly  towards guests. They were too busy on their phones most of the time to want to help with any requests we had. Private rooms are over priced with poor WiFi. The dinner in the evening was nice and has a good view from the rooftop. Good location,"I was here three times now and Eki - the owner - and the whole hostel team are the absolute BEST. So kind and helpful. The rooms are clean, the location and the view is amazing. You will meet friends for a lifetime here üí´üòä","Staff is so nice! The pool area, etc, are all pretty nice. Reason for 4 stars is that my room smelled pretty bad like mold, really bothered me the first night. They put an air freshener up, which was great, but my clothes had to be washed upon checking out. For $50 a night for a private room I would expect a bit better! I think the other dorms were fine. It‚Äôs the private rooms in the basement that are a bit off.

Really a good place next to beaches and everything else though.","I had a wonderful 5 day stay here!! The best part is the free dinner every night (not just because its free) but because you get to meet so many other people from the hostel. I made some really great friends here.

The hostel location is perfect. There are so many cafes, restaurants and yoga studios within walking distance. The hostel also offers a free shuttle service to the beach. Blue beach and Bingin Beach are walkable from the hostel. You can rent scooters from the hostel too for cheap.

The beds have curtains which it great for privacy!! And each person in my room got 2 lockers (1 big and 1 small) so you could lock all your belongings away.

The only improvement I have is the shower. It didn‚Äôt drain too well and felt a little dirty because of this. In saying this the rooms were cleaned every day."

The rest i loved it!!! Very fresh and healthy food, dinner with a sunset, the people very nice and efficient! No direct access to the beach, you have to go out of hotel. I will say more family (kids) oriented!  Enjoy!","Last year, I went to Bali and I stayed at a place called Mu. It is in Uluwatu in front of the crystal-clear ocean. I went with my beautiful family.

It has an amazing big pool out the front and the spaghetti tasted like proper Bolognese. The breakfast was amazing too as the eggs were elite. The rooms were fun because they were divided with a pool in the middle.

Overall, I would give it 5 out of 5 stars because everything was new to me and fabulous. My favourite bit of it is out the back where Bingin and Impossibles are because I love surfing.

The property is simply beautiful with lots of trees and flowers around which makes it so chilled to lay in the daybeds and longchairs.
Staff is always smiling, incredibly organized and super friendly.
We loved the Infinity pool with a great view to the ocean - we enjoyed watching the surfers from up there ;).
Food in the bar and restaurant is delicious with good variety of all flavours including veggie/vegan options.
Amazing how this hotel is operated - thank you for a perfect stay ;).","Dissapointed with the stay here, wish I read the reviews before I stayed. Very very basic accommodation, monkeys and mosquitos. Towels not clean, showers not clean. Bugs and ants crawling on the bed. Only good thing is the beautiful view of the ocean. Spa is not a spa. Would not recommend. This place is a one star shack not worth the $$$ when it equates to staying in a 5 star resort. Food at restaurant was really nice only good thing.","We just visited the restaurant,
nice location, food was just ok.

unfortunately they serve us just 1 portion of sides for a 2 person fish plate, when we tried to extra order more sides like rice we got told they out of it( hance the reason if the small portion of sides)"

Paired it with their homemade almond milk iced latte‚Äîdivine! A true gem offering fantastic food, drinks, and an unbeatable vibe. Plus, the staff couldn't be friendlier. Highly recommend a visit!","This is the BEST!!!! We went to this amazing place after a surfing lesson, and we were so tired and hungry. The atmosphere is ü•∞. You WILL fall in love with it. The staff was really friendly. Had a big menu to choose from. Me and my partner and I tried out a platter for 2. Everything in there looked so delicious. It was worth the prize. Plenty parking outside for scooters. TRY IT!!","A pleasant place to have a breakfast or brunch at with a very airy atmosphere. They serve a wide menu with something for anyone. I had an omelette, a smoothie bowl, and a coffee.

Out of those, the smoothie bowl was 10 out of 10. The omelette was not the best with it's ingredients just not coming together, taste could have been better but great toast. Coffee was okay.

The service was pretty quick but staff looked like they don't want you there really.","We went for lunch cause we were going to the Coworking later and we loved it. They had a very wide variety of dishes, and we tried the Shakshuka eggs and the brekkie sandwich and they were both super tasty. The drinks were very nice (not too sweet in comparison to other places) and the staff was super nice!","BEST BREAKFAST in Uluwatu, do not miss this gem!!

We enjoyed our first breakfast so much that we returned for a second round on our last morning before leaving Uluwatu.

First, the environment is one of the best ones in Uluwatu and the service was so kind and friendly, we truly felt so comfortable and almost at home. I really recommend sitting in the floor area which is watching the kitchen area that's right in the middle of this beautiful and spacious cafe.

On both times we shared the chela toast (replaced the chickpeas with sliced avocado) which is the best avo toast we had during our 3 weeks trip to Bali, by far!!
In addition, on our first visit we ordered the acai bowl which was so refreshing and delicious, and on our second visit we ordered the oh my goji smoothie bowl which was also so good that I was sorry I didn't get a chance to try the rest of their smoothie bowls!
Lastly, don't miss their green juice named the Queen - it's named that way for a reason, and we ordered it on both of our breakfasts.

If you're looking for a cool breakfast spot with great service, this is the place!! 5/5 in all of the parameters."

Clean, newly renovated and friedly staff. Multiple levels of enjoy with a sunset view to bring on the just right night time vibes. Just mind the stair case on your culinary voyage!","The food and drinks were nice with many great vegetarian and vegan options.

It was a little bit hard to find, especially when you start from the wrong position. We had to pass right through restaurants and houses and small areas and stairs which felt like the wrong way all the time. But after a while we reached the beach and then walked along the beach to the caf√©. When we left the caf√© we discovered there were an easier way back.

It's a nice spot to watch wind surfers and the waves of the ocean.

I would almost give it five stars, but I don't really like when the restaurants allow souvenir sellers to come up to your table and try to sell things. That would never ever be accepted in Europe. When you've entered a restaurant you don't only pay for the food, you pay for a place to sit and eat in peace.","Great place to chill and watch the surfers do their thing until sunset. Kinda hard to find via Grab or Gojek because it's a walk from a parking lot, but there are lots of signs and locals will point you in the right direction if you ask kindly.

Bear in mind this place is CASH only and they've got a pretty small menu, but the margaritas are EXCELLENT and the vibe is very dreamy at sunset.

The teriyaki bowl was delicious.

Only drawback was that the staff seemed pretty limited so if it's a packed house you'll have to go directly to the bar or hope you can flag down the poor waiter running around trying her BEST to make everyone happy all at once.

Overall. No regrets at all. Would definitely go back and watch the water till sunset any time.","Definitely a must visit place. For the location you'd think the food and drinks would be expensive but the food was so well priced and delicious. The view out over the water was amazing, definitely a great place to go at sunset to enjoy a drink. They did get our order wrong but quickly got it replaced so the service here was great too.

Thank you for everything! üôè","This was the second hotel of my partner and I first ever Bali trip at the end of March 2024. The location is in a quiet place which feels safe and secure away from noise. It is not right in the centre of Uluwatu so you will need some kind of transport like scooter, bike or car to get to places ( which is very easy to get and a short ride away) however, we wanted somewhere more remote, so it worked perfectly for us.

The reason for four stars with the room is because we found the air con to be a little noisy. Maybe there was a way to have it on during the night without making noise however if there was we couldn‚Äôt work it out. Rather than that the rooms are beautifully done. The bed is very comfortable and has netting around which is good, definitely a plus considering the nature environment around.

The pool looks beautiful however is quite small and would be better if a bit larger although we had such limited time at this hotel that we did not get the chance to make use of the pool anyway.

We have one recommendation for improvement. The food is lovely however we believe the portion sizes are too big leading to food wastage. In particular the fruit plates cold be reduced. We noticed a lot of guests not finishing food and juices which could also be less volume in a smaller glass.

The staff here including security are just so lovely, friendly and accommodating. They constantly making sure you have everything you need.
The security at the hotel is a great addition which makes you feel even more safe and secure.","After trying out many different places in Bingin, Terra has come out on top as the clear favourite. I‚Äôve stayed 3 times now, and will continue to come back and recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Bingin. The staff are what make this place so special, they are all so lovely and welcoming and it really feels like home. The style is different to most places around and so aesthetic, it really is a joy to spend time there. It‚Äôs also nice to see they take feedback on board, as each time I‚Äôve visited an improvement has been made to the room. The direct access to the bingin beach path is a bonus as well, super handy, but you still feel like you‚Äôre in your own little world. The included breakfast is one of the best I‚Äôve had in Bali, cocktails are delicious and the matcha is perfect. Always looking for an excuse to come back again :)","This has hands down been my favourite stay in Bali!

The rooms were absolutely beautiful, I loved all the simple pink and earthy tones and all the little handmade touches üíï

The little back alley out to the beach and cliff top bars and cafe were super convenient and great for a very relaxed stay - you never had to wander far for stunning beach views!

But I think the highlight of the stay were all the lovely staff, they were so accomodating and friendly, and would do anything to help! They really made the whole experience perfect!

We hope to see you all again this year! üíï"

We spent many hours here watching the sunset, beautiful views!
Bathroom cleaning could be improved","We came around 7.30pm. There are 200 steps to this place. The initial restaurant that we wanted to dine had most of the items finished, thus we went here instead. The lady staff at the cashier where you select the seafood had terrible bad attitude. She treated us Asian differently from Caucasian, her bias is very obvious. Her attitude stink so bad and she is so arrogant, before us were a Caucasian guy and she kept laughing and smiling with him, whereas she wasn‚Äôt interested in attending to us. Literally just gave us such an ugly behavior. Doesn‚Äôt even smile and can‚Äôt be bothered to reply us when we asked her about the seafood. However, the male server staff were friendlier. Food wise would be a 2 out of 10. It is practically tasteless. Just take some prawns and fish and throw it in the grill. Food is terrible. Unless you are drunk, then you might enjoy the tasteless food üòÜ. We paid about IDR 300k for 1 fish and 6 pieces of prawns. Atmosphere: it is dark by 7.30pm, so you can‚Äôt see any view. Should have gone to jimbaran instead.","We went there to see the sunset and to enjoy some grilled fish dishes. But we didn‚Äòt eat there. The problem is that, we have ordered the fish (Mahi-Mahi and the grilled shrimps), which were put in plastic bags without cooling or water cold cubes. Unfortunately, after ordering we have seen some reviews here that some people got food poisoned and they described also the hygiene, exactly  like I have seen there. So we decided not to eat it. So if you go there, you could have a drink and enjoy the sunset.","We were staying in the hotel next door so ate at Lucky Fish everyday during our stay. Fantastic location, every meal tasted great and would definitely recommend the breakfast nasi goring. Service was fast and even offered to bring it to our room when we asked for takeaway."

I wonder why I had not come across this outstanding restaurant before. Couldn't recommend the house enough.

Merci Freddy for running such a great operation!!!! You can count us back next time we visit Bali. Bingin is where it's at!","One of the best spots for sunset in Uluwatu. Absolutely stunning. Be sure to get there for 6pm or 6.30pm at the latest and book a table. Food was surprisingly delicious, as the menu was limited. We had the build a plant based plate (mind, they give big portions!) and the bolognese. I would just rewrite the menu so it makes more sense and include more varied plant and fish dishes. Not much choice in terms of seafood. There are also lots of mosquitoes however so make sure you bring insect repellent!"

Everything was absolutely perfect. The food is the best food you'll find in Bali. I met the chef, omg he is amazing. The staff makes you feel at home, they are in absolutely all the mini details. For example every time that my mum wanted to stand up, some one would ALWAYS come to helo her. Lovely to my daughter, friendly, happy and super welcoming. It felt like we were all a big family.

And the wedding..... I am speechless. The venue looked out of a magazine, the food was perfect we didn't need a dj because their sound system was on point. Mellissa is going to be forever in my heart cause she made my wedding day a dream come true!

The location in Bingin is perfect if you want to explore Uluwatu but still stay in a more quieter area.

A big plus is the really nice pool area, with stunning nature view.
The complimentary breakfast was yummy - I especially can recommend the fresh fruits with granola!

Seed, Cashew Tree and Beach BBQ great food choices.","The first night we had very loud roosters, when we mentioned to the front desk they were very attentive and put us in another room. The rest of our stay was amazing. Food and coffee was basic but plenty to get your day started. The food staff was very friendly and Kadek and Yogi made us feel very welcome.

The pool area is very old and potentially dangerous, especially for children. The wooden floor there is falling apart and there are nails and wood pieces all over, avoid at all cost coming here with kids.

Firsty the hotel looks nothing like the pictures on google. As the day progressed we saw more things of concern. The AC in our room did not work, Baku knew this and still placed us in this room, of which cost 1,35mil. In our room, the pitched roof is a thin sheet of bamboo with absolutely no insulation. Its like a sauna in the room at night. The wet areas were super slippery in the shower area and stairs to the room.

The pool is full of green slippery algae and the rooms are made up of reclaimed ""salvaged' timber. This hotel is unkept, and is very hazardous. I guess you live and learn from bad experiences. I will never step back in this hotel, and I hope that people see this review and stay elsewhere. This hotel is not fit to house guests in.
