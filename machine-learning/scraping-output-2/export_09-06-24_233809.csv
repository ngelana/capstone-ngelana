Fyi : Come here by car and motorcycle allowed and they have access and parking area and just pay 5000 thousand rupiah (local) you can enjoy the beautiful waterfall inside the ricefield.","Amazing waterfall! The walk down is very beautiful with amazing views of rice terraces as well as the jungle as you get lower. There are some steep sections of the trail but they have railings to help. When we went we were one of only 4 groups and it felt very private. The water is very nice and it was great to take a swim. I highly recommend coming here.

I've been here so many times but just got a time to put the review. If you're tired of the crowded in the central part of Jatiluwih, especially at lunch time, I really recommend you to come here. Located before ticket checking and little bit remote, but has better view and less crowded people on the rice field. The place is quite big, has a lot of dining table, and some attractions. They serve indonesian food, vegetarian, western, pizza, side dish, and dessert. For drink they serve coffee, juice, tea, milkshake, cokctail, and mocktail. I ordered Ayam Bakar Madu, Gurami Nyatnyat, and Special Pancake. The Ayam Bakar Madu was perfect, very soft, and the sambal was tasty and spicy. That Gurami Nyatnyat was also good, the nyatnyat soup was good, the fish was not so dry but still enjoyable, honorable mention for the sambal matah, it was really nice. I really wanted to try their Laklak, since they said it was different than general Laklak. But we came just after rain, and they needed a lot of time to prepare the Laklak. Instead, I ordered Special Pancake as dessert with ice cream. It was comfort dessert, so not much thing to comment. They also have side attractions like kids playground and Bali Swing, same like Ubud's but cheaper. I think this is the only swing in Jatiluwih. I tried and it was fun!! Such amazing experince. Thank you!!","Nice restaurant with amazing views on Jatiluwih rice fields. Mainly local dishes, prices are very affordable (less than 300k IDR for the 3 of us)","Visited yesterday for lunch after reading positive reviews.
Situated on top of a hill to utilize the views there is many dining options both undercover and outdoors under umbrellas to take in the magnificent views.
The menu is quite basic featuring mainly local dishes there is isn't a lot of western choices.
We chose the mie goreng ayam and nasi goreng ayam plus a serve of chicken wings.
The chicken wings were quite spicy but very tasty and both the mie and nasi gorengs ok but I've had better.
The gardens here are lovely with ponds full of koi and plenty of tables that have great views.
Unfortunately we had to move undercover as a thunder storm came through.
Catavaca has real potential , I think they could improve on the food quality a little more and this outlet would be ideal.","As you enter the restaurant, you will be greeted with nice gate, statue, and decorations.
Then as you enter into your seats, you will have a vast view of paddy fields to please your sight. Their food is delicious too and I do recommend to try the local  pancake dessert called lak lak pisang (banana)."

That's a cool restaurant. I continued to go upstairs, and wow it's really cool in here. You can immediately see the barista making drinks. Also a beautiful statue of Dewi Saraswati. This spot is suitable for gathering with family or loved ones. You can eat or drink coffee, too. The bottom has bean bags if you want to lie down. I really understand this restaurant for those of us who want a lot. Hehe. There is also a stage if you want to make an event. Also quite a large yard. And, my friends and I chose to sit here. One by one the orders came! We ordered Fried Banana, Ice Cappuccino, Chicken Mushroom, Whole coconut, Seafood Fried Rice, Frozen Strawberry Daiqiri, and Fried Duck. Delicious dishes and cool atmosphere, make me hungry to finish everything. My favorites are Chicken Mushroom and Frozen Strawberry Daiqiri. This is me and my happy friends.

There is no internet at all...you have to walk up the road to the next homestay for access and food. The staff were very friendly though and the location is spectacular with rice terraces in front and a beautiful waterfall in back. But beware that you are not getting what you should be getting for this price. There are a lot better out there.","Pure Zen, absolutely breathtaking, it's just a fairy tale. Wow! If you are thinking of a trip to Jatiluwih, but the couple are hesitant because of the distance, you know that you will be rewarded rewardingly, given these terraces and walking its routes. A really excellent hotel and definitely beyond comparison with Tagallalang","A very dirty hotel, which is in a terrible condition. luckily we only had to spend one night here. the rooms were very dirty. the outdoor bath was not nice either.

Wi-Fi is not available in the entire hotel, although it is offered on the internet.

This hotel does not deserve a star.",Great place to visit...rice field on your door's step...,"Dirty, so dirty.. A lot a lot of insects"
