During our stay, we were amazed by the resort. Vegetations almost cover the entire place, and it feels like we live in the jungle.LOL

The room was spacious and had a bathtub that fit for two persons.

The staff were friendly and helpful (kudos to the security team). Plenty space for car park. Overall, it was amazing to stay here.

Lastly, I have to give it four stars as I was unpleasant moment during breakfast time. The breakfast menu did not have so many choices and a kind of repetition menu every day. The staff looks unresponsive and tends to serve foreign guests rather than locals.","One best resort that i ever stayed in Ubud. Stunning garden and pool, friendly staffs, many vegan food option really made me happy. Me and my wife have enjoyed the floating breakfast.. food were tasty and the tray decoration was lovely. superb!","I had a wonderful stay at The Mansion. It is like staying in a garden with swimming pools all over. Very quiet and relaxing. Good coffee, good food.
The staff is incredibly friendly!
If you want to travel into Ubud center, sometimes there was a lot of traffic.","Many beautiful photo spots in this resort. My wife was so happy during her stay here as she can took many photos for her social account. The room is so comfortable and we definitely have a good time. This resort is recomended for couple! Their raw vegan food is best, love it!","This resort has some beautiful spots to relax and beautiful photo spots. We really love the ambiances , especially the watery garden. There were two bamboo gazebos by the main garden with its couches that became my favourite area to read and enjoy some coffees.

It offers an opportunity to rejuvenate your body through food, providing a feeling of revitalization. I never imagined vegan cuisine could be this delicious. The use of fresh, local ingredients not only makes the dishes taste wonderful but also promotes health. If you're visiting Bali, I highly recommend experiencing this restaurant.","Maybe the best vegan meals I ever had.

Such an attention to every small detail, so many layers of flavours in all the meals. And superb service.

Suksma!","I recently visited Moksa after a few friends insisted I try this restaurant if I was ever in Ubud. My husband and I are vegetarian, so we were really excited to try a clean, fully vegan restaurant.

The restaurant is a little out of the way, but worth the extra time and effort. First glance at the menu, I will say it was a bit long and while there are so many options, it is a bit overwhelming.

Being that we were only going to be able to eat here once, we decided to go big and sample a large portion of their menu. Below I will list everything we tried and my thoughts:

Sushi Maki: I was not a fan of the sushi. While the presentation looked great, I was not a big fan of the jicama rice. It had a weird texture and taste (for reference, I do like jicama).

Herbed Cheese Ravioli: Another must try! This dish was my favorite! Absolutely delicious and you‚Äôd never know it was vegan!

Smashed avocado bruschetta: Had nice fresh tomatoes and a delicious pesto, however I was missing a crunch in the bread. The coconut bread was too chewy and one note with the avocado in my opinion.

Moksa Dhal: This is a must try!! This was my husbands favorite dish. Wonderful flavor, not salty, and craveable.

Moksa Sampler: I really enjoyed the mini lasagna and mini pizza, however I did not enjoy the other two items on the plate.

Ubud Souvlaki: I was not a fan, too chewy and hard to eat.

Tempeh ribs: These were okay, but didn‚Äôt wow me.

Coconut nice cream: I wasn‚Äôt getting much coconut flavor, I actually was tasting bubblegum which was odd. Not bad, but not what I was expecting.

Iced maca cappuccino: I enjoyed this drink, great flavor!

Overall, we had a great lunch sampling all the dishes. The presentation was nice on every dish and the service was great. My only recommendation is to reduce the menu and really hone in on perfecting the dishes. I absolutely love that they use fresh ingredients, many that are grown on the property. While my review may seem harsh, please note all the dishes were good, not great. Which is why I think they should limit the menu and deliver perfection on each dish.",The ambiance is amazing. The food is great and very tasty. And the desert is the best I ever ate! Plant based food and the ingredients are directly from the garden,"I‚Äôm certainly no vegan not even close to vegetarian, in day to day life the closest I come is having chips with my steak! However Moksa is one of my all time favourite restaurants. I come here every time I‚Äôm in Bali and it‚Äôs the only time I ever eat vegetarian. I even did a cooking class once with chef Made. The food is always ingeniously innovative and incredibly tasty high quality produce, organic and much sourced from their own permaculture gardens.  If I had my own personal chef who was capable of preparing Moksa‚Äôs menu, I could quite happily become full time vegetarian."

The atmosphere is not like eating in a normal restaurant, very calm, relaxing, like at home.

Andddd they were all very kind. One of our team's cell phones was left behind, and they were willing to keep it for a while - we insisted on giving them 'little appreciation' for their kindness, but unfortunately they didn't want to accept it.","Surprisingly good, what we love the most was the chicken. It's very juicy, tender, and tasty. It has smoky flavor that is delicious. All the dishes were light but well seasoned. The atmosphere is also very homey and peaceful, overlooking paddy fields with a lot of ducks.

Its authentic Balinese flavor, priced at 30k per portion. It's good that now they have QRIS available as a new payment method, not only cash.

Food was fab and had a great variety to choose from. I cannot compliment the staff enough. They had a very kind and friendly manner about them and made us feel so welcome and it was evident that they wanted their guests to have a great time. The cultural night was the highlight of our trip and the effort that was put into the experience was extraordinary. I attended the yoga that was on free of charge and it was fantastic. I also had a massage at the spa, used the steam room and the crystal healing room- all of which was a first class service. This resort is top class and I would highly recommend.","This hotel is really a special place if you want a quiet and peaceful place to stay. We rented a bungalow with private pool. There‚Äôs a lovely front porch to eat breakfast from and look out onto the rice terraces. All of the staff is very friendly. As noted by other reviewers, there is no way to drive a car directly to the hotel. There is a parking area/drop zone (which has a covered pavilion and seating) where you wait to get picked up by a small buggy (golf cart). The staff is very good at responding to WhatsApp and will send a buggy immediately at your request, even if it‚Äôs in the middle of the night. This hotel is a bit out of the way if you want to frequent the restaurants in the city center, but if you want a tranquil and quiet place to relax after a long day, I highly recommend this hotel.","This place was a great find. It was in a quiet area in the rice fields away from the hustle and bustle. It did take some time to get to town in the traffic but if you didn't want to head to town then you are sweet.
The rooms were large with a comfy bed. We had our own pool that was lovely to cool off in. The main pool was great as well to hang out with other guests.
Plenty of food places a small walk or golf buggy away.
Would defiantly go again.","This was our best stay in Bali. People (staff) here is excellent and doing an awesome job. I can write a whole page praising this place and the people. Me and my husband stayed here last week and below is our experience:

1. Place is amidst rice fields away from chaos and noise of the city and gives you a very calm and peaceful vibe.

2. They have buggies to pick and drop you to the main hotel from the hotel lobby which is near main road.

3. Rooms are clean and aesthetically designed and provides luxury with nature feel.

4. Food is delicious and I had one of the best meals of my vacations here. They have several options for vegan and vegetarian people which are both Healy and tasty too.

5. Breakfast and hi tea served here is great along with the service provided by the staff.

6. People are courteous and are always ready to help you.

7. They provide scooters for rent and you don‚Äôt need to go anywhere else to hire them.

8. I felt sad while leaving this place and will surely book this one when I am back to Bali.","Great resort with great view! at first I didn't know how this resort looks like but keep proposing it to my clients and all of them always like it. Few weeks ago I visited and wow it's really nice in terms of everything. The view is perfect, the room is made of traditional wood which make it very artistic. Staying here will make you feel like you are living in a small village. Not forget to mention how the rice paddies are planted right in front of the rooms."

The moment I stepped in, I was welcomed by a cozy and inviting atmosphere that instantly put me at ease. The menu here is a culinary delight, offering a wide variety of dishes, from delectable appetizers to scrumptious mains. What truly stood out for me were their cocktails - expertly crafted and bursting with flavor. And when it came to desserts, they didn't disappoint either.

The staff was friendly and attentive, adding to the overall pleasant experience.

I highly recommend this charming cafe to anyone visiting Ubud for a memorable dining experience.","Had the butter chicken with a couple of lime & mint granitas with a vodka shot for dinner. Both food and drinks were delicious. As it was close to where I was staying I went there for breakfast also. It too was great & I recommend it, is in that part of town.","Very good food, high quality. Not fancy but solid. Great service, albeit sometimes a bit slow. Favourite place for daily meal in Penestanan but there is a strong disadvantage - the smoking area is just outside and when someone smokes, all the smoke gets inside so staying inside is uncomfortable.

And after ten minutes of waiting for our order, when the waiter was sitting 5 meters from our table and the girl and the boy were chatting and showing videos on their phones, we gave up ... wasted time ... there plenty better restaurants around","Ubud Heaven Sayan Bali is not a good stay for a variety of reasons -
1. Too much mosquitoes & wildlife ( I saw lots of lizards and monitor lizards)
2. Service is slow. Some of the staff is very rude. They don‚Äôt entertain guests well. They operate on half information. Often feels like a trap talking to them
3. Food options are limited to 1 item per person for breakfast/floating breakfast.

I would not recommend staying here."

The interior is very beautiful. But the service could be better. The lady was friendly but nothing special. I was their only client in two weeks and i think if they would put the extra touch it would help them to become more popular. I had a club sandwich which was good. The frites where undercooked. Portion size is OK.,"I love this warung! This place is only 2 min by foot from our villa and we went twice in one day to have some food here.
We tried warung ting ting chicken - very crispy and delicious, pork ribs - also terrific, mie goreng chicken, nasi goreng seafood and sate ayam. Everything was very delicious and we enjoyed every bite.
The prices are low and portions aren‚Äôt too big, which might be a problem for someone, but you can easily order multiple dishes and try out Balinese cuisine at a very fair price.
The drinks are cheap, too.
Staff is very kind and polite, with a big smile on their face.
The waiting time for your food is medium - because they are preparing it fresh for you and if the restaurant if full you can wait a bit longer but order yourself a coconut and enjoy the splendid view over the temple next door. There is a free wifi and usually isn‚Äôt crowded so you can come to work here  as well.
We will be going there again today! No point in going to supermarkets and buying something to cook when you can have a delicious meal in a place like this with such good prices.

We were provided with a complimentary massage which is the best we had in this trip. They set up in one of the rooms, in the comfort of our own space. Thank you for organising.

Place is quiet and away from main area. We ordered food in mostly to save time and to enjoy the space. They provided ice for drinks and complimentary fruits too.","Its crazy! I love their two bedroom villa. Went there with my family. The swimming pool is sooo big that probably even better if its stayed for 6-8 people. The kitchen is so neat and clean white. I love the decoration and white minimalist style. The staff also really nice. The bed is super comfortable, but if there's a bath tub it would be perfect. I stay for 3 days, and each day they clean up the villa so totally satisfied. I def gonna back again!","Nice place but the pool lights was spoilt. Informed the manager, Gede but was dismissed irrationally & told that pool is still usable even without lights. Booked the villa for the ambience but didn‚Äôt turn out as expected. Villa should really look into replacing a more responsible manager.","Safe didn‚Äôt work but Villa is nice and clean.
Villa is not for family with small children because floor is very slippery and there are sharp edges almost everywhere (everything is from stone or marble).
10 min to Ubud centre by taxi. Not so many restaurants around.","Lovely little villa with a private pool and walls high enough to offer privacy.
The location is away from the busier side of Ubud and quite dark once night hits so make sure to bring a torch if you're waking around or hire a scooter from the staff as it'll make getting around a lot easier!
The staff are friendly and happy to help with anything you need.
It may be daunting when you first arrive as the complex itself is located behind the main street and you may miss the turn in if you arrive at night as we did.
Overall a great stay at great value!"

I came almost every day to get an iced coffee with a little note written on the cup. So cute. I never got the food, but it all looked so delicious. Also an amazing place to chill and get some work done.","I had a wonderful experience at Schauberger coffee this week.
I don't drink coffee so I am very particular with my matcha - theirs surpassed my expectations. It was pure matcha, so yummy with oat milk, and what was incredible was that the froth lasted for over an hour! That doesn't usually happen.
Not only did I enjoy one of the best matcha lattes I've ever had, I also experienced harmony, peace, joy - with the staff and just watching the staff (Kadek, Aton, and Sayur) have fun with one another, and a sense of community.

Highly recommend visiting this gem for anyone who's in Ubud üíö‚ò∫Ô∏è","It‚Äôs a busy cafe located on a quiet alley, staff were friendly and attentive, coffee was served neat.
I came with high expectations based on the good reviews, and having tried out various spots for decaf coffee, would have to say Schauberger‚Äôs was my least favourite by far. Maybe it would have tasted better with milk ‚Ä¶. mine was utterly bitter and left a burnt aftertaste I couldn‚Äôt finish it.","I have lived all around Bali, and this is by far the best coffee on the entire island, with the best staff ever! They make an effort to remember everyone's name and greet you with warm smiles.

The restaurant a few doors down is called Healthy Ubud and they are owned by the same people, so you can order from the restaurant and they will deliver it to the cafe, or visa versa.

Their desserts & pastries are beyond delicious, especially the toasted cinnamon bun and the carrot cake ü§©

They also have an assortment of teas and a wonderful beetroot latte!

If you're in Ubud, you must try their coffee, but be warned, you'll be hooked on this place and their goodies forever ü§§‚ù§Ô∏è

*Tip: get their fresh coconut milk, it's homemade and locally sourced!","The best matcha latte and regular latte I‚Äôve had in Ubud and ever üôà Super friendly and kind staff that make you feel like home.

Warning: this matcha is addictive - I‚Äôm having one almost every day üçµüíû"

As Room design is stylish, the pool water was unfortunately green color.
If you look for privacy, it may be suitable.","Beautiful collection of just six well-appointed villas in Sayan, very close to Ubud. The rooms are large and nicely decorated in Balinese style. Bathrooms are huge and semi open-air, making them quite unique compared to homes in the West. The highlight of course is that each villa has its own private pool, which is a godsend to cool down from the omnipresent heat and humidity. Staff are very friendly and helpful and there are several restaurants nearby within walking distance. Take note though that there is a chicken farm next door, so you will hear them early every morning. I didn't mind but if you like to sleep in late in peace, you've been warned. Loved this place!"

Ubud's original celebrity hideout is as casually authentic and gorgeously chic as it was when Bowie, Jagger and Tom Ford stayed here. Don't miss the hotel boutique which sells original, high-quality designer threads. Stunning views. Amazing artisan wooden bungalows. Wonderful staff.","Loved visiting the new addition to Taman Bebek's charm. A space where you can enjoy a special meal, flip through Made Wijaya's books, listen to good music and try on special clothing pieces made of antique fabrics. Totally worth checking out!","Finding this place was the difference between a good holiday and an unforgettable one. The story behind Taman Bebek and the man who created it, together with his writings, took my visit to another level.

The gardens, villas, service, pool, and location are all great, but if you dive into the Bali Made Wijaya writes about and the story of his life, it will add another dimension to your Bali holiday.

Don't be put off by old reviews - the rooms have been carefully maintained and refreshed since then. If anything you might wish for a few more food choices on site, but I think this will come with time.

Highly recommended for anyone who loves nature, culture, design, and a good story.","My partner and I have been coming to ubud for the past couple of years. Taman Bebek is always the place we come back to. There is no other property like this is Ubud, this Iconic hotel has hosted the coolest artists and alike since the 70‚Äôs and its look and feel still carries the legacy of the epoch.
The views are the best in Ubud and sunsets can be breath taking. The staff is always attentive and have helped us with anything we need in terms of rooms service and also anything we might need in terms of logistics.
The rooms are always well cleaned, super spacious and confortable and beautifully decorated. Taman Bebek is certainly for those who appreciate nature, art and a cultural legacy. Better said, those who appreciate good things in life :)","Stayed here in September of 2022. The place has a beautiful view and well kept grounds. The house was nice but had lots of gaps under the doors so you need to be ok with animals and bugs if you're going to stay here (for example there was a frog on our bed when we checked in). This was not a huge problem for us as we had read similar reviews before staying. The house had really dim lighting and shaded windows so it was really hard to see anything during the day or night. There were also cameras placed in trees all over the property. I really hated this, especially since the shower and bathroom were outside. The property is also not owned by a local, if that is important to you. It is owned by a French guy who was honestly pretty rude to his Balinese workers.
The reason for the two stars is that:

1. The house was extremely overpriced compared to similar ones in the same area. Breakfast is not included if you book on airbnb and if you ask for it they overcharge you for it.

2. Our check out time was at 12pm marked in two different places on airbnb. We were leaving that day and arranged to be picked up by a taxi at 12pm. The staff was knocking on the door and trying to come in to clean starting at 10:30 am and continued to knock/try to come in every 10 minutes until 12pm. We were showering, changing and packing during this time which made it super uncomfortable to have a bunch of men standing on the porch, looking through the windows and trying to come in.

3. After we left at 12pm and made our way to the airport one of the workers called my partner and accused us of taking a book from the house.. We never touched their books and definitely wouldn't ever take something from a rental. Nothing ever came of this after the phone call but this was pretty insulting.

We booked this place because we wanted to ""splurge"" on something nice for our last couple of days. This ended up being the worst place we stayed at during our trip and was the most expensive by a lot. The property has a lot of potential but is not managed well. I would not recommend."

Our house is simply destroyed by termites - there is no piece from the bed, every piece of furniture is in holes and crumbs from wood are constantly falling from the ceiling and from the bed.

The staff is very nice, like all Indonesians, but they clean more for visibility - very superficially.

The team are so friendly and accomodating, the villa is so relaxing, the surrounds are beautiful, the food is delicious, the massage with Jenny is sensational.
Definitely want to come back here. One of the few places that is better than the pictures.
It was also baby safe (we have a 16 month old), we just stayed with her when she was near the villa pool.
Thank you for having us üôè","Great place for its value. However, the location is not ideal for families. Very critical point that bathroom is outside!!

For couples who like to walk, it is fine because you have to walk at least 20 minutes to get to UBUD center. Rooms are huge and pool is beautiful. Downside: rooms are not completely private; I was shocked that I can‚Äôt lock the villa from outside. It was crazy for me.

Rooms are well maintained with good shower and bed and are aesthetically a pleasing place to be, especially with your own pool! Breakfast was delicious and of a high standard, made fresh everyday. I thought the position of Villa Nirvana was excellent too, peaceful and relatively quiet, but close enough to a good supermarket and plenty of local restaurants and attractions.

The people of Mangku guesthouse are amazing. Very friendly, flexible and honoring your breakfast requests. The rooms are clean and tidy with good airconditioning. The bathroom could use some renovations but nothing which negatively impacted our stay.

We had a great stay here and will definitely come back!","A clean guest house with spacious rooms. The room is equipped with a case, a/c, a large balcony. Breakfast is served in the balcony (7-11 am), consisting of a fruit plate, juice and an egg meal. Rooms were clean, the bathroom was pretty spacious as well.

It was nice to be staying outside of Ubud, but only a short scooter ride away. Clean room, big bed, good air-con and fantastic breakfast included in the super cheap price! And if you want a swim in the pool their other accommodation is only a short walk away. Would recommend. Maybe not so good if you have trouble walking or use a wheelchair.
