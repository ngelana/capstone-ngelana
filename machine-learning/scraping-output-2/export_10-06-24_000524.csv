Absolutely delicious food. I've never eaten such tasty fish. All fresh and made in-house. Recommended to you.,"We are tourists from Australia, staying a short walk away in a hotel. In three weeks of travelling through Bali this was hands down the best meals we have had!!  We had grilled fresh fish and chicken cooked the traditional Balinese way (out the back on a fired grill), and whoa it was so so good!  The menu is designed for locals and so it avoids the standard westernised items we have seen everywhere and it actually has some flavour! The owner and staff speak excellent English and so helped us to translate the menu and choose what to eat, and also we had a great chat about how the food is made etc.   lovely space and lovely people. we highly recommend this restaurant - especially for tourists!  It was so good getting away from the hotel bland food and having an awesome night just up the road!","Soooo delicious, I recommend the grilled fish, it's freshly barbecued out back and the marinade is incredible. Really lovely people as well , great value and a calm spot away from the busy main road.",Great place to have a bite. The food was delicious and the staff was very helpful. The owner is a great guy!,
