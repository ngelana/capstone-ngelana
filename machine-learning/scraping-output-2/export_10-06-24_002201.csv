BUT it was worth the wait! I ordered Beef&Bacon, Cheesy Chicken and Dirty Fries. Everything was perfect, the portion, the taste, the meat‚≠êÔ∏è Just suggest to give lil' bit ketchup to dip the burger. Better to come here on weekdays or you can arrive at 2 pm sharp to avoid a long waiting","Have wanted to check Mojos Burger since they are big in tiktok for a while, but I was afraid with the queue. We wait for almost 90 minutes on the rain and there were about 10 people infront of us. Anyway the food was amazing, the bill came and it was quite cheap. Definately worth a visit, however I certainly wouldn't wait out in the cold for ages just to get in.","The best are chicken wings, chili con carne on top of the fries is great, and for burgers I recommend you to order the beef & bacon.

Waited almost 3 hours, it would be more delicious if the food served was still warm ‚ù§Ô∏è","best burger with affordable price!!

waiting for one hour to get this but totally worth it.","Hidden gem burger near Margarana. It‚Äôs really affordable with delicious beef burger and bacon. Love the bun too! Surprisingly, the chili beef burger is the best! Will be back to try their another menu ü•∞

Ps: worth the queue üòú"
