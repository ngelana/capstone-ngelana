Ate a lot of different food. Came through quickly the next day but may have been the coconut earlier or the extra heat I asked for. Either way a good experience at the night market that I will not forget.,"Brought here personally by my tour guide who needed to help us order food.
Had dinner here
Wide range of food available. From nasi to satay to desserts.
Local price. Very cheap and tasty. Per pax up to 15k for great portion. Possible to do some shopping at very low price.","It is a traditional food and clothing market.
Mainly frequented by locals and with very few foreign visitors. Here you can taste real Indonesian food. I recommend the visit",Great night market full of good food and stuff to buy! Nice to be with locals only and not touristy restaurants,Largest night market we've been to in Bali. Came the times in a week and more stalls each time. Multiple srombotan stalls. Best one was in the corner with seating behind it.  All was for 5k. Satay of fish in the middle was quite nice but the pork belly was only ok. Lamb satay on the outside road was really nice. Ordered 20 by mistake but enjoyed it all. Boiled peanuts also available at the market.

Centrally located near the Gianyar city center. The rooms and public areas are clean. The only reason I'm giving this review four stars is because the annoying front desk kept calling to remind me to vacate the room before 12. Called several times. I find that a bit intruding. When we confirm to check out before 12, that means we will.","Doesn‚Äôt feel clean. Had suspicion sheets weren‚Äôt freshly washed. Woke up itchy. Maybe bed bugs. At first air con didn‚Äôt work, but front desk guy fixed quick enough. Place smelled.

If you check-in early or check-out late, they will charged extra 30% to 50% the regular price (as I read on their policy at check-in desk).

The bedsheet and blanket were smelly and I spotted some blood stain on it.
At first I didn't notice and got itchy. I asked for changing and they changed the new set for us.

The room have bed light, TV, AC, closet, and clothes hanger, free wifi, a pool, and eating area. The room isn't soundproof, and they don't have scooter rental or laundry service.

The location is good to explore night market. Unfortunately we couldn't go see waterfall because of the heavy rain (it's July but there are raining a lot).

Gianyar doesn't have many activities so it's quite boring in my opinion.","Very dirty, linens looks like not been washed for a long time, the room is smelly and the bathroom is very dirty",Good room for the price. Wouldn‚Äôt have expected any more. The bathroom wasn‚Äôt super clean but okay. Very nice and helpful staff. Great location. Close to a few waterfalls like Kanto lampo.
