ChIJF2q7JHT10S0RSqma9bz2TLU,La Fresa Kintamani,-8.2822661,115.3069469,"Belancan, Kintamani, Bangli Regency, Bali, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=13064087910529804618,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-1217-1561,tourist_attraction,tourist_attraction,4.3,242,,"Amazing place with a cafe and flower fields , good for pictures. A bunny and a parrot might be attractive for children.
Beverages and snakes you can have in a cafe.
Big area with strawberries you can pick up.
35k and complimentary sneak for the entrance and everything you pick you pay for the weight. 250r per kg.
Strawberry ichigo is a Japanese one, very strong aroma and sweet!
Welcoming staff. Gave me a berry to try and strawberry wine feels more like a vinegar.
Definitely worth to visit!!!","The price for strawberry picking is Rp.35k, quite reasonable since it comes with a snack of your choice as well. I was there when it's not the harvest season yet so I didn't get that many strawberries, but still, the picking experience was so fun and I wasn't being watched at all.
After picking, I got to the flower fields nearby where they have lavenders, sunflowers and daisies. They are beautiful and makes for great photo spots. Overall, this is a nice, relaxing tourist destination.","it was pretty, the atmosphere was comfy, windy, calming. the best place to spend your weekend doing nothing! i love the dried strawberry coated with white chocolate they gave included in the entrance ticket (so deli i had to buy 2 packs more for myself!)

however, one thing that i'd love la fressa to take care of is the bunny cage. please make the gate more proper so the bunny didnt escape easily. please give them more food like dried timothy hay for them to munch while waiting for customer feeding time. i hope la fressa will consider this feedback! thank you!","recommend! went with my 5yo and 3yo. they would provide a small scissor and basket for each kid, no additional cost besides the entrance ticket and strawberries picked are paid by weight. staff selling ticket is polite and smiley. unlike other reviews i didnâ€™t get watched or stalked at by staff at all during strawberry picking, nobody was watching us!  although now is replanting season we are still able to pick a bonnet full of strawberries. place is well kept and has a sink with soap for handwashing. flowers alongside is pretty but not much. some nice purple flowers and only 2 sunflowers surviving in Dec, not an issue for us though as we were there for strawberries","It's good for people that like gardening.
But not for me, nothing to do here except to drink coffee.
You can go around in the plant and flower field for 35k rupiah entrance ticket that can be changed to drink / others.
To pick strawberry the price are 250K Rupiah per kilo.
Cheap place to go as long as not about stawberry"
