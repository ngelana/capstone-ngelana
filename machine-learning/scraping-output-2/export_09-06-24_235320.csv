Putu and Nengah are so nice and welcoming!! It has beautiful little rooms and a terrace with an amazing view over ricefields and the mount agung! We also recommend to eat all your food at the Homestay since Nengah cooked the most delicious food weâ€™ve had so far too! Putu also took us to a trekking tour through the jungle and we learned so much about the plants and ate so many fruits that just grew next to our way!! So we really recommend asking him about tours through the area with him! The room was so clean and flooded with light from all sides with a very comfortable bed! Highly recommended!!!,Had a wonderful two night stay with family. Putu and Gede were exceptional hosts and happily took care of any requests. We enjoyed a jungle walk/temple visit and a tour of the farm. Scooters were arranged for us as well as laundry. Food was excellent and they were truly welcoming. Paradise.,"My favourite place in Bali. Just the sounds of nature. I spent 5 days watching the birds and butterflies and the gorgeous sunrise. Putu drove me with his scooter anywhere I wanted and Angah cooked beautiful meals. Great banana pancake and other delicacies for my sweet tooth.
The room is comfortable, clean and light. And most of all, great views over Mount Agung, the rice paddies, and the mountains. From there, I visited a temple, hotsprings, the Jatiluwih rice paddies. Putu also showed me the farm with all various fruits, vegetables and spices. I learned a lot. I will be back, for sure.","I am truly happy that I chose to stay at putu and his wife's little house for a couple nights.
My flight was a late arrival and it took me almost 2 hours from the airport to his homestay. But I do not regret at all. He greeted me even it was almost 10pm. He let me settle down quickly and I told him if he has any food as I didn't have my dinner on the plane. He said his wife can cook for me. The food was delicious with love and the house was very spacious, cozy, clean and contemporary designed by his architect cousin. I had a very good night there and in the morning I could see the sunrise just from the big balcony windows and doors. The view was specular amazing and I would not get tired at all by just seeing how beautiful the rice fields and the land is. Breakfast or reading at the outside table was also amazing and full of love by the nature. And I didn't even get any mosquito bites at all surprisingly.
The next day he offered to show me around to the rice field farm, the amazing waterfalls, I asked him what the local would eat and he brought me to a very local place for lunch. And finally he brought me to the hotspring. I also enjoyed very much.
After we were back to his house. He walked me his farm and I walked with my bare feel to feel the earth and mother nature. He also shared some of his fruit trees, ranbutans, white mango, the best sweetness passion fruit I have ever tried. Mother nature has brought his family and bali people so much treasure and he would love to share what he had growed. He even gave me a small pack of rice which grow from his land. I would highly recommend his place to anyone who wants a quiet place to enjoy a peaceful, calm vacation.
May all of his family and land be blissful, happy and peaceful in lovely bali. Thankyou Putu and his family and relatives. Being so helpful and friendly.","One of the best accommodations of Bali! Relaxing atmosphere in the nature and
friendly and calm people. They have a big variety of fruits and food which is delicious and affordable/cheap. The rooms are quiet and very clean. To visit close by temple, waterfalls and rice fields I would advise a scooterðŸ˜‰"

Everything was perfect, the rooms were cosy and s clean and the owners were super friendly and kind. Highly recommended!","great house.  it is located away from the road and being here you are in complete solitude with nature.  many sounds of insects and birds are heard.  the place is truly magical.  the balcony offers a breathtaking view of the rice fields that you can admire with a cup of coffee.  there is coffee and tea in the house, hot water in the bathroom.  our stay here was great, we will gladly return.",The tiny house is lovely and the view is awesome.
