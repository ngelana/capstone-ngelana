There are some local seller of fruits and vegetables here, they're harvesting fresh from the garden and sell it in a cheap price.

This is a good place for you to strolling. The area is clean.

But this is not too huge place, bcs you only need about 25 minutes to get around rice fields and back to start.

Recommended to bring your pet here","Jogging with wonderful view, you can find vegie and also cafe here. The track also already good for us to jogging. Nice place","One of the most favorite jogging park among locals, it has really nice views along the way and quite moderate track about 30 minutes from starting point back to starting point again. There are some warung and caf√© located at various spot. Definitely worth a try","a good and fresh place to see a greenery in the city.
there are lots of local vendors selling snacks, vegetables and fresh fruits they grow themselves, really a great place to hangout with only paying 2000 rupiahs for parking",Another jogging track with ricefield view in the heart of Denpasar. Relaxing ambience with the sound of waters flowing and birds chirping. No entry and parking fee. Less crowded than Prapat Beris Jogging Track in Sanur.

Even up to this day I can still imagine how good it tasted. The other dishes are okay for my taste. But I like the idea of incorporating strawberries to different dishes. It‚Äôs quite unique. They have more local style but it‚Äôs good. The prices are affordable. Highly recommended and please try the pancakes ü•û,"I didn't expect that the combination of strawberry in the salad (and other foods) will be that good. Good foods, good place, good atmosphere. Recommended üëçüèª","We accidentally discovered this place when the roads were closes due to a ceremony. So glad we did!! My daughter and I love the strawberry pancakes, strawberry croissants, strawberry cheesecake and the strawberry juice and yakult. Very good price and great food. We'll be back!","If you're into strawberries, this place will fit you.

Their ice strawberry coffee was like a cozy hug for my taste buds, mixing strawberry goodness with my caffeine fix.

Pizza strawberry is a thing, and it's good! The classic pizza meets strawberries in a surprising unique flavors that worked.

Plus, the staff were so friendly, making the visit even better. If you're up for a unique and tasty experience, Strawberryku's strawberry-themed menu and awesome service are a must-try.

FYI, they also have a socket, so you are actually able to work from here :)","good for children, kinda hot with the glass windows but spacious enough for party.
strawberry is their specialty ... many kinds of drinks from strawberry and you can ask no sugar added ..."
