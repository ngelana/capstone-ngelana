Decent food, they mostly offer mushroom menu. I tried lawar jamur and jamur crispy. I like the jamur crispy. It's a decent place. Toilet clean. Try if you are around. They produce kerupuk from chicken bones it's unique tho. The nasi goreng and the lawar jamur is a bit too salty. Parking is easy. Huge place to park the car. They could improve a lot... #OFR","Crazy cheap eating experience. This is thematic restaurant where they uses oyster mushroom as their main ingredient, even for dessert. Foods were decent and extremely affordable, it is indeed a little hidden gem for those who dare to explore.","This place is for you who love mushroom so much, there are much food with mushroom base like meatball, noodle, ice and many more. The place is so good near a rice field with some windy. Price is cheap enough, but the taste is so good. I recommend you to eat hereüëå","An absolute gold mine of a Warung specialising in Mushroom dishes! Everything on the menue is mushroom based. The highlight is the mushroom sat√© (Sate Jamur) combined with nasi goreng or the mushroom soup (Sop Jamur). If you are adventurous try the mushroom juice (Jus Jamur) - a coconut based milkshake with shredded mushrooms that is sweet in taste.  The mushrooms are high quality, mainly shitake and oyster mushrooms. The sitting area is quiet with your personal Pagoda atop a small carp pond.","This is my favorit place to it a creative mushroom dish. Price are so affordable. Once you come to this place , you will never forget about it"

Just staring at me, even after saying hello... I pick up the menu, and still no reaction. So strange.

I ordered vegetarian Nasi Goreng + Telur. My portion is much smaller than others, like child-sized. I can hear younger girl snicker as she walks away.

Food taste is average.
(kind of tastes like instant Mie Goreng spice packet)
Not polite.
I hate their attitude.

I will go elsewhere.","Very good food, mosty with mushrooms
Nice place to seat on the river.",The taste is very good with a great view of fieldrice,Offering a good & healthy food with very good price.,
