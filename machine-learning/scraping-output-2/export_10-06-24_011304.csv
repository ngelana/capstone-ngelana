I only booked here because of issues with my previous booking, but let me tell you, it's nothing like the photos depict.

Upon arrival, they didn't bother to ask for my documents, just glanced at my booking and ushered us into some random room, despite booking a deluxe one. And let's talk about that room‚Äîit was a nightmare! We discovered a gecko behind the table, and when we asked the staff to remove it, they responded rudely. After a while, they claimed to have taken care of it, but lo and behold, we found it under the bed! When we called them out again, they behaved aggressively and started ranting in their language. And that's not all‚Äîwe found another one behind the curtain! Each time we asked for help, they mocked us and behaved disgustingly.

The room doors were a joke‚Äîthey were sliding doors that didn't even close properly. And don't get me started on the TV‚Äîit didn't work!

As for the breakfast we booked, it was a joke. Despite the menu boasting numerous options, the manager insisted most items were payable. With the ""free"" breakfast, we were limited to either an omelet or a banana pancake. As a strict vegetarian, I opted for the pancakes, only to find out they tasted like omelet, clearly cooked in the same pan!

When we complained, the manager made faces and mocked us, saying, ""gecko gecko gecko‚Ä¶"" as if it was a joke!

This was by far the worst experience of my life. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy!

The only upside is that Kelingking Beach is a 5-minute walk away.","Had a great stay at this hotel. Room was nice and clean, location was amazing and beautiful, and the staff were excellent and very helpful. There is also a restaurant and a store to buy snacks and other necessities. The pool was also well maintained, with a great view. Highly recommend this hotel - would definitely have no problem staying here again in Nusa Penida.","Overall it was an okay stay. Great location and it‚Äôs very close from the Kelingking Beach. Mattress and AC were also pretty new. Upon checking in, the staff didn‚Äôt check our passports or identity cards, they only told us to write our name on a book. Moreover, the staff asked us repeatedly when we were checking out as if they had no clue about their hotel‚Äôs reservations. It‚Äôs dangerous for a business because whoever can come by and stay in the hotel.

However, we had to check out earlier because I had meeting appointments and the internet connection and electricity were not reliable. WiFi connection was off on our first day (the staff said the whole island was affected but we went to two nearby restaurants and they had WiFi) and there was bad if not, no service around Kelingking area. Every evening there were 2-3 times power outages and the water pump in the bathroom didn‚Äôt work because of that. There were 6 times power outages between 8 AM to 1 PM on the 3rd day we were there and only the AC that was turned on. Nothing was charged and the light was off. So they need to fix this electricity problem.","I don't recommended to anyone. Rooms are super smelly, if you have allergy or breathing problems avoid staying here. Everything is old, towels are torn and yellowish. Washrooms feel never been deep clean. Consistant power outage.","This is a budget hotel. Please dont expect extreme hygiene and service. It is decent enough if you want to just sleep here for the night. There are many nearby hotels but the price is double. You get what you pay for. For me it was a decent stay. Just like no one wears seatbelt and helmets in nusa penida. no one checks identity cards here.

One of the only reason to book this is if you want to visit T-Rex ü¶ñ beach in the morning. Which is why I booked this hotel."

Tried their nasi goreng with chicken satay, their satay tastes so good and tender, the peanut sauce also tastes delicious but their nasi goreng has common taste nothing special.","My wife and I ate lunch here earlier today and had the garden salad, club sandwich and friend noodles. Overall, the food was very mediocre. There were only 2 very small pieces of chicken in the entire fried noodle dish. In fact, in the entire fried noodles, it was just noodle, despite the menu saying there would be some vegetables too. The piece of chicken in the club sandwich was also tiny, but the sandwich was tasty and the fried potatoes with it were good. The lemon dressing for the garden salad was very tasty. However, the service was excellent - quick and friendly. And the restaurant vibe was very nice, perched atop a breezy hill with a nice outdoor patio space. I am not sure that I would ever return and I am not sure what prompted all of these 5 star reviews.","The food was decent nothing amazing, but nothing bad either.

The service was bit slow, but the staff were friendly. Overall, it was an okay experience.","The drink prefect

Loved the bungalows, the pool area, the ability to rent scooters and drive around the beautiful Nusa Penida! But the staff absolutely made this trip for us, so helpful and so much fun to be around! Thank you for a brilliant stay!

If you are in the area we would highly recommend trekking down to Klingking beach (even though it is super difficult - wear trainers) and would also recommend a meal at Warung Madeva (5 mins walk away).","In the beginning, wanted Kelingking Mesari but all sold out.

Pros:
- This bungalow run by young friendly staffs.
- Environment wise is nice & quiet.
- Total 7 units of bungalows here.
- No mosquitoes

Cons:
Assigned to Rm no.3
- Oily flooring.
- Aircon not cool.
- Look at the desk knob. OMG
- Power supply keeps tripping due to power surge from lightings & aircon. Called reception 2x to rectify. Confronted them if tripped again we insisted on changing to another villa at their cost.
- I took initiative to switch off the lightings since outdoor still bright & sunny. From there on, no tripped. Balanced out power shortage.
- Starting 5am can hear lotsa rooster crowing.
- Door latch not swift & smooth.
- Corroded faucet.
- No cotton slippers.

I would say it‚Äôs a matter of luck which room you are assigned to. More cons than pro. I believed this bungalow used to be tip top condition when it just opened.

I‚Äôm kind enough to rate 3 stars because I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs time to upgrade these bungalows. If u upgrade nicely, surely will attract more tourists demand.","Hidden gem in nusa! Loved the little huts, but loved the outdoor pool in the middle of the jungle even more. Can swim and see the stars at night. Nusa is a super relaxing island too, wish I stayed here longer","Food took quite a long time to make, juices watery,  Staff claimed 5% more when paying by card refusing to show any proof of bank charges.  Overall quote rude behaviour.","The place is at walkable distance to the Kelingking beach, good service, decent swimming pool to wear off the tiredness post trek. They provide pickup/drop services too. We had a great time there."

Somehow still spotted & greeted by their staff.

Can‚Äôt judge much about this place bcoz I haven‚Äôt stayed in here before.
Initially wanted this villa but all fully booked.
Must be popular & good.

Besides only a few units villa available. Down side is only its reception is kinda old school makeshift.

Anyway according to them new units will available by next year to cater more guests. Will pay a visit again next year probably :)","Very nice place to stay, they are building new houses.
We had no issues, very kind people and the food was great as well !
And 5minutes from Kelingking viewpoint, that was stunning.","This place is scary!! I was too afraid to stay there.. No lights on road, very dark and quiet ..

-Hotel is still under construction
-Only 4rooms they have
-pool is great, very deep
-broken toilet cover
-broken door
-electricity gone at night 3.30am
-AC needs time to cool , felt very hot

Overall big NO for families, couples.. just one thing-location is great .. very near to kelingking beach to enjoy sunset.. but apart from this this place seems very scary to me..","The place is very dirty, a lot of mold and dust, spider webs, unsanitary bathroom and overall a beat up place. The surrounding area around the pool is dirty and you can see trash laying around(it would take the staff 15 minutes to gather). The place had construction going on, it was very dissapointing to hear and see an entire site going on, not a romantic place at all. You can also hear an ongoing sound of a rooster and pig squeaking every morning through the day. The finishes of the construction are very poor and it isn‚Äôt worth the price we paid for (3 nights, 180‚Ç¨).

The only good thing is the close proximity to Kellyking beach but you have other better options in Nusa Penida.","We loved this little wooden house, very close to the famous Kelingking beach that we wanted to visit, so that was a huge bonus for us. The staff was also really nice and helpful. They prepare tasty food for you if you request.
The bathroom needs some sort of ventilation.
The doors needs fixing, you can barely open them, it makes such an unbearable noise.
The rest is great though."

Stopped by for a late lunch at 3pm, had TWO yummy dishes, had a great chat with the owner Asta (sorry if I spelled your name wrong), went hiking and swimming at Kelingking beach, came back for dinner at 6pm.
Asta and his female colleague (sorry I didn't get your name) were so friendly and hospitable and spoke great English.
Food is HOT, yummy and priced so reasonably.
I had the signature dish Ayam Baker (grilled chicken leg with homemade sauce). The grilled tuna was also the best grilled tuna I have had compared to the Philippines and Viet Nam.
Wait time might be a tiny bit long when there are more than 01 guest. And there are mosquitoes. But the quality is worth it.
Local dishes made with care. Skip those tour package restaurants and go here instead!Highly recommended!",One of the best food we had in Bali! This hidden gem should receive more recognition. The owners couple are very friendly and knowledgeable. A little bit on the downside was that the place located near a busy intersection and probably that‚Äôs why get overlooked often. Would definitely go back here if have a chance,Best Nasi Goreng I've tasted in Indonesia! The service is amazing. Very lovely people. They cook with their own coconut oil. I ate every day while in the island!,It's a family owned resturant. They  are super nice and friendly. He explained the menu with passion. The food that his wife made were fresh with amazing taste.,"A 10/10 experience. The service was exceptional, the Grilled Tuna dish was amazing and my husbands spring rolls were beautiful. The salad and sambal that accompanied my grilled tuna were insanely good. Very reasonably priced and the best place I‚Äôve eaten in Nusa Penida"
