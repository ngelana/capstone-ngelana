Food was okay, presentable breakfast but we had to choose from the menu and it was not breakfast buffet. Overall great stay!
This place is near Crystal Bay Beach takes 5-6 min by bike from the hotel. They also provide rental bike for a good price, petrol and buggy car ride for extra cost.
Also, there were so many lizards [5 at once] right out of our room.","Location-wise it's not directly in front of a beach. It was located on the street leading to Crystal Beach.

I stayed here 2 nights in September for this years's Bali trip with my family.

Room amenities were okay. But it can be better, if there are several towels provided. At least one or two small handtowels for hand drying.
We only got bath towels during our stay.
We got two small bottled waters. But if you want it to be environment-friendly, it will be better if only one big bottle provided.

The pool is adequate for such a hotel this size.

The Staffs are friendly.","Located between Crystal Beach ana Harbour make the place so strategic. Great atmosphere on the resort with large room and bathroom.

Clean room and pool is guaranteed, cons is ants/insect sometimes shown in balcony but totally normal considering the nature environment. Pool is 1.8m depth so suitable for local/foreigners.

Breakfast is amazing, you can choose 1 food and 1 drink but the taste is so authentic. Order Brekie breakfast and Nusa Penida breakfast, Nusa Penida breakfast is recommended who love toast, poached egg, mushroom and cheese, brekie breakfast for anyone like suasage, omelette and bacon

Won't hesitate to visit the resort again","Overall it was a nice stay, me and my family spent 5 days there and have no complaints. Rooms are clean, staff is very friendly and food is also nice.
The only thing is the shower hose which could be replaced with a new one.
There isn't really much sun on the swimming pool so the water can be quite cold.","It is a nice hotel with a good restaurant and friendly staff.

They offer east and west travel packages as shown in the picture (private tours for 2 people) and packages that go to both places within a day for 1,000,000 IDR.

The price of snorkeling is per person.

Accommodation pick-up service was free at the port, but port drop-off service at the property was charged 150,000 IDR.

During my stay at the accommodation, I visited the hospital due to a high fever and provided a round-trip car service for 250,000 IDR (reasonable price)

It doesn't matter when you pay with cash, but there is a 3% extra charge when you pay by card.

The accommodation was in good condition overall, but sometimes cockroaches come out, and the water pressure is so weak that I think it's ridiculous."

Even though the location is quite remote and the road infrastructure is inadequate, it is paid off by the hotel's location with access to beautiful sunsets.  We took a villa with 3 bedrooms.  Spacious, quite clean but the service is not very prompt.  Initiative is somewhat lacking.  Toilleterie facilities (toothbrush, cottonbut...) are not available for boutique villas and  the price is quite expensive for us.  Good food, we enjoyed breakfast and dinner at the hotel.","The hotel is beautiful. We had our own little bungalow with four poster bed. The views are stunning and breath taking. The infinity pool has the best views. Breakfast was delicious and the restaurant area again has a gorgeous setting. Staff are very respectful and attentive.
We would delfinelty come back as soon as you enter the hotel you feel relaxed and want to stay longer.

The touches for my birthday were beautiful. They really go the extra mile.","Two things we liked about the hotel was the really lovely staff, very intentive and always ready to help, very friendly and sweet, also The Pool area and the view was beautiful but unfortunately that the only two things that were nice about this property.

The road to the property was extreamly bumpy and uncomfortable, especially on the scooter. The Hotel in general wasn't clean or well kept. The rooms seems nice in the pictures but unfortunately they don't show the dust, the spider webs and dead insect all around the room. The whole ""house"" has wholes, cracks and openings everywhere, all the insects and gekos easily getting inside every night inside. The bathrooms also has big openings everywhere that besides insects also won't leave with any privacy. The water preasure is weak and is heated by a boiler so hot water has a limit and we ended up with cold shower a few times. The windows have see through blinds/curtains that ppl that are in the pool or passing through can see everything in the room that I had to ask for extra towels just so I can hang them to cover the windows. The main door to the house has a padlock to close the doors and the entire system is really fragile that it acctully makes is really easy to open up the door. The experience overall was really unpleasant and uncomfortable as it leved us worried about the higine, animals coming in, the privacy and our safety.","Very friendly staff! Really want to help you with everything. We had a small issue with rental scooter (rent at the place) which eventually got sorted out nicely.

A place with a beautiful view and some great food. Simple but good and nice breakfast.

Do know you sleep in the middle of nature. This is awesome, but at the same time there could be some weird insects in the room. Nothing to worry about because they are harmless and there is a good mosquito net.","POSITIVE
-	The staff was very friendly
-	We had a spacious room with traditional furniture.
-	The food at the restaurant for breakfast and dinner was quite good for the most part

NEGATIVE
General:
-	The road to the hotel is bumpy and dangerous
-	Garbage everywhere: rotting leaves and branches on the ground; rubbish and empty bottles stored in guests’ sight, building materials, broken tiles and cans of varnish under open staircase; bottle caps next to the pool (not disposed of for 3 days). Pool always opaque. Staff’s dog drank from and swam in the pool
-	Staff are limited by language skills, and lack of professional training and of management
-	Frequently, an older man sat on the restaurant floor and smoked for hours, with his torso exposed
-	Transportation arranged by hotel is overpriced by c.30-40%
Room
-	No normal door lock, only a pad lock, which leaves a 10cm gap
-	Cobwebs all over the place, dead insects piled up on power outlets
-	Towels had large, brown stains (size of a fist). The mosquito net had holes, stains and dead insects
-	No minibar, no safe. Only 1 bottle of complimentary water per day (all other hotels where we stayed in Bali at a similar price point offered free water for brushing your teeth, etc.)
-	Water in shower and toilet supplied by a water tank next to the wall and makes an unbearably loud humming noise (heard throughout most of the compound). Still, water pressure in the shower is very low. Pump broken twice so we could not use shower/toilet for several hours!
-	Due to the open concept (bathroom with open ceiling, 50cm gap between the windows and the ceiling) you’ll hear anything: your partner going to the bathroom, the water pump, neighbours coughing all night, teenagers partying next door
-	Only thin, white curtains and the sunlight will wake you up at 6:00-6:30am
Restaurant
-	Plates are small. For the breakfast “included” in the room rate, we got only one cup of coffee/tea and one small plate, which left us hungry. Additional charge for more plates/juices (we were only told before departure)
-	On average we waited 45min for food – even if you inform them the day before of an intended departure time

Overall, we feel that value for money is very poor. A bit of interior design and a colourful smoothie bowl alone don’t qualify for a great experience. We’ve stayed at hotels of a similar price point both in Bali, other parts of Asia and Europe, with a significantly better and more professional experience. If only we had known before: We could not help but to feel ripped off."

Prices are affordable and food is decent. We recommend the sweet tempeh (45k idr) and onion rings (30k idr). Indonesian curry was a little light compared to Thai curry that we’re used to, but it’s probably the style here. What we love about the place though, is the lack of flies. It’s so so hard to find a restaurant here with no flies around.

If you’re looking to eat in place, then look no further, this is THE PLACE.","Very cosy place with delicious food. We had cassava, grilled fish, capcay, fried banana and those green crepes with coconut filling. Everything was really tasty. The restaurant was actually full, people needed to wait outside for a table.","Just WOW! It is a must have restaurant to try out. We eat local Indonesian food here two times and we still have dreams about it. Clean and nice location. English speaking staff and menu. Good portions and fresh coconuts!
Try it if you in the island!","During our recent holiday in Bali, we stumbled upon an absolute culinary gem – Payoda Warung. If you're a food enthusiast, this place is an absolute must-visit when in Bali. It's not just a restaurant; it's an experience that captures the essence of local flavors and hospitality.

The spring rolls at Payoda Warung are, without a doubt, the best we've ever had. The crispiness of the outer layer paired with the burst of flavors from the filling was a delightful start to our meal.

The grilled shrimps were nothing short of perfection. Cooked to succulent tenderness and seasoned just right, they were a true highlight of our dining experience.

The Nasi Goreng here is a must-try. It's a harmonious blend of flavors and textures that tantalize your taste buds. It was so good that we couldn't resist going back the next day for more!

But what truly sets Payoda Warung apart is the warmth and sincerity of the family running the place. You can feel their passion for creating exceptional local dishes and sharing their culture with visitors.

The cozy and authentic atmosphere adds to the overall charm. It's a welcoming haven where you can savor the true essence of Balinese cuisine. The staff is incredibly friendly and eager to make your dining experience memorable.

If you're in Bali and want to savor the finest local dishes in a welcoming environment, Payoda Warung is the place to be. It's not just a restaurant; it's an immersion into Balinese culinary artistry and hospitality. I can't recommend it enough, and I'm already looking forward to our next visit !!

Best from Switzerland !","Great little spot for an intimate dinner. Fabulous atmosphere and lovely food. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options. They are a little understaffed, so expect to take your time. The staff are warm and welcoming and prices are local."

Highly recommend for anyone visiting Nusa Penida!,"What a Beautiful experience 💗We stayed here for one day and totally worth the price.The room had breathtaking greenery view and plenty of privacy.Excellent service and Hospitality.Breakfast menu is limited but taste is fresh and good.Had a wonderful stay amidst Nature. Great location, near to almost all good restaurants and beaches.",Had a beautiful stay here with my boyfriend. It was very romantic. The place is beautifully done and spotless! Service was super amazing. The pool is so beautiful. Over all we had an amazing time. Thank you so much!,"One of the most beautiful place in Nusa Penida. We stay 2 night with my sister. The staff was super kind and helpfull all the time. The welcome dring and breakfast was so tasty. We stay in 7 tent was perfect. I think 7 and 8 tent have the best view. For the night its good if you have earplugs...in nature there are sounds, roosters, birds, crickets. But with earpugs was super.
There is no lunch or dinner but only 2 minute walk you will found some amazing restaurants.
We like all moments in this place and really wish to come back again! 🙏🏼
Thank you for Autentik to make our holiday perfect! 💕","I loved staying here, it's definitely authentic and a gem in Nusa Penida. The rooms are so comfy, stylish and nice - book the valley room if possible, it's worth it! I was also surprised about the absence of animals overall and the bathrooms are very clean & nice. The service is on point - the staff is kindly and always greet you with a smile. Helped me book boat and transfer prior to arrival. I got injured during my stay but they got me covered, appreciated this so much. The breakfast is very nice, pool area quiet and peaceful. The location is a bit secluded so it's more for a shorter stay where you go exploring during the days. For dinner / drinks - use the free shuttle to Amok sunset which is a very nice place with good view and delicious food. I also hired a private driver to see the east coasts highlights and it was so worth it. I absolutely recommend this place, thank you for a very pleasant stay!"

The staff was very kind, the bungalow was nice and pool area too. We loved the restaurant with jungle view, the staff there was so sweet 😊
We rented a scooter directly with them very easily + we had a great massage open-air 💆‍♀️
I'd suggest it for couples or small groups of friends. The bungalows are very close to each others so if the neighbours are loud, you won't sleep easily.

Be aware that there's literally no market close by, if you need to buy something (like l did) you need a car or a scooter otherwise it's a pretty long walk in a road that I'd not made for peatons 😬

With such name, l expected some yoga classes for the guests, was a bit disappointed that there wasn't any.. not even a yoga mat to use. But ok, not a big deal.","Nice, quiet place and cute small bungalows. Wouldn’t recommend to family bigger than 5 people. Restaurant has good view with a view of the forest and monkeys can be seen nearby. Staff told us all about the island and you can book mopeds, snorkelling and more through them!","I stayed 1 night in a very cosy bungalow : big room, huge bed, AC, coffee and tea + kettle in the room, spacious bathroom, desk for working and strong and fast wifi. The garden is very beautiful and the swimming pool is nice : that's the perfect place to stay if you want to work / study AND relax. The restaurant has a good variety of tasty food and I strongly advice you to try the desserts : the homemade Snickers was amazing.
The staff was also lovely and very helpful when it came to organize some activities around.
I definitely want to come back the next time I'll go back to Nusa Penida.","Namaste is a quiet and charming place with nice bedrooms.
They serve quality foods (special mention to the homemade tapenade) ans they helped us renting a bike for two days."

Further, there's no manager at night on site, no services or help was available.

It's about 25 min from the harbor. The website said they have a shuttle, but there is no shuttle.

Update: you can also smell the washroom in the smaller rooms.","Good enough for the half million rupiya we paid for staying.

Negative: The houses are very noisy. The staff keeps roosters in little cages and put them right next to the guest houses. The roosters wake you up between 4 and 6 AM! After complaining, the staff declared that the last time they checked the cages were empty. In other words; these roosters would have ended up there in a miraculous way?!

Also the staff has dogs who were barking throughout the night. The staff should keep those dogs and roosters at their homes!

The food at the Māoa Nusa Penida hotel up the road (where we stayed the first three nights) was several times more expensive and so much worse!

The property has 2 wheelers on rent service too . So it makes it easier for you to hire . The food was ok. The only issue i faced was it didn't have a refrigerator. The pool was great. Overall if you are going for a day or two you can consider it . As it's near to harbour also .,"Note: Giving 3 stars as the stay totally ruined my floating breakfast experience.

This property boasted a distinctive layout, featuring six villas with a swimming pool nestled in between. The location itself resembled a serene forest, creating a tranquil atmosphere. The cleanliness of the room, bathroom, and pool was impeccable, ensuring a pleasant stay. Moreover, the inclusion of a television with OTT subscriptions added to the entertainment options available. However, it is worth noting that the restaurant had limited vegetarian choices. We opted for pizza and juices, and while the selection was satisfactory, the watermelon juice stood out with its unique flavor, making it a must-try. On a slightly disappointing note, the floating breakfast experience fell short as the basket provided was almost empty. A floating breakfast is truly enjoyable when it features a generous assortment of items.",Clean and cozy place with clean pool and home atmosphere. Staff is very helpful.

The location is great but be aware that this is one of the quieter areas in Penida. It’s great if you are looking for some peace but if you want to party you’ll probably be better served elsewhere. For us it was perfect.

We personally liked being a little out of town, and it was very easy to organize scooters and port transfers through Mamaras! Thanks for a wonderful stay.","We chose a room in the main building because we stayed only one night in Nusa Penida and the price was affordable, but slightly higher than other accommodation in the area. However, although the room was relatively clean, the facilities were very low - there was no refrigerator in the room, the sink was outside the bathroom and very small, the water pressure was very weak. Also, there was no actual shower, which is why when you showered it got wet throughout the whole bathroom. Last but not least, the accommodation did not offer a towel for the floor or for the face, but only two large towels.
In terms of breakfast, compared to all the other accommodations where we had breakfast, this one offered the poorest and least tasty breakfast.
However, the location is good, close to the harbor and Crystal Bay. You can also reach Kelingking beach in about 30-40 minutes by scooter.
Although we did not have enough time to take advantage of the pool, we noticed that the garden and the pool are well cared for and the specific nature of the area makes the location a very beautiful one."

The scenery was beautiful and it was a relieve to walk in such a quiet and peaceful environment. The view of the sunset from that point was mesmerizing.

Simple basic breakfast was included too. The only negative thing about this villa is the very bad condition road leading to the villa, very bumpy and rocky road. Hard to find food as well, suggest to buy food and drinks before check-in. But they also provide takeaway food from nearby cafe stalls - NaNa Penida & Amok Sunset.","Amazing chalets with exotic room decorations, awesome views full of nature overseeing the sea and swimming pool, and 5 star customer service by the staff. Ideal for honey moon - quiet and relaxing. However the road to this chalet is quite challenging and bumpy, beware",Amazing hotel. Very little rooms so it’s very private and luxurious. The set up of the entire hotel is just dreamy and makes you feel like in paradise. I would firmly recommend this stay at nusa penida even if you are not planning to go there

The owner had sorted a scooter for us as well as pickup from the port, and was so helpful with directions around the island. If you have the chance to stay here, do so.

Room was spacious, bed and linens very comfortable, and had the coolest private outdoor shower. Staff was very friendly, helpful and accomodating. They were able to coordinate tours and transportation. No restaurant onsite but multiple restaurants close by. Also, walking distance to Gamat Bay.

The rooms are hut shaped and clean and spacious. The kitchen staff have language issues else very supportive.

Nyoman was always available over WhatsApp for any queries.
The resort is maintained well and small eateries nearby. In Night its really dark as it is an Island.

He arranged vegetarian food on request and it was good. He also arranged scooty for us and drop cab to port.

Highly recommend.",5 days stay. Very good place to visit Nusa Penida. Use the motobike or taxis. Nyoman and the staff are very welcoming and very available. We recommand,"It was the best stay that we could have ! Some past reviews are quite harsh to be honest. Everyone there is really really nice and we could always go to everyone to ask for recommendations and tips. They do the best they can to make the stay as comfortable as it can get!
We got picked up at the habour - our room is really spacious and super clean ! It was also easy to rent a scooter there - sure the roads to the hotel are not the best but not all streets on this island are in best shape. Breakfast is simple but good ! Thank you for everything 🫶🏼","Very nice resort, beautiful garden, very quite place, perfect location and really nice kindly staff!","Stayed here for 4 nights with my family in 2 bedroom villa.
It has 2 king sized beds both with separate bathrooms and aircon units. They put a mattress in lounge area for my son to sleep on.
Lounge has a kettle and fridge and a bench area if you want to put your laptop.
Really IM’s are spacious and beautiful in teak with high thatched ceiling.
The place is unbelievably quiet and peaceful away from the chaos of the town / roads and tourist attractions. The pool is stunning and surrounded by vegetation. There are few insects - I saw 1 mosquitoes during stay.
Breakfast is great juice, coffee, tea, fruit and choice of Indonesian or eggs or pancakes.
Bar is very limited- they only sell small Bintang and soft drinks / juices.
Meal choice is limited but really good. All fresh and decent sized portions - better than restaurant around the corner - so we ate here and bought our own wine. They do not charge the joke /15% surcharge and are very honest!
They rent scooters for 100k pd. pickup drop off from port is 150k by Yan in car.
Drive to port is about 15mins but traffic when we arrived was gridlocked and it took us 1 hour!
You can walk to Gamat bay in 30 mins which is great for a day out with a restaurant on beach and toilet etc. snorkelling is nice - and saw turtles.
They can arrange snorkelling trip 200k and driving trip to Kellingking / Angel Billabong etc for 700k including entrance charges.
Great natural wonders but tourism hell at its worst!
Crystal bay is 10 mins on a scooter. Pretty busy loads of restaurants and bars etc snorkelling off beach.
Overall this is a great place to stay with lovely peaceful ambience. There are small things they can do to make it better. However they did not bother me. People are warm attentive and genuine . It is a bit remote and roads are diabolical on Penida. But that makes it so wonderful!"

The rooms are beyond beautiful (we stayed in a normal room for one night and in the bungalow for the second) everything is so beautiful.

It was peaceful. Which is exactly what we wanted. To cut off for a few days. It’s close to quite a lot of restaurants by scooter but that’s to be expected on Nusa penida.

Everything was perfect, clean. Helpful and friendly staff. Definitely a place to be! Id recommend this place to anyone","I have visited Nusapenida couple times and stayed in different places, but Tala is the best of all. Bungalows are always my favorite, especially like Tala’s, they're beautifully designed. The bathroom is spacious and semi outdoor, the garden is huge and pretty during the day and night, the shala is also my favorite and every morning I always meditated there. Sita the owner is so thoughtful and likes to bake and cook, she often made some vegan cake & food for us as we are vegan. I appreciate her hospitality! I will stay at Tala again the next time I visit Nusa Penida for sure! ❤️","Luxury in the jungle! Our stay at Tala was perfect. From the beautifully appointed rooms and open air bathroom to the lush gardens and gourmet breakfast, no detail was overlooked.
The bed was so comfortable and the covered porches overlooking the garden were perfect for lounging while we listened to the rain. We came at the beginning of the rainy season, which wasn’t much and didn’t stop us from doing anything.
Iluh and the rest of the staff took great care of us. They helped with reservations, activities and securing rides which was much appreciated after a few long days of travel. And breakfast was amazing - don’t miss the banana pancakes with honey.
Highly recommend ⭐️","We loved our stay at Tala!

The bungalows feel luxurious yet have this incredible island jungle feel. The bathrooms were even better than we expected, and the open air shower was a delight!

The breakfast was continually amazing and you could tell a lot of thought & care went into the preparation. Our favourite was the warm oatmeal & nasi kunning (indonesian yellow rice).

The garden is just beautiful. We woke up early to do Yoga in the little Shala every morning with butterflies and honey bees visiting the garden around us.

Our favourite local restaurant, Warung Oregano, was only an 8 min walk/2 min scooter ride away. Make sure to try the lodeh (it is a local curry meal!)

Big plus: The rental scooters are very well taken care of and the helmets are good quality.","Wow, this place is just beautiful. We spent 4 wonderful nights at Tala. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was delicious. We can recommend basically anything from the breakfast menu (we tried lots of things)! The french press coffee is also one of the best we had in Bali. Sita locally sources the coffee beans. Iluh and Putu took lovely attention to us, whenever something was needed. All the little details, from the garden to the decorations, are intricate and beautiful.

We were a little weary of the geckos as described in the AirBNB. But we actually learned they keep out other jungle bugs!

Sita also organized our diving trips with their partner dive shop and it was amazing! We got to see the mantas!

We are very much looking forward to coming back to Penida and staying at Tala again!"

Little did I know, those two days would effortlessly transform into an extended stay of over two weeks, owing to the sheer magic of this place.

The allure of Lapaya Penida Bungalows is undeniable, not solely due to its spacious and uniquely characteristic bungalows nestled within a serene valley near Crystal Bay, but also because of the heartfelt experiences it offers.

One of the standout highlights of my stay was Lighat Cafe, a culinary haven within the premises. Here, I discovered the joy of indulging in delicious breakfast and dinners prepared with love, care, and the freshest ingredients by a delightful Indonesian woman. The meals were not just nourishment for the body but an embodiment of passion and authenticity, leaving an indelible mark on my entire experience.

Her partner, an experienced diving instructor, introduced me to the art and beauty of freediving. His passion for the ocean and expertise not only made the explorations safe but also added an educational dimension.

The charming bungalows themselves were an oasis of comfort, each detail carefully curated to ensure a harmonious blend of tradition and modern convenience. The spaciousness of the rooms, the thoughtfully stocked mini bar, the invitingly comfortable bed, and the impeccably clean, generously sized bathrooms made every moment of my stay a delight.

Yet, beyond the physical comforts, it was the heartfelt hospitality of the staff that made Lapaya Penida Bungalows feel like a true home away from home. Their genuine warmth and dedication to ensuring a memorable stay were beyond compare, adding an extra layer of joy to my days.

In retrospect, my unplanned extended stay at Lapaya Penida Bungalows was a testament to its irresistible charm and the captivating experiences it offers. It's not just a place to rest; it's a haven where every moment is infused with a blend of comfort, authenticity, and heartfelt hospitality, making it an absolute treasure on this picturesque island.","Nice little cottage with helpful and kind owners. Close to Gamat Bay (awesome for snorkeling) and Crystal Bay (and the 'hidden' beaches connected to it. Some restaurants in the area. Rooms were clean and there was a mini bar.
Breakfast was basic and not the best but enough to get your day started.","I recently stayed at Penida Lapaya Garden and overall, it was a decent experience. The owner was quite nice and accommodating, but the place was missing some important amenities such as a fridge and a place to hang clothes or towels, which was quite inconvenient. The location was a bit out of the way, except for those going to Crystal Bay, which was quite close.

The breakfast was okay, but I would not recommend it. It would be better to bring your own food or eat out somewhere else. The bathroom was not the most convenient as the closet was located next to the shower, so it would always get wet whenever we showered. However, the air conditioning was decent, though the roof wasn't closed enough, so the air escaped quite easily.

We stayed in room number 4, which was not the wooden house, and we actually preferred it that way. Nusa Penida can get quite hot, so having air conditioning was definitely a plus.

Overall, while it was a nice place, it was missing a lot of important things and could use some improvements to make it more comfortable for guests.",Good cafe and near with Crystal bay .Have motobaik for rent clean room with view to the garden.The personal very kindly.5stars.And price now 200 .000 rupiah.
