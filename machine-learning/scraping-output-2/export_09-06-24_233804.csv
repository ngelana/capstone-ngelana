It‚Äôs a wonderful place to enjoy nature. The cabin is located up in the mountain in Batukaru, Jatiluwih. The cabin surrounded by forest, rice fields, temples, and waterfalls. The interior and furniture are luxurious for camping enthusiast. The kitchen equipment is impeccable. The best thing is you can meditate anywhere and anytime in Bara Mountain Cabin. The staff is helpful make our stay more enjoyable. Def come back here one day. ü´∂üèº","Good place for a quick getaway.. good, clean facility, from the cabin we can see four mountain top‚Ä¶ and near enough to jatiluwih terrace","This is not a review.

This is a thank you message for creating beautiful space and still incorporating nature within

We really enjoyed every second of it. The staffs are lovely‚Ä¶",Perfection. This is the best place to stay in Jatiluwih. I haven't seen a cabin room this good and well designed anywhere in Indonesia. The view directly to the mountain while surrounded by forest trees is unbeatable. Literally take you off civilization that's due to the developments of the tourist area is hard to find.,I was happy to be there. It was so natural and comfortable. I dream of coming back there.

The owner is super friendly and being attentive to guests. The foods served in the restaurant were just simply delicious.

Accommodation was great, got a free upgrade. The only issue was that the hot water was not consistent.

It can be a bit tricky to find the location as Google Maps leads to a different place. Make sure you contact the owner before visiting to get an exact location guide.

Recommended!","Beware of scam, didnt refund my money. It was closed then we come. Worstüò°Awfully
They just block me at whatsapp ü¶•","Great place to stay for a few days. It is in the jungle,so  don‚Äôt expect a 5 star A/C hotelroom. Everything is in jungle style, with fire places, panorama deck, great view from your ‚Äútent‚Äù and so on. Only part of accomodation was tent; bathroom was brick-wall. Great food, very friendly staff, great jungle experience starts at camp site. Not too hot, but high humidity (it is in the jungle‚Ä¶). No A/C, but was not needed either","Nothing what I was expected.
Reality is other. The smell in the bed. When I start to doubt that they have changed the sheets and bedspread.  On me it is not a sheet, it is a sheet sewn to a warm quilt, and I wonder if this is washed every time the client changes?!?, it should be yes.  The food very good and tasty.  The place like that is Ava quiet, just the sound of nature.  It bothered me that he made me pay the total amount of my reservation and even dinner before going, there was good communication by wasap, but why the rush to collect?  Totsl the site was empty.","A serene and tranquil escape with breath-taking sunrise view. I stayed in their suite, which has wide front deck with spectacular view of the jungle and silhouettes of mountains. It can get quite chilly at night, not too cold and after a while you get used to it. The service is impeccable, they even picked me up at a close meeting point to make sure I don't get lost.

My only problem is with their water heater. I was looking forward to soak in the bathtub while enjoying the view, but the water heater wasn't working properly. When I asked them about it they only said that's the way it works ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

I highly recommend this place.,Just above Jatiluwih rice terrace. 5min by car. Lovely property. Quiet peaceful and family friendly. Host are incredibly helpful and sweet. Loved it! Would come back for sure!,"Nice cottage's in the middle of a lot of green. Only 15min by feet from the entry to the rice fields. There is a very nice cascade 15min down after the garden.
Also possibility the follow yoga lessons and mental healing sessions.","I barely slept. A steady stream of ants marched across the bed. The bed had insect carcasses strewn across it, mosquito netting notwithstanding. A giant spider the size of a small mouse lurked in the cottage. The pillowcase was stained. I would rather have pitched a tent and slept in the sleeping bag than in their bed. I slept with my clothes on.

The staff were accommodating and friendly. 450.000 for a 2-bedroom cottage for one night in June. The friend with whom I was traveling felt that this was poor value for the money we paid when compared to other options.","Great place for healing and melukat (aka. cleansing). You have to consult with the ""Mangku"" first before following the tradisional balinese ritual. Surrounded by coffee plantation, rice fields and 5 kinds of natural water source."
