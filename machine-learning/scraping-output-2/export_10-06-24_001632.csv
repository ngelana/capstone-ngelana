One of the most unique resorts we‚Äôve ever been to. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Food was excellent. The attention to detail was amazing. The sign by the pool says it all: they could‚Äôve put up a simple plastic sign to explain the pool rules but instead, they took the time to create something unusual and interesting. One note: if you have mobility issues, you should discuss with the hotel as there was a fair amount of walking up and down stairs. Our room was one of the most distant, but some rooms were much closer to the main part of the hotel.","One of the most unique and beautiful resort we have stayed. Absolutely fabulous. The attention to details are just amazing (like most of the Capella we have stayed). We have visited Bali many times, so only wanted to find some nice resorts and spend our time there. Capella suits our needs. The tranquil feeling when soaking in your pool and looking out at the forest... you will forget about all your worries. It also has one of the most grand hand hammered copper bathtub I have seen lol. Food and spa was excellent too. If price is not an issue, this is THE place.","We've been fortunate enough to stay in some 'Ultra' resorts and wow this is one of them. It's the most unusual, unique and luxury resort. So well planned with exquisite architecture.
The staff (everyone) were spectacular and magnificently attentive, nothing was too much trouble at all.
Food was off the scale and some of the best we'd had around the world!
What a fantastic hotel chain Capella is and worthy of their accolades.","‚ö†Ô∏èThis hotel is very expensive and the price is not commensurate with the experience we got. The distance from the airport is almost 2 hour drive.
Leeches, mosquitoes, caterpillars, are very annoying and disgusting. The service didn't look good from the first we arrived, the hotel staff didn't excuse when open the car door and not even knocked on the car door to open the door. My arm was still leaning, so I was shocked because I was about to fall. Even the hotel manager looked very unfriendly, the way he looked at us seemed to think that we were poor people who couldn't afford to pay. Is it because we don't tip them??? If I were poor and you wanted to invite me to stay at this hotel for free, I would immediately refuse without thinking twice. And for the staff who welcomed us in the lobby, I don't know what their names were, I really hated it when one of them stared at my wife's body shape, even looking deliberately at the slightly exposed part of my wife's breasts.","We had a lovely stay at Capella! The design is truly unique and the staff is very nice.
Two things to improve:
1. It would be nice if the driveway staff also spoke a little English. It was very hard to communicate when they refused to let our grab taxi in, there was just no way to get the message across. 2. The quality of the dental kit and the comb was shockingly low (See picture)."

That aside, the staff was amazing, they were kind and helpful and I felt very taken care of. The breakfast offered is simple but good, just fruit, toast, and eggs. There is a driver on site that is super great for giving recommendations and way more reliable than gojek. Obviously it's a little more than gojek, but if you negotiate beforehand it is, in my opinion, a good deal. It's very quiet and the rooms were clean and the bed comfy. It's not a fancy resort, it's very ""tucked away in the jungle vibes"", and because it's on a hill you have to take many steps to get to the top, but the location is good to go to south Ubud or to the Rice Terrace, lots of waterfalls, and the monkey forest. Overall a great stay.","I stayed there last year, summer of 2022, and I think the best advantage of this hotel is the amazing staff and good price. Otherwise, it wasn't a very good option for a single woman (was a bit scary inside, especially by night with all the noises of insects around, but yeah this is Bali in general :)","Beautiful place and nice staff, the free walk around the terraces and the village was great. Clean rooms, well-kept chlorine-free pool. Organic food from own garden was good but overpriced. Some breakfast options were good, but the fruit salad for example was tiny. All options include huge croissants + lots of coffee/tea in a pot. Free shuttle to Ubud three times a day, free water refills.","A beautiful outlook and excellent staff. We stayed here for three nights with our friends, accompanied by our two kids and their three. (2 -10 year range). The little villas are airy and very 'Bali'.  The food was very nice and reasonably priced with a menu that catered for our range of fussy eaters.  I highly recommend the village tour which took us through the beautiful rice paddy terraces and finished with a visit to the local art school.  Such intricate and detailed art work from a talented artisan. The road is nearby with lots of steps,  but it was a great contrast to the chaos of Kuta and Ubud. We often had the pool virtually to ourselves.  A lovely place to stay.","Stayed at the Alam Sari for three days with by my partner, It was a very enjoyable experience. All the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The room itself was clean and well kept. There is no television, but there is a safety deposit box and a very cool bathroom.
If you get the chance, speak to a man there named Putu. He offers a free tour of the surrounding area through the jungle and rice patties and tells you about all the different plants they harvest. Very interesting if your into that kind of thing :)"

The food was carefully and artistically crafted by the chef standing before our community bar /table - such an intimate dinner beyond any restaurant we've enjoyed in Bali! We received a beautiful education about the food for each of the ten courses, and why the chef chose the ingredients. I will post some pictures that capture the artistry! I highly recommend this experience.
In addition, I brought several allergies to the dinner, and the chef was notified 24 hours in advance and carefully prepared my meal thoughtfully, and it did not suffer in taste or presentation.","Beautiful surrounding and good food.
My friend and I tried Chef Russo‚Äôs cooking when he did a guest shift in Singapore last year and we decided to drop by Bali to try his dishes.

Among our favourites were the prawn, steamed egg .(The menu at Api Jiwa could have been updated as we were there last month.)
The wine or cocktail pairing completed the entire meal for us.
Much effort was put into the creation and cooking.
We planned part of this trip to coincide with eating at Api Jiwa.
It was well worth our trip to Bali!
The only downside wqs  the booking.
There was no online booking system. I called 3 times long distance before it was finally done:
Emailing did not work as no one  replied .
This was 16 seater so getting slots confirmed is of utmost importance. Much so if guests are  flying in just for this.","We had an amazing experience at this restaurant with our whole family. The food was excellent, and the service was exceptionally attentive. The ambiance and overall atmosphere made us feel incredibly comfortable and left a lasting impression. We‚Äôre grateful to the team for providing us with a fantastic taste of Bali cuisine and hospitality. Thank you!","Great food. Great chef.
Service is S L O W and the wine menu is not up to par. Overall a good experience which could be heightened","The experience and the food is amazing. A 10-course meal, each of which is explained by the chef and his staff. The service was phenomenal the entire time. You will need to make reservations well ahead of time as the spots at the chef's table fill up quickly. For good reason. You will not regret going to dinner and experiencing this"

Excellent service, lovely family. Rooms are clean and and their lovely dogs will pay you a visit, sooo cute ü•∞üê∂üêï","I had a really great time at Telaga Homestay in Keliki village. It's even more beautiful than the pictures.  Tangan, Telaga, Ayun and the rest of the family are really friendly and helpful and it's nice to observe some of the routines of a Balinese family such as creating the offerings. I highly recommend Telega's body massages. I also recommend the painting class I did. Also, there is a nice walk in the rice fields and forest at 5min from the place. The morning concert of roosters is indeed very loud, but I took advantage of waking up early anyway and went to do daily yoga at 7.30am at Om Ham Retreat (10min drive away), where you can also have buffet breakfast for 75k and sound healing at 19.00. I am grateful for the opportunity to stay there with Home Exchange, because otherwise I wouldn't have discovered the North villages of Ubud, an area more authentic, quiet and with more nature than the Ubud center's busy streets and crazy traffic.","Such a beautiful place and so much of care. Good food, good rooms and warm welcoming family. These are the best human beings you can ever come across. A must visit","Awesome Guest house!!
It is a great place to stay in an area, which is not too touristy. Nearby there are still great places to go to and discover. There are many beautiful rice fields around and also stores and warungs to get everything you need.
The room and bathroom is very clean and is decorated nicely- there is a fan and very good wifi-connection. Also the outside area is neat.
The hosting family is just the kindest and very lovely! Always offering to help and having great recommendations of what to do in the area. Telaga is offering great massages for a really good price! Can only recommend! Thank you for everything! Terima kasih banyak! Would love to come back!"

The food was amazing and when I say amazing I mean the best I have had so far in Bali. I ordered Seafood Mie Goreng for mains and the flavours blew my mind. Flavours were really close to home. Everything was as close to Balinese flavours as I wanted. Hats off to the owner for preserving Balinese culture in a beautiful way.
Talking about service, Eris was really polite and showed us a few nice parts of the Capella after the meal.
Atmosphere was lovely overall. Wish I had time to make a reservation for lunch as well the next day and see the view in the day time.
P.S. Reservation is required but really smooth process.",Treated myself to an early bday dinner at  Capella‚Äôs restaurant during my solo trip in Bali last May 23. I have to say all was spectacular and overwhelming. From the. Kindness of the staff to the food and service. The full experience will remain fixed in my memory forever. I mixed and matched fish dishes that night and it was memorable. All so tasty and fresh. Shoutout to this place and the Italian Chef!! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Also had some time after dinner at their campfire watching black & white movies and drinking ginger tea under a wonderful sky full of stars. This place is something different and every traveller who touches Bali should go and check it out!!,"Perfect spot to relax around Tegalalang Ubud! Great dining ambience, very green view because this al fresco restaurant is surrounded by lucious green garden and coconut trees.

Menu choices are great and warm hospitable service. Their sourdough served with butter, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar, iced tegallalang tea, and their cheesecake dessert is a must try.

Great spot for any occasion, from me-time, date nights to family lunch/dinner.

They are open for public but make sure you give them a call to reserve a table beforehand.

Thank you Chef Nico and the team for great experience today. Definitely will be back üíö","First thing first: this place is amazing as well as very expensive compared to normal Bali prices.

Let's focus on food: we had an extremely pleasant breakfast experience, I choose the Japanese bento style option and my fiancee took Avo on sourdough. Food was excellent, coffee and juices as well. It is an all you can eat breakfast style.

Service: simply excellent, Ayu and Swandi took excellent care of us, even called us by our names every time they came to our table. They also gace us a tour around the beautiful hotel and explained the history.

Choose this place to treat yoursel or a special occasion.","Absolutely spectacular place for dinner! Expensive if you compare it to Bali prices, but you get a highest class service, food and view. If you want to celebrate something, you need to do it here! We ate the best beef rendang and for desert we had salted caramel magnum. It was just perfect. If you visit this place, go here around 6pm and they invite you to the evening ceremony. Later you can chill out at the bonfire and grill some home made marshmallows. Lastri took a really good care of us :)"
