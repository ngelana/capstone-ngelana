We were constantly waking up with  employees on the property. The rooms should also be cleaned of spiders. We where not allowed to talk loudly, the music is only muted, a kind of sanatorium in a beautiful location.","The construction and fabrication of the bamboo homes are amazing with such attention to detail. It was a pleasant suprise to have air conditioning in bedrooms. The sound of the river below very relaxing.

All the stairs could be problem for some with mobility issues. The noise from children in nearby homes was a little unexpected especially if you were on a romantic vacation. There was trash left around the pool area from a birthday party the following morning, ironically from children from a nearby ‚Äúgreen school‚Äù.

Food menu was limited. Ice for drinks was limited. Only one clean bath towel was provided for 3 nights.  It would be nice to be able to warm up the temperature of the pool to a desired temperature. The staff was extremely helpful and kind. The massages were fabulous and very reasonably priced.","A magical experience. It feels like a movie set.

The views over the valley are amazing and you feel a part of the wonderful natural area all around you.

The staff were all amazing, helpful, and kind.
The foot was fantastic, some of the best food we‚Äôd eaten all trip. Would go back just to eat there again!

Stayed for two nights, we will return!","Wow! Simply wow. This property is stunning and will definitely make your Instagram light up.

We stayed in the Temple Villa. It's huge. The bedrooms were comfortable with great beds, linens, and pillows. The A/C in the rooms worked well to keep us cool at night.  The private pool was perfect for a cooling dip.

The on site cafe provided great meals and the staff on property was fantastic.

We stayed for 3 nights and loved being this close to nature.

You are in the jungle, so ants, caterpillars, flying bugs, and lizards are common visitors. Green Village provided us complimentary mosquito repellent to help. We had no issues of concern.","I had a tour in Green Village, and it was incredibly informative. They explained why and how bamboo is used in house construction, along with the whole philosophy surrounding this movement. The area is amazing‚Äîyou can actually stay in one of the bamboo houses."

The house is a work of art and we loved all the details. The breakfast was really yum and we loved have the fresh water machine. The staff were so lovely too. We would highly recommend. The team even made a flower bath for us. I can't wait to go back and bring my whole family. 10*,"Excellent!! We loved this sustainable bamboo house with unusual architecture in the middle of the Balinese jungle. We spent 3 days in Aura House and greatly enjoyed our floating breakfasts, the yoga sessions and massage at the privacy of the house. We also attended the tours to Green School and Green Farm and loved the energy of the whole place.

We highly recommend this place and we will definitely be returning in the future. Thank you so much Aura House for making our stay so unique and special.","Our time spent at Aura House was absolutely amazing! The details that have gone into the architecture of this spectacular villa are incredible in every way. We felt like royalty within the bamboo walls, and were so grateful to experience a space so breathtakingly unique & beautiful! The staff were also incredibly kind and took amazing care of us. We would love to stay here again someday soon. Thank you Aura House for making a once distance dream a reality for us.","We stayed there with another couple and we had the best stay. We arrived with the sound of the rain in the jungle. In the morning the sunrise was facing the main room, the egg one which is one of a kind for many reasons. We could get amazing pictures with the light coming in that way. Then after breakfast we could experience a must do over there. The red flowers bath in the pool. Definitely recommend aura house for any getaway with friends or family.",We had a great time at aura house Bali! The architecture is just amazing and the whole green village is just impressive. We loved all the details and the overall concept of creating something completely sustainable (everything from the furniture to the straw is made out of bamboo) It was the perfectly place to unwind and recharge in the jungle. We also used the massage service which was great as well. I can‚Äôt wait to come back and see the green village develop..!

As a bule myself with 20 years in Indonesia, I was so inspired and proud of the Hardy family, especially, Elora.  I've seen the houses on Instagram, but the series really impressed me with Elora's design ideas.  It made me respect and understand her struggle to design even the minor things.  Yet, the thing I struggle with is what will I leave behind....what is my legacy.  And Elora has created something that is hers.....that came from her heart and the passion and love for Bali and and the people.  These are architectural masterpieces made from incredibly talented Indonesian people - and Elora, you've always been Indonesian.",good place and nice service recomend for photo addicted,"Seems a little over priced for Indonesia, i sure hope they pay their staff decent wages. Beautiful bamboo art.","This villa over magnificent view, and the architecture also superb, the issues is on the street is so small",Been there for 1 amazing night. This villa is a peace of art
