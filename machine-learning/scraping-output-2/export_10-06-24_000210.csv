The team put a lot of time and effort into your surfing and helping you improve. Would recommend to anyone of any surfing level. I stayed for a week but could have stayed for a month. I will come back for certain.,"10/10 experience from start to finish! Muklis and his crew were so welcoming, great teachers and we felt so confident with them in the waves! We spent a week at the surf camp and were able to join them on a trip over to Java to a secret surf spot, which we absolutely loved! This was a truly authentic and wonderful experience, highly recommend!","If you're looking for a surf camp par excellence, you have come to the right place! Muklis and his team at Medewi Secret Surf Camp have it dialled. They‚Äôll take you to the best spots for your ability, where you can surf along peaceful beaches with nonchalant, grazing cows, and his crew are there for you both in and out of the water. As a guest, Muklis welcomes you into his family and makes you feel right at home. He takes care in what he does, is an attentive coach, and all his staff are friendly and helpful. It‚Äôs like a little community, a sharing in fun activities, dinners, and holiday parades. During surf coaching sessions, Muklis and his instructors are beside you every step of the way to ensure you‚Äôre having fun and catching lots of waves. Head Coach Muklis and Coach Soleeh share their expertise with a video analysis after every session, where you can learn ways to improve your surfing, whether that be tips on surf technique, timing, positioning and equipment knowledge. Need help with guiding, transport or restaurant recommendations? Look no further! You‚Äôll get a ride to the beach, motorbike rental, food delivery. I love supporting local mom and pop businesses and Muklis has a beautiful family. Grateful for this experience and looking forward to seeing these wonderful humans next time! Thanks Muklis & Family at Medewi Secret Surf Camp for all the great waves and good memories‚Ä¶ Let the good vibes roll! Yewww ü§ô

N.B. - To ensure an accurate review in comparison, I tested out another surf camp before I left Indonesia and MSSC shined with flying colours üòÜ 10/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚ú®üôå","I don't even know where to start. Its good vibes all around. Accomodation is fantastic, Muklis, his family and Team will make you feel at home. Most importantly, if you would like to pick up surfing seriously or take your surfing to the next level this is definitely the place for you. Trust me. I stayed for a month and came in as a kook. I am leaving with memories of catching waves I never thought I would. He is fantastic, his family is fantastic, his team is fantastic and their coaching is fantastic. Special shout out to Sole, Daffa and Arman for looking out for me. So psyched and one of the best experiences of my life! This is definitely not goodbye.","I stayed for a week only in Medewi !
The owner and his staff/family were awesome and extremely helpful to get your surf on the next level !
A must go
Thanks again"

The mosquito nets were broken, so we had to fight mosquitoes and flying ants all night long. We had to (sort of) wash the toilet by ourselves, since it was unusable.
