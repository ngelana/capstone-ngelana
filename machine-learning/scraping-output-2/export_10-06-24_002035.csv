The road was not easy to beginner to visit because its a little bit high and slippy when its rain. No ticket needed because it just located at roadside. Not really worth it to visit but if you just passing by, its good to take a little bit photos here","Salah lokasi woyyy, Google gimana ni!!!
The map its wrong, here its not a Bukit putung
Please Be careful","Perfectly view ü§Ø
You actually can see both other islands!!
(Nusa penida) + (lombok)
Very recommended.
There‚Äôs also two ladies that selling staff",Bali has virtually every kind of natural beautyüèû,"This I would rate the most beautiful back road that starts from blue lagoon beach and immediately climbs up to mount agung , the route has some hidden treasures of Bali ,like the volcanic stone cutters. And narrow twisty roads and at some point you get the view from the mountain to the ocean and the far away island ! And it is amazingly quite its a place o would never forget"
