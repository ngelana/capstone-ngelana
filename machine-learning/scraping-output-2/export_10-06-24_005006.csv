Look no further then to the town of Mas where the excellent Tony Raka gallery and cafe is located. An easy drive from Ubud just head south to the town that offers a good deal more attractions.

The blend of local and international cuisine ensures that everyone can get a good meal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶make sure you tour the displays in the back and even ask for a tour of the stunning houses in the back of the car park.,"I went there twice together with my daughters while working on my writing. Sat by the window facing the Balinese pelinggih (?) and the garden where people can sit there and spend their time with friends.

They also have the round table for family group having lunch or dinner or for a small meeting in their air con area.

I love their avocado coffee (the best), their juice and their Balinese yellow rice (it's delicious).",A cozy cafe mixed with cool art! Free entry to a big gallery with awesome stuff. And their brownies are so good! The impressive collection and cozy ambiance make it a must-visit. Great spot for art and treats!,"Very nice food - I had the Nasi Kunming.  Service quite & friendly.  At about 20% capacity at lunch time and almost everyone was scowling at their laptops.  Large comfortable place, easy parking.  The art in the restaurant is pretty aggressive."

The property is well-maintained, and every employee I encountered was friendly and helpful. The service was excellent, and the food quality exceeded my expectations. Overall, it was a good time, and I would highly recommend this hotel.","In the beginning, we chose this hotel for our family vacation 2023 based on internet reviews, and we had a pretty good impression during our early stay. However, unfortunately, on the last day of our stay, there was a human error from either housekeeping or room service. They opened our room door with their spare key while we were still asleep after celebrating the New Year's Eve 2023-2024.

I'm disappointed with the lack of privacy while we were still asleep, as the door was opened without consideration, claiming they wanted to clean the room. Is there no proper system for guest check-in or check-out times, so it's not recorded, and they can casually open guest room doors?

Regrettably, we won't recommend this hotel for future family holiday stays. üôèüèº","This a wonderful hamlet close to ubud....amazing service and beautiful place ....cheetah the host along with the other reception person was amazing and very helpful.....neat and clean rooms with a nice mini pool....lots of green and good but limited breakfast....a little change in variety of dishes would be very helpful...the restaurant they have is nice with very tasty food...
All in all a value for money place....special thanks to cheetah....",I believe this was one of the best stay in our entire vacay. The rooms are so good and great interior with that old touch. The great part is it was value for the money we paid. I would suggest this place if you are looking for budget friendly stay yet  great one then simply go for this. Only issue I had was with the extra  bed/bed sheets as we were always getting bumps and redness on our skin after using the bed. Otherwise great stay,The older type buildings are a treasure to be appreciated. My Al fresco bathroom a great attraction. The air-conditioned bedroom and bed are excellent. Having the fridge outside in the bbq area a minor inconvenience. Private direct access to the pool is an added bonus (Room 200) even if the steps up to the gate are a bit of a hazard.

The food, while not spectacular, managed to hold its own. The setting was quite lovely, with a pleasant backdrop adding to the ambiance.

However, a curious encounter with the waitress left us puzzled. She nearly dictated our meal choices, and given her insistence, we relented, wondering if we were simply being offered whatever was left in the kitchen. The presentation of the dishes was certainly appealing, but the prices leaned towards the higher end for Bali. The restaurant's claim of being organic might explain the premium, though.

Interestingly, there was a religious gathering happening about 100 yards from our garden seating, providing an unexpected glimpse into local culture. Amidst this cultural touch, we shared our dining space with geckos and flies, but I must admit the restaurant's provision of mosquito spray was a considerate gesture.

In hindsight, would I consider revisiting Kayun Restaurant? Probably not. While the experience wasn't inherently bad, it didn't leave a strong enough impression to warrant a return visit.",Amazing food in an amazing location. So innovative dishes with lots of vegetarian choices. They even make their own colored noodles for their noodle dishes like Mii Goreng and Noodle soup. Staff was extremely well trained and so friendly. The location is so beautiful and it makes you wanna stay even longer just to enjoy the nice view.,"Over priced and over rated. Would not visit again. Not sure how they were awarded an award for Trip Advisor, to me it seems outdated.

Portions are extremely small given the amount you are paying. Be careful when ordering as they may not make the food as per what is described on the menu. Other restaurants in the area to try where you‚Äôll have a better experience.","Kayun restaurant is by far one of the highlights of my Bali trip. The service and the food were espectacular and the place is magical. It is very relaxing and you truly feel the essence of Bali. We had crispy duck which was great.

This is really one of the hidden gems of Ubud.",Nice ambiance with fresh tropical air from rice paddy field in front of it. The menu is authentically Balinese with delicious taste and also other options available.

We did enjoy many trips around Ubud and the host with staff did support us with great ideas and could arrange drivers to any places. Angel House is not seen from the street and as soon you reach the house it's like a little paradise island midst the lively city Ubud (in the south). We highly recommend this place.

Bathroom entrance is too small and has no locking system inside. There is hardly any space around. A small pool not maintained properly. Kitchen attached has hardly any utensils for cooking if one desires.
As a senior citizen going for a vacation I do not recommend  staying there.","Just returned from a 4 night stay at Angel House with extended family who were experiencing Bali for the first time.

In general it was wonderful, with great service from the Villa staff and incredible value for money.

Pros
> Stunning garden and pool were a joy to return to after a hectic day.
> Vinna, Kadek & Ibu Wayan looked after us as if we were family. Nothing too much trouble. Arranged massages (poolside) and trips. Breakfast with a smile. Always contactable.
> Incredible value for money.
> Location has some decent coffee (Art Lounge, Segelas Kopi, Karambia) and local restaurants within walking distance. There is also a really nice walk recommended which will take you through rice fields and local villages.
> Small operation who are environmentally conscious and support the local community.

Cons
> Smaller than it looks on website. No different to 90% of all hotels.
> Common areas (dining area, lounge) are locked up after midday. Would have been nice to have them available all day so we could sit round the dining table as a family or enjoy the library area.
> Villa staff operate in the morning only, which was not a big deal for us but without night-time security and no lock for the main door might not be suitable for some.
> Tiled floor outside each Villa became dangerously slippery after rain. My elderly mum slipped & fell and could have been seriously hurt. Maybe look at extend the roof coverage or provide mats.","We have had the most beautiful stay at Angel house in Ubud, amazing hospitality, a beautiful room and feels like a home away from home. We can‚Äôt wait to be back again!","This is one of the best places I stayed in Bali. The hosts are amazing, very kind and the breakfast is delicious. It feels like being part of a family when you live there.
They will organize a driver for you, so its super easy to do the rice fields, hiking etc.
The place is not in the center of Ubud (2km). You can easily take the bus and it is very calm around the accommodation. You can take walks around the rice fields, they invite you to see ceremony's, if there is one. So if you want a real authentic balanese experience, you can get it there.

It is a perfect place to be in Ubud, close to a local community with very good restaurants nearby as well as supermarkets .to get to the centre it is very simple to use the motorbike taxis , cheap and fast so distance is not a problem and being away from the hustle and bustle is appreciated . It really is a beautiful place to spend some time residing there.","a recommended place to stay if you are on vacation in ubud with beautiful views of rice fields, fresh air away from pollution, a very comfortable place, and very friendly service from the owner and family. This villa also has a swimming pool, and the residence is made of wood which makes the atmosphere more classic.","Everything are good. Only cleaness and we had trouble with the door keys. We are javanese feel safe if we can lock the door. The rabbits run around the villa, the kids happy chasing the rabbit. The owner also  friendly. I hope after pandemic done and everything run well, this place can be better.","These 3 weeks here in the wooden house were lovely, much better that i expected. Gede and all the family is fantastic, always available to give us what we need and more. The house is beautiful, far from noise of the downtown but at only 10min by motorbike, looks to live inside a temple with an amazing view and a private pool. I higly recommended this place to everybody and if one day i will come back in Bali this will be my choise."

Thank you!","a good and strategic place to have a pasta and another kind of foods, they have so many options: italian, western, indonesian, chinese food. i ordered aglio e olio & carbonara spaghetti and it was pretty good",I come here when I go to Villa Kitty. I come here because it's easy to park my car and it has an open garden feel to it and because the pizza crust is thin and crunchy. Tbe waffle and ice cream are good too.,The pizza was great! The sauce on the spagetti carbonara needs to be thicker.,"Ordered on Grab app and couldn‚Äôt find a driver to deliver the food. Instead of calling me to ask if I could pick up they made me wait 1 hour even though it was around the corner. I had to call them and ask what was going on. After another 30 min got my food and the food was disappointing. 3 pastas. Very cold. Smallest portions. Tasted bland.
Apparently the pizza is good. Definitely try sit in to this place maybe that‚Äôs better."
