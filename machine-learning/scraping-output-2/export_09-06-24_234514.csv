Very recommended, one stop entertainment for whole family.
Super affordable price (entrance, food, adventures). They have flying fox, swing, pool, archery, restaurant in the river, Instagramable photo spots. Amazing view, friendly staffs. Just great!! ❤❤❤","My 2nd melukad experience! We were accompanied by a very bright, passionate volunteer who not only recites the prayers during the procession but also explain in details about the landmarks. This is a very modern melukad complex, a convenience to do such sacred rite.","Very hidden place, relax and quiet.  You can swim and relax for a day trip there. Has a small restaurant there too. Big parking space.  Can be good for meditation trip too.","Great place for chill up with family and friends, they has garden and playing kids as well, we can bring the food like camping","A beautiful garden, suitable for families and those with children, with swings, a hanging rope, walking with a bicycle on a rope, swimming pools suitable for children, nests for photography, a running river and a popular restaurant, which is in the Senganan area of ​​Tabanan
