If you want to really learn about the culture, costumes, nature and food of this beautiful island is the place to go.
Alit and his family are like a family away from home and will teach you everything they know, giving the time and attention to each detail. Unforgetable.","Absolutely amazing. Alit and Yoga are the best to show you the jungle, the fruits, the vegetables and they cook it delicious. A great experience","It was a really interesting and informative trekking with Alit and his partner. They showed us then local fruits, plants, and edible vegetables. He also showed us the traditional Balinese villages, temples and the agricultural rituals. We learned so much and had lots of fun.","A very unique and extremely interesting and rewarding experience to stay with a special family. The village location is dramatic  being the highest on the slopes of Batu Karu. Alit is famous for his sawah and jungle walks and Era is an amazing cook.
I take many guests here and they all say it is the highlight of their Bali holiday. I love staying here.","Alit you are the best!!! Tai & me really enjoy our experience with you in your home and in the jungle!

Everybody have to go in your place!!!

We will come back for sure!"
