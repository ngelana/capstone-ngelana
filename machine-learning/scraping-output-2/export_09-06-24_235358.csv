+ food price are affordable and taste are very good compare than similar cafes
+ view are very very nice you could see the rice paddies in the front of you while enjoying your food
+ there are some spot to take photos
+ food atmosphere for family or small gathering
+ wide space and with a good air circulation ( fresh air ) this place is an outdoor bay the way
Here is some minus points
- staff could be more attentive and smile
- sometimes tables still could found some debris as well as the floor
- main building bit close to road in case have vehicles with a noise sound it could bit annoying when we having meal

But despite those minus points but overall it‚Äôs worth to visit and the food price are very very affordable and their quality and quantity also nice","Their food are delicious! If u like those balinese‚Äô spices and seasonings, you gonna love this one!
