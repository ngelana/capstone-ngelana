A really beautiful tent and terrace overlooking lush plantations. The tent, terrace and bathroom are constructed to a very high quality, very clean, spacious and well sealed from the elements. The food all excellent and the coffee beans, coffee machine and grinder in the tent are a great bonus. Most of all, the hospitality from Mega and Yusuf is amazing. So friendly and full of information about the area.","Highly recommended: Outstanding stay and original Indonesia experience at Sanda Plantation Hideaway.

Who wrote this review: We are an active couple in our mid-thirties living in Germany. We love Indonesia and had come over 6+ times already as we love the people living here, their culture and last but not least the landscape. In the past years coming over for mostly 4-weeks of vacationing we experienced also downsides of tourism which you can think of if you compare Ubud 10 years ago with the state now. But this does not apply to this place. This is a place, a small piece of paradise in fact, which we began to love the first times we visited Indonesia and Bali over 10 years ago.

The review: Mega and Toine are the most lovely and caring hosts you are ever going to met. They will provide you with everything you need, at the same time they are not overprotective. Both are very open minded, so it is up to you to have a high level chat, a deep talk about different cultures in Indonesia or just stay completely private. You can get a lot of information from their well structured website, too.
The plantation is a highly natural place, you can feel the balanced energy and hear a concert of natural sounds (better than every Spotify nature sounds playlist) - they offer a basic tent, a wooden house and a tent with modern comfort, eg. a regular bed, private bathroom below the tent and wifi.
Additionally to the stay you will be offered organic breakfast and dinner. The food was cooked by themselves and most if not all ingredients were originating from their plantation. The variety of plates was exceptional, they will surprise you or adapt to your wishes - in any way it was more than enough amount of food and had an excellent taste. Coffee lovers are also going to be satisfied to the fullest with a high standard espresso machine, grinder and fresh local coffee beans inside the tent (+slow brew option, organic tea and more).
As stated initially, the landscape, people and culture reminded us so much of Indonesia and South/East-Bali 10 years ago, just with better street conditions - a small piece of heaven on earth basically. With that said you are going to experience very happy, helpful, respectful and communicative locals on the street as well in their temple. They appreciate if you try to speak their local language, regardless if you can do it properly or not. The point is locals understand this like paying respect to them. The rice fields and terraces are endless, like you can imagine the popular places Tegallalang and Jatiluwih a long time ago.
In terms of activities the hosts are also offering a variety of expeditions as Toine is a photographer and has quite a lot of experience with that, he is even a member of a tribe. Mega is Toines even more hearty counterpart and an outstanding cook, they complement each other perfectly. Plus: they have very lovely dogs and staff over there!
Long story short - our stay was exceptional and we can highly recommended this place for couples, singles, friends and families with kids.

Downsides: None for us, we will 100% come back, everything was outstanding and exceptional. If you are sensitive to insects and mosquito’s (like Europeans are per default, as ‚we‘ are not used to it) you should use anti-repellent in the morning and evening which the hosts even provide. In the worst case you can use anti-bug spray which is provided as well, but absolutely not needed during our stay. There were no issue with bugs or bites - quite the opposite, they stay away and you are free to observe them closer if you like to.

Our advice: Plan more than just a few days in this place. We had just two nights, whereas we had an exceptional time still. We recommend a stay of at least 1+ week.

Nadja & Sebastian",I had the most amazing time at this secluded gorgeous plantation. The views and scenery are so beautiful with rice paddies and palm trees and thick forest everywhere you look. I stayed in the main room which had an incredible view. The rooms facilities were very nice and clean and you can see the owner is very invested in his plantation. Everything is very comfortable and I have no complaints whatsoever about the sleeping conditions. It's the perfect place if you need a getaway surrounded by nature and waterfalls. The food cooked was also so delicious. I couldn't have asked for a better stay.,"Located in Sanda Village, Sanda Plantation Hideaway is the perfect weekend escape from the busy traffic in Denpasar. The views from the tents are terrific, overlooking rice fields and vast vegetation. The food was delicious, clean, and comforting. Learning about the various different plants and crops that are planted here was very intriguing. The showers and toilets are also very clean and showering with the open air and view is a very delightful experience, especially after a full day of activities, such as visiting nearby waterfalls.","Highly recommend this place! The best service we had in Bali (and not only here). Incredible views, convenient location. The tent was designed to trifle (every small detail was made with love). There is everything for a comfortable stay (even repellents and flashlights). Coffee deserves special attention (coffee connoisseurs will be pleased)...and breakfast, it was very tasty and generous. We also ordered dinner and were satisfied (to full belly, haha). It was very nice to talk with hosts, they were as hospitable as possible. We will definitely come back here for more than one night."
