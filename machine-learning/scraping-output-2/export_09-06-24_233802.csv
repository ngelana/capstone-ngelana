The location is stunning
The staff is amazing
The whole experience is one of the top experiences I have ever had

Discovering something special is a rare joy. The Aurora Cabins are just that â€“ a hidden gem I chanced upon on Google Maps, leading to two unforgettable days.

The View: Unparalleled. Staying in a cabin with a skylight was an experience, yet it was the balcony that truly captivated me. Hours passed as I watched clouds dance over the jungle, comfortably shielded from the rain, legs dangling in the air. My Kindle lay forgotten, such was the allure of nature's spectacle.

Nestled amidst a verdant coffee plantation on Mount Batakaru's slopes, these cabins blend seamlessly into the jungle. At night, the wild symphony of the jungle was a stark, yet pleasing contrast to the sterile silence of my last night at a Bali airport hotel.

The Cabins: A masterclass of thoughtful design and luxury. Whether it was the skylight cabin or its counterpart with a fireplace, each feature spoke of meticulous attention to detail. From the Nespresso machine to the full gas-powered BBQ, it was evident that 'no expense was spared' â€“ a phrase that often came to mind.

However, the Aurora Cabins aren't for everyone. Their secluded charm comes with considerations:

1. Jungle Proximity: Expect bugs and spiders. The staff are excellent at mitigating any discomfort, and a simple change in lighting use at night can greatly reduce the presence of harmless insects (turn on lights further away from you, instead of the ones overhead).

2. Self-Sufficiency: As of December 2023, the lack of room service means being your own chef. The emphasis is on grilling, a fun, albeit messy, adventure for first-timers. Tip: Stock up on food, especially easy-to-grill items like sausages and vegetables. Better too much than too little.

3. Local Environment: Being near organic rice fields and a chicken farm means flies are part of the experience. The staff are adept at handling them, but vigilance is key to keeping them out of your cabin. Donâ€™t dilly dally while opening the cabin door.

Despite these quirks, a stay here promises a once-in-a-lifetime experience with just a bit of preparation.

A special thanks to Dedy, whose service excellence transformed every potential frown into a smile, making me feel cared for beyond just a customer.

In conclusion, the Aurora Cabins are not just a place to stay; theyâ€™re an awe-inspiring experience. So, pack your bags (and donâ€™t forget the sausages) for an adventure you wonâ€™t forget. This journey reminded me of the beauty and unpredictability of nature, and how sometimes, the best discoveries are those we stumble upon.

PS, I hear room service is coming, but honestly, I canâ€™t wait to try grilling again in a future stay!","One of the most incredible places Iâ€™ve ever stayed. The cabins have amazing architecture, incredibly luxurious with an unbelievable view of the mountains and all of Bali on a clear morning. Hot tub and massage was perfect ending of my day.","The paradise place for introverts or romantic couples night. I took room with fireplace,  so refreshing to have cold mountain air in evening near the fire. And the sunrise with panoramic wall was like a  miracle ."

I was glad I was not driving myself, the road to this gem is small and lots of corners.
The restaurant is beautifully made of bamboo, the food was very good and the service excellent! I recommend!","The restaurant is located in the middle of a forest bamboo. The road to get here was smooth as it was a sunny day. If you drive a car, be extra careful because the road is only for 1 car. It has a separate  area for parking. As you walk into the bamboo forest, u will smell a very clean air and feel a positive atmoshphete surround it. The restaurant is purely made by bamboo betung and very rustic and save.

Take a moment to sit in the veranda, if you are lucky, you will hear the monkeys. The place is really quiet and the nature around is very well preserved.

For food, they provide local food buffet and ala carte. We tried the apple pie, it was perfect. Surprisingly, their robusta bali coffee was also taste good. I can see the restaurant is prepared for proper lunch or early dinner manner with an excellent nature beauty in the bamboo forest.

However, the price to eat in there is quite expensive. You must prepare yourself.

Foe me, this is a place for a quick stop afternoon tea time but can be done once in a while.","A gorgeous warung serving traditional food prepared in clayware, in a tranquil setting above a river. We visited in the dry and the mosquitos weren't too bad at all, but the staff subtly stoked the cooking fires up so that the smoke rose up through the rafters and there were no more mosquitos! It backs onto the jungle on Gunung Batukaru.
The food was soo delicious ðŸ’• cooked too perfection and incredible flavours. Highly recommend.",excellent,This place nestled in a forest with little sinage and a one way tiny road that is muddy and no sight of civilization has the most amazing tasting food. We came right before closing time. We were not rushed and the staff treated us like we were the first patrons there at opening time.  The service was tantalizing. Don't be worried - trust the journey to this great feast.
