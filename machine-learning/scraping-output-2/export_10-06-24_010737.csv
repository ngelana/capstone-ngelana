They have a chicken rice set and pork rice set. Both were good and really affordable. It costs you only 20k each. The meat they provided, the floss, and lawar was excellent. Their sambal is also spicy and nice. Overall, will come to this place again for my next trip.","One of the legendary balinese warung that can be found in Sanur. It is open until late night and they have several menus like nasi campur ayam, nasi campur babi, or even nasi campur ayam dan babi. The place for the food is seperate so if you dont eat babi / pork, it is still fine since they keep seperate between pork and chicken. The parking space also big and you have to pay for the parking fee. The staff is very hospitable and ready to serve you

Spacious parking area are available, they open until after midnight good choice for supper portion.","This place is famos for their Nasi Lawar, one of Bali‚Äôs traditional food. They have chicken and pork for the options. The place is quite far away and the place is like outdoor food stall. The place was visited mostly by locals, it‚Äôs my second time here and I‚Äôve seen no tourist. The taste of the food was very good. If you want to try something new, come here and tru their Nasi Lawar.",Very best for Nasi Campur in here!!! The taste it's not heavy but lite and delicious even small restaurant inside the public market look clean and comfortable. Btw they have picture with artists and my lovely President also.

As I am not a big fan of rice I changed the Chicken Cashew side to Fries.
The oxtail was piping hot, well cooked and very tasty. The Chicken Cashew was served piping hot and well cooked.  The side of fries were the best fries I have eaten in Bali.(8 years) Hot, crispy and plentyful.","I can recommend this Cafe, the food quality is consistently good. The ambience is more practical than cosy or stylish. But better like this than the other way around. You can see and taste that the owner is the chef. Prices are reasonable and the location is still in reach of the main tourist area.","Incredibly delicious cakes for cheap money.

The place appears clean and calm.

I can really recommend Goddes Bakery in Sanur","Lovely place.
Helpful and friendly attentive staff.
Great quality pastry in the danish. Really top drawer stuff.
Good coffee.
Excellent french fries with the tasty sandwich.
Salad dressing was a revalation!! Possibly roasted garlic vinaigrette. A little touch of vanilla this stuff would be 100%

Cons: the shower is leaking when I turn it on. I can't make a difference between a shampoo bottle and a soap bcs there's no name in it.

Bedding is basically a waterproof plastic and pillows stinks. Hair everywhere which are NOT mine. Had to dust off millions of bugs and its parts from bedding for a while before use it. Dirty room, dust and hair at every corner. Shower sucks as well. Hot water for 2 mins then gets cold. Mine does not even has mirror nor tooth brush etc kind of bath kit. Naturally no hair dryer. Breakfast is even more ridiculous. No need to explain the menu, it does not have coffee. For drinks, you have only one option, orange juice. Seriously?? The pool was too dark after sunset to get in. The staff seems totally and totally untrained. I would ever recommand this place. I was way too naive to believe those nice reviews. BTW, I was staying in 2br villa.

My parents are elderly people and they need some assistance. Lina and her mother were always super helpful with everything. I had a good feeling to book an apartment for my parents there because there is always a staff member present and Lina is always available on WhatsApp.

Oxy House is a cozy place with a family atmosphere, a pool and apartments with an own kitchen. Lina and her mum take care about everything, Maxi and Komang are cleaning and maintain the place. All are very welcoming and caring. My parents even got sometimes food from Lina and a cake for my dad's birthday. If there was a problem they responded fast and fixed it.

Oxy House is located in Sanur Kauh which is a less touristic area. If you stay there you can experience local balinese live combined with western standard living. The beach is around 5 minutes by scooter, supermarkets, laundry and some small restaurants are in walking distance.

Would recommend this to anyone looking for a kost. You would struggle to find anywhere better for the money.,"I stayed at Kost Kubu di Carik for many months. I lived in Bali for long time and I changed kost many times until I found this one, which for me is the BEST place I have ever lived in.
The quality/price ratio is absolutely excellent: the kost features new furniture, tiles and finishings, it is fully equipped with AC, hot water, TV, wifi and it also has small kitchen area, wardrobe and a super comfortable bed including very fine quality bedsheets.
The inside of the rooms is very well designed, it is luminous and super clean.
Anyway, I think the best part of this place is the garden and the quiet surrounding: the kost is located at the very end of a super quiet gang and it is facing ricefields.
I will always remember the amazing stunning sunset views as I came back home from a long day of work and the incredible good sleep at night when the only sound is the chant of the crickets :)
Also, the place has only 5 rooms so even when full occupancy it is very very quiet.
Location is north Sanur, only 5 min ride with  bike to the closest beach - Pantai Segara.
Nonetheless, Pak Arya - the owner - is a superb helpful nice man that takes care of the place with dedication and will be there for you when you need help.
I recommend Kost Kubu di Carik with all my heart and I will always remember this place.
If I hadn't decided to go back home, I would definately stay here forever!
