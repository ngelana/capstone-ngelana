You also can try the taste os Special Luwak Coffee for only RP$50k. I love the taste of Luwak Coffee (without sugar) üëçüèºüëçüèº.

The family that welcoming us also so nice & friendly. You also can try the swing at this place (cheaper than swing at Ubud area).","One of the lesser known ""coffee plantations"" or ""padi field"" places, definitely worth a visit over a place like Alas Harum which has really become extremely touristy and somewhat unpalatable.

Luwak coffee here is 50k a cup and there are free tastings of other local specialty drinks as well. We saw actual coffee plants here and Kicen (our guide) took his time to explain to us the history of coffee in bali (from the Dutch) and the difference between arabica and robusta etc

Definitely worth a visit on the way to kintamani",Definitely a secret spot! The owner caught us on the street because our tire was flat. We chatted and he told us about his coffee farm. We followed him and we tasted a lot of coffee and tea for free. He was so kind and showed us his place and could tell us a lot about the process. There was no pressure of buying or feeling uncomfortable. We‚Äôre very grateful for this coincidence. Thank you.,"Nice place to know more about Luwak coffee, taste it, compare to others, and also taste different types of teas. The place has a great view and you get to take some nice pics.","The guy literally invited me to stop by whilst I was on my bike. He made up some stories and was very friendly. I decided that I would have a drink of coffee and enjoy the view. The scenery is pretty amazing but the guy hovered around and didn't really give me space to enjoy the place. He didn't seem to happy that I didn't buy anything and even wanted to give me a 20% off just to get me to but something. As I was leaving, he got on his bike presumably to target someone else."
