Only downside are the many tourist owned dogs who play and fight in between the tables spraying you with sand and trying to steal the food from your plate.

Seafood fried rice is more flavorful than average, the best I had after many nasi gorengs all month in Bali.

Was pleasantly surprised by the mado mado salad, seasoned with a peanut sauce dressing. The vegetables are boiled and served with several slices of tempeh.

It‚Äôs definitely true, the staff are often so rude and make you feel uncomfortable ü´£ I think one factor in this might be the tiny cramped space they have to work in and the fact that they can‚Äôt escape customers (sometimes you need a breather and a wall to hide behind so that you‚Äôre not constantly bombarded with the next customer). Add in that the place is so popular and thus so busy so staff are probably constantly under the pump.

The atmosphere is incredibly inviting, with a cozy tiny building, relaxed vibe that makes it a great spot. The coffee is excellent, and the menu is full of interesting options.

But the best part of this place is the fact that you can bring your dog and place in front of the shop around and play. It's a great way to take a break from your day and spend some quality time, making it a great place to bring your pup for a walk."

location is great too! Far enough from the noise of Canggu, yet close enough to it.
There are only few nice restaurants in the area, but Canggu is only 10 minutes away.

Beach is in 30 meters and the sound of waves can always be heard.
And you can see the ocean from everywhere in the house. Always dreamed to live like this.

Impecable swimming pool

It's so convenient that if you want to get a massage they arrange it very quickly for you to get it in the villa at very affordable prices.

You have the beach at only 50 meters from the villa where you can see beautiful sunsets.

They would also arrange transportation if you want to explore, do excursion. But honestly you feel so good at the villa that you are not going to want to leave

The house and grounds were immaculate, the kitchens and bathrooms were well stocked, and the bed was so comfortable.

Highly recommend for whatever kind of getaway you‚Äôre looking for, this villa certainly will not disappoint!!!","My stay at Villa Alamtaru was an absolute delight, providing me with the perfect opportunity to disconnect from my bustling daily life during my week-long visit. The serenity and captivating aesthetics of the property left a lasting impression. What I truly appreciated was its proximity to charming local restaurants, the beach, and even a Yoga class that I attended. I also embarked on a leisurely one-hour stroll to explore neighboring areas like Seminyak, although it proved to be a tad too chaotic for my personal preference. Nonetheless, returning to this hidden oasis was always a cherished moment of respite.

One of the standout features of this haven was the enchanting white Frangipani tree blossoms, creating a picturesque vista just outside my window. I was enamored by the harmonious blend of antique typical balinese houses that enveloped the larger, modern villa. The room itself was tastefully adorned and remarkably spacious, with a contemporary bathroom that added to the overall comfort of my stay. The bed was particularly inviting, and in the evenings, the considerate staff added a lovely mosquito net, infusing a delightful holiday atmosphere while guaranteeing an undisturbed night's rest, free from bothersome insect encounters. Such meticulous attention to detail was one of the many factors that elevated my stay, rendering it even more memorable.

And, oh, I almost forgot to mention the two pools! They were simply divine, and I wholeheartedly recommend taking a dip to complete your Villa Alamtaru experience."

Short drive from town and surfing minutes away. Loving staff that cooked an amazing breakfast. Beautiful rooms, clean and well maintained. Infinity pool stretching to the rice fields.","The house is worse for wear, riddled with termites, the electricity is incredibly dangerous, plugs explode like firecrackers, trees are falling, palm trees have died, a dilapidated kitchen with no appliances, tattered bed linen and old towels, and as soon as the rainy season starts the roof is leaking, the lounge is flooded with more exploding plugs, bathroom drains exude a putrid stench. The pool turns into a murky green pond, a breeding ground for mosquitoes and frogs, just as the ""water feature fountains"" which are transformed into cesspits and the perfect eyesore.

Initially attracted by amenities like the promised TV, my expectations were completely let down. Despite assurances, the TV was never installed (during my 2 months of stay); the management lady was full of excuses but prompt only when collecting payments. It's easier for them to take rather than to deliver on promises, it seems.

The response from the manager lady was painfully slow. Multiple issues with electricity, water, and door locks were met with delayed responses, taking hours or even days. Unannounced visits by potential renters were another privacy breach that we had to endure, adding to the feeling of disrespect and inconvenience.

A severe incident occurred during a storm when lightning damaged all ground floor lights. The repair was delayed for several days, leaving us in discomfort. Moreover, communication was bottlenecked through the manager, making it impossible to address issues timely with anyone else.

I was (in my view) unfairly charged nearly 2 million IDR from my security deposit for minor paint issues on the stairs, an assessment I found unfair. Additionally, the neighbor's constantly barking dog was a nightmare for the first week. Though this was eventually resolved, it was another testament to the lack of peaceful living conditions.

Overall, my stay was marred by unfulfilled promises, poor management, and unfair charges. I would not recommend Tegal Sari Apartment to anyone seeking a peaceful and reliable place to live. Although Seseh it's a beautiful place, I love it all around there.",,,,
