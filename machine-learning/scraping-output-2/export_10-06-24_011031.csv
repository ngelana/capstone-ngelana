Nusa Penida, Kabupaten Klungkung, Bali 80771, Indonesia",https://maps.google.com/?cid=13479511079565745662,OPERATIONAL,+62 812-3830-4514,hotel,"hotel, lodging",4.7,102,,"absolutely dreamy! The serene and relaxing atmosphere must have been a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. The combination of attentive staff and delicious food likely elevated the experience, ensuring that every aspect of your stay was enjoyable.
Overall, the perfect ideal destination for a tranquil getaway, with all the ingredients for a perfect retreat.","We have been there with two people and had a deluxe twin room. The stuff was super caring so we had a great and relaxing time. We rented a scooter from the hotel wich was pretty fine. They also had good helmets.
Breakfast and dinner were delicious! There could be some more vegetarian options.","The place was beautiful. We got for three nights a Deluxe Suite with two floors. It was a lovely spot, but the large amount of mosquitoes at night interrupted two nights in a row without sleep. The second night, I got bedbugs in the bungalow, and I had at least 100 bites. Dogs were barking nonstop at night near our bungalow, and an animal was nibbling wood on top of us at the roof. I get it! We were in nature, and I love the fact that there are animals, but if you want to sleep and rest, it doesn’t help you.

They need mosquito nets. I have to say the staff were lovely helping us to clean the room, change the sheets, and give us all the mosquito devices. But the reality is that I spent so much money here to have a reset, and I couldn’t rest up.
Also, if you are working online, the wifi doesn’t work in the bungalows further out from reception, so we couldn’t have any wifi from the room.
They didn’t give us a compliment or something, so that I won’t be back to this place ever again.","Our stay there was perfect. The staff was really nice and helped us with all our requests. The location is beautiful, quiet and surrounded by jungle. If you bring mosquito protection you will have a great time there!","If I could choose 6 stars I would definitely do it. This place has everything you need, a wonderful restaurant with amazing food. It’s a shame that I just spent 2 nights here. You can have your breakfast by the pool which is a nice experience.
All staff here are lovely and friendly and they are ready to help you with anything. I highly recommend this place if you are going to nusa penida"
