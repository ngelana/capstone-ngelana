A huge amphiteatre is placed  between the garden and the Pura for the occasional performance. And finally two Garuda statues welcome the worshipers to enter the grand Pura Jagathnata. A huge wooden carved door in the middle entrance and two smaller sizes of bright red carved wooden on both sides showing the granduer of the place. A neatly maintance green yard decorated with frangipanis tree makes the place even more special.
