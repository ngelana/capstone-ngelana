The portions are incredibly generous, and the coffee is excellent ‚Äì just what you want from a proper cafe. They even offer free drinking water, which is a fantastic touch. We tried the Mexican burrito, pasta, cappuccino, and flat white ‚Äì everything was absolutely delicious, a perfect 10 out of 10. The owner and staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making the whole experience even better. I absolutely adore tiny places that offer exceptional hospitality. The prices are reasonable as well ‚Äì what more could you ask for? Thank you for being such a great spot! üíô",Came across this gem by accident. And sure glad we did! The coffee was brilliant after spending days in Munduk where you couldn‚Äôt find a good one. And the most delicious strawberry crepe you‚Äôll ever have. The owner is so cute and the establishment is also really nice. I am going to have to find my way back here before I leave ! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,"The best warung in Bedugul area. The owner Tante, is a great cook! Her food is delicious.

The Ratatouille pasta dish is a mush try! Her homemade jams and caramel also very tasty.","I recently had the pleasure of visiting The Lost Cafe in Bali, and I can't stop raving about the incredible experience! From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality that made us feel right at home.

The food at The Lost Cafe is nothing short of marvelous. My wife opted for the Soto Ayam, a dish that surpassed all expectations. The generous portion, coupled with the rich and flavorful gravy, made it a standout. Unlike anything we've had in Singapore, it came with both noodles and rice on the side ‚Äì a delightful surprise.

On the chef's recommendation, I tried the Mango Tuna Salad Sandwich, and it was a crispy, filling delight. The flavors were exquisite, and I couldn't help but marvel at the combination of ingredients. We're self-proclaimed soto lovers, and the Soto Ayam at The Lost Cafe is on a whole new level.

The real star, though, was the magical sambal that accompanied the Soto. The kick it delivered was irresistible, and we found ourselves ordering three extra bottles to take back home to Singapore. Trust me, one serving is never enough!

The Lost Cafe is not just a dining spot; it's a unique experience. Located an hour's drive from Ubud in the Monkey Forest area, the journey is well worth it. The second level offers a bird's eye view of the picturesque surroundings, and we even had the pleasure of sharing the space with a friendly family of chickens.

The Lost Cafe is more than a cafe; it's a priceless souvenir of hospitality, great company, and unforgettable flavors. Whether you're planning to explore Bedugul onwards or just passing through, make sure to include this gem in your itinerary. You'll be left LOST for words!

#LostCafe #BaliEats #FoodieParadise","Small cafe run by the owner and few local ladies helping in the kitchen.
All breakfast we had was amazing! Most of the food they make themselves, the strawberry jam.. the waffle, bread n more! Really tasty n the coffee eventhou it‚Äôs with a small machine, believe me the taste wouldn‚Äôt disappoint you! I had iced americano!
Yes it has lots of flies when we were there, a bit annoying tbh, but the hospitality, the coffee n the food they‚Äôre just too great n worth it. My friends n I were so glad that we stopped there for breakfast."

I spend around 2 hours there wandering all alone. Got creeped out a few times because of some sounds üòÇ","Typical for Bali. The Balinese, who decided to make money illegally, built a gate at the entrance to the hotel, and only lets you in for 100,000, saying that this is property!  if it is private property, then no one should enter the hotel grounds, even if you pay.  We refused to pay and just left.  Deception!  Do not sponsor scammers!!!",You can get lost there for hours. Impressive to see how nature is slowly eating the infrastructure. We couldn't get the price under 100k for two though but we really wanted to go so we end up paying that.,"+ unusual atmosphere, beautiful views from the balconies
- the locals are not allowed without entrance fees (standard for Balinese ransomware)/ 100000 for two persons"

If any chance to stay there please bring your own sleeping bag because the matress was very thin.

Perfect for couple or family retreat. The only thing you need is just asking. Sadly you won't find a good signal unless you have a good provider.,Good place.. they have good view of many hills and mountain.. valur for money.. helpfull staff.. its hard to find food.. better bring ur own food.. not many toilet.. we can cooking by our self and borrow their kitchen..standard tent and equipment.. good to bring kids and learn about nature.. they have their on track for ATV.. they have some spot for selfie.. the access to go there is not good.. better using motorbike,"I really recommend as spectacular destination.

Tofu , Satay were not tasty other oily.

View is good though but one goes to restaurant for food. And also staff difficult to converse in English while we generally go assuming atleast some staff will be conversant.

Finally card machine didn't accept Google pay do had to shell out cash. On top of this you pay 10% service charge which wasn't worth even half of that.

I don't recommend.",This is the place you wanna be if you want to enjoy a peaceful meal and choose from a wide variety of different foods.
