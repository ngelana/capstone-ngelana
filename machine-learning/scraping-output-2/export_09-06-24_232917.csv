For me the teas were amazing with strong flavor. Bought a couple of coffee and tea bags. Really good place to hang out. Cool views.,You pay 50k for a coffee which includes a little tour explaining how they make the coffee and tastes of different types of tea and coffee. Be aware of the mosquitos and I don‚Äôt give 5 stars only because they have a luwak in a cage just for the tourists.,"You can see coffe plantations, owner will guide through the garden, show everything. Here are one Luwak in cage for you to see. You can taste all kinds of tea and coffe flawors here. Thats all fo free! We bought Luwak coffe to drink and some souveniers.","Luwak coffee, regular coffee, tea with different flavours, spices. Luwak was sleeping but excursion was nice. The guide told us all about the coffee making process. Luwak coffee is definitely stronger, more bitter, more aromatic than regular coffee. It's worth trying!","We had a great guide explaining us the whole process, followed by a very thorough tasting of tea's and coffee with an amazing view over the forest. The property has so many fruits and roots growing. Great place!"
