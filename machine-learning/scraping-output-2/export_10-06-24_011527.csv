It was very interesting to watch for 3 weeks, first the clutch of eggs, then the chicks, how they grow, how the bird comes and feeds them. The palm tree was low, lower than the balcony, every other tree in the street was taller and wider than this palm tree. Suddenly, beyond all logic, it was cut down, the nest thrown onto a bush, the dead chicks lying along the road. I roar all day long.

Of rationality: the internet doesn't pull calls or YouTube videos in minimal quality. Rooms are old, the door to the bedroom does not close, bed linen and towels often with stains, cleaning is poor quality and is carried out by dirty and smelly rags after which every time you need to open all the windows and ventilate the room because the stench is unbelievable.","Great place to stay at Nusa Dua!  Great facility, warm hospitality, and easy access to highway!    (Pro tip:  try to swim at night, the pool water is warm :) )",Stayed at a different hotel but venue of event was here. Thank you to the security guards who let me borrow their personal motorcycle to buy for my wife's napkin. Neareat store was almost a kilometer away (near amaroossa hotel).,The place is good but unfortunately car access is very bad. Too many motorbikes parked on the side of the road. I could barely pass the second corner before the spa because there were parked motorbikes.,"Bad lazy and slow service.
Not really quality food with mosquito inside;(
Very slow internet, but you can pay more for get faster (sounds like scam)

The photo shown in the booking is hiding the ugly with its angle. Also the toilet does not look clean. There are rusta over the screws in it and you can see the rust leaking down the toilet bowl (inside of it). You get free breakfast. Pretty decent I'd say. As I arrived to check-in, around 2:30pm(check-in time is 2pm) I didn't get my room until like 3:30pm. Took so long to get my room ready. I did asked for a late check out of an hour extra, they said no problem. I also had a massage service, they have a room in the hotel to do it. It's not free. The hotel is 30mins away from Savaya Beach Club and an hour away from Finns Beach Club. Also, the door for the shower glass room does not close properly. The room is nice, nothing fancy fancy. But for what I paid? I would've gotten a better experience and quality in other hotels and villas for the same price or even cheaper.","I am writing to express my profound disappointment and dismay regarding the recent experience my group encountered during our stay at your establishment. As the organizer of a group booking comprising 28 rooms for my guests, I am deeply troubled by the substandard conditions and misleading representations that marred our stay.

Despite the assurances provided by the photographs on your website, the reality of our accommodations was far from satisfactory. Upon arrival, it became immediately apparent that the rooms were not only misrepresented but also grossly neglected in terms of cleanliness and maintenance.

The presence of mold in the showers and air conditioning units, alongside rusty equipment, underscored a severe lack of attention to hygiene and upkeep. Additionally, the blankets provided in numerous rooms were riddled with cigarette burns, posing a health hazard to our guests and demonstrating a blatant disregard for their comfort and well-being.

To our shock and dismay, several rooms were infested with bugs, both in the bedding and emerging from the water sources. This not only compromised the quality of our stay but also raised serious concerns about the overall sanitation and pest control measures within your premises.

Moreover, the absence of water in the morning further exacerbated our grievances, leading to significant inconvenience and disruption to our plans. As a result of these intolerable conditions, a staggering 75% of our guests chose to check out either on the same day of arrival or the following day.

This mass exodus speaks volumes about the extent of our dissatisfaction and the urgent need for you to address these issues promptly and comprehensively. It is unacceptable for a reputable 4 star hotel to mislead customers with false representations and fail to uphold basic standards of cleanliness and hospitality.

I implore you to take immediate corrective action to rectify these deficiencies and prevent future guests from enduring similar hardships. Restoring our faith in your establishment will require tangible improvements and a genuine commitment to excellence in service and accommodation.

I eagerly await your response and assurances that appropriate measures will be taken to remedy this egregious situation.","In balcony they keep AC outdoor units so you can‚Äôt use balconies because they are very hot.
Rooms are good but need to replace sanitary equipment.
In breakfast they don‚Äôt have Indian food.
For Indian food you have to go outside 4 to 5 km.","Our weekend getaway was so much fun! Lots to see and eat  in such a short period of time.  The hotel is awesome with very friendly and attentive staff, always ready to assist. We booked a pool suite which was wonderful. Breakfast was included and they had this fried fish to die for. A massage is also available by appointment and it was for me the highlight of our short stay as it left me so refreshed and ready for our flight home. On our last night, we had dinner at the rooftop - all to ourselves! Kudos to the manager and staff. Thanks so much! Highly recommended especially for families with children."

After my first experience there that resulted in a 2-star review, I decided to give it a second try and I‚Äòm glad I did! This time the service personnel was super friendly and the food is good at a very reasonable price. It‚Äôs a really nice place and I would recommend going there.

Previous review:
The place looks nice, 2 stars for that and the fact that I don‚Äôt know all the employees. But I was severely disappointed with the service that was non-existent. I wanted to get some food, and after waiting upstairs, I decided to go downstairs so they wouldn‚Äôt forget to take my order. Again, I waited in vain. The worst part was that when I went to the counter and asked if there was no table service, the woman just waved her hand at me because she was busy doing something else. An absolute no-go!","We stayed here for two nights and it was really nice. Everything was good! The staff was super nice and helpful, the rooms were super clean and the food was good. Highly recommended üëå",My wife and I came here for a coffee. They have oat milk! ü§© loved it! Banana Freitas are amazing too!!,"First time try this place and surprisingly all of the food that we ordered was amazing delicious. I ordered creamy mushroom soups, this is will be my favorite, super tasty. Fettuccine carbonara also delicious and the pork burger. And very affordable price for this portion.
