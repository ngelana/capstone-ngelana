The staff and owner were so helpful and accommodating. In a peaceful yet perfect location to everything. Would recommend 100%,"Great place to stay. Central on the island, so takes time getting to places (I think it‚Äôs the same anywhere on the island). The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean, modern and looked after. Food at the restaurant was nice and well priced. Scooter hire available too for a fair price! I think we may have been overcharged on our tab, which is a shame, but either way was a lovely place to stay. 5 stars","It is a beautiful place in nature. And a perfect ‚Äúhome base‚Äù for exploring the island. It has a great view, relaxing vibes, nice communal space, and great service.
The price-quality ratio is good. I am looking forward to returning one day and would recommend this place for any trip - long and short stay.",Nice accommodation and location. Very relaxing with kampong environment üëç,
