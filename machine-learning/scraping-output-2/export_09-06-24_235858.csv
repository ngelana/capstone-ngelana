It‚Äôs a must go if you‚Äôre around, you‚Äôll be welcomed with the best smile and energy ever.
I had food here basically every night after meeting this restaurant, I‚Äôll still go today and tomorrow and until I leave hopefully. So grateful, HO YEAHHHH","Went to this place for dinner because of the great reviews but I was disappointed unfortunately. We ordered the Butter Chicken and the Veggie Nasi Goreng. The ladder looked very loveless and was completely cold. After letting the owner know he got very angry and almost screamed at me that that‚Äôs impossible. Sad to see that constructive feedback is handled so unprofessionally. Last but not least, the place is much more expensive than other local food places (Nasi Goreng 45k, Nasi Campur 70k). You can find better food for a better price in Medewi üëçüèª","A very nice and friendly restaurant run by a husband and wife couple
All the food is delicious and served quickly
A local told me this is the best restaurant in the area, and it's true","I found Rasta Cafe just two days before leaving Medewi, and I wish k had discord it sooner!.

I‚Äôve dined in couple of times and I have to say the guy is super friendly and very attentive.

Food is fantastic, very fresh and bursting with flavour. I don‚Äôt remember the name but I tried two typical desserts that were fantastic.","Taco Tuesday was great! Others ate regular menu which was also really good. The dessert was amazing, made with coconut not too old, not too young! Great atmosphere, extra friendly owners and staff. Great vibe"

Will come back when around Medewi. üëç","I have been in Medewi for a couple of days now and eating at a few different places.

This spot is by far the best I have eaten, and everything has been delicious! From the breakfast all day, to the lunch, to the dinner with tasty milkshake!

Not only is the food incredible, but the staff is so kind and attentive. The atmosphere really is nice too. The music and interior design really round this place out to be one of my favorite restaurants I have eaten at during my stay in Bali!

If you don't go here while in Medewi, you are seriously missing out!","Aussie review.
Food was perfect, tasted amazing, was delivered still piping hot. We went to a resort for lunch today 3x the price and this food was better. Pasta was better than in Australia, and I'm a chef by trade. Out of two trips to Bali this would have to be the best westernised food we have eaten here ü´∂

Also thank you Avocado Resto for the present added to our order. We forgot to pack a drink bottle so was the perfect gift!! Have a happy and healthy new year!! ","Avocado Resto is hands down the best restaurant in Medewi for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Their awesome smoothies and juices are a must-try, and their great pastry selection will satisfy any sweet tooth. The very friendly staff adds to the welcoming atmosphere, making every visit a delightful experience. Highly recommended for anyone looking for delicious food in a beautiful setting","One of the best in Medewi ‚Ä¶.food is imaginative, beautiful presented and overall delicious and healthy. Prices are very reasonable given the quality and amazing attention to detail. Decor is also very well done with open views to the rice paddies and good selection of classic motorbikes for the IG shots! Highly recommended.."

Staff are all super friendly and attentive.
5 minutes to the point and 8 minutes to the beach for surfing etc
2 restaurants right on the doorstep
Great value","Stayed here for three nights. Eddy and his family made us feel so welcomed very kind family and was always willing to help us out, they also organises mopeds for us to use during the stay which was very helpful.The rooms  were very nice with the door opening up to the view of the pool. Each morning you get a different homemade breakfast which is very good."

Fully equipped kitchen with a pool table/pingpong and games, the pool is refreshing. I have truly admired the quality that has been put in building the bungalows.
I accidently put my booking a day later than upon arrival, this was no problem. We were greeted warmly by Cynthia and were able to book for the same night as well.
Marcus is an excellent host and helped us out a lot when the internet was not working well. (I would not recommend staying in Pulukan general if you need full speed internet for your work)

Further more, easy scooter rental, easy acces to drinks that you pay later on, free water, a hammock at your door, beautiful garden.. its refreshing to stay here.","Very peaceful location and garden, beautiful bungalows with outside shower, very quick scooter ride away from the beach break ++ lovely hosts.","Great place. Room we stayed in was  sober. But a good shower with good bed, sleeps well, very quiet place. A lot of dogs (they are friendly). Beautiful garden. The owners make the difference, they are nice and helpfull. You can rent a bike or scooter. I say book there! We felt very welcome.","Beautiful location and tranquil setting. The wifi is not the best, but if that's not important it's such a cozy, beautiful space- felt like home but better, haha.","My advice is check if it meets your needs before booking for longer than a couple of nights. The reviews are mostly false and don‚Äôt tell you anything about the place.
I booked long term because the owners assured me their place had good internet speed for online work and was quiet, with only some noise from the mosque, which, they said, could be compared to a church bell. In reality, prayers on loudspeakers go on for half an hour to an hour, starting at 4:30am every day. WiFi speed is below 10mbs, mostly around 5mbs.
If you need to work, don‚Äôt plan on renting the bungalow. The bungalow is a sauna during the day no matter the AC. As the houses are a few meters apart with the common area in the middle, your work depends on what the other guests and the owners are doing.
For those who want to use the kitchen, be prepared for student flatshare standards plus cats and dogs walking all over the tables and counters.
I met guests who seemed okay with the place. Other guests, like me, wanted to move out but the owners refused to return their money.
The staff and guests were lovely so the vibe was good generally. But the place is not as described.

PS. After I left the review they threatened they‚Äôd report me to the immigration office for working illegally on Bali. That‚Äôs the spirit!"

Great location just a few minutes from the surf. Rooms were comfortable and clean. Our hosts were absolutely incredible! We surfed together every day and ate together every night. We are so grateful to have been welcomed into this beautiful family. If you‚Äôre planning a surf trip to Medewi, definitely check out the Pink Barrel ü©∑","We are spending 12 days at Pink Barrel and loving it here. It locates at the heart of Medewi with less than 5 mins motorbike ride to the Point. Both the bungalow and the room on the 2nd floor that we‚Äôre staying are specious, clean, and comfortable. The internet is fast.

Reza, Rika, Mikael, and Raya are wonderful host. Not to mention Rika‚Äôs exceptional cooking I recommend you to try. Motorbike rental and surf classes are also available. Everything is convenient for us for our entire stay. I strongly recommend Pink Barrel to everyone who wants to come to Medewi ü§ç","Home away from home.
We had such a fantastic time at pink barrel, that we ended up staying there twice.

Mikael, Reza & Tika and all the pink barrel crew immediately made us feel like at home. They helped us with all matters, from organizing a driver to renting scooters; incl. surfboard racks.

One of the highlights next to amazing waves and surf spots are the daily dinners on site! We are vegetarian and Tikas food was the best we had in whole Bali.
We cannot recommend it more! It‚Äôs the perfect place if you‚Äôre looking for a surf, eat, sleep kind of experience.
We will def. come back!","You must come to Pink Barrel when visiting Medewi, I knew within minutes of arriving that i'll be coming back. The garden is stunning, the bungalows are amazing and the pool + views are something else.
Takes less than a couple minutes to scooter down to the beach to check the surf, and if you can't find your scooter key then it's barely a 15 min walk.
As a surfer it was great to rely on the local knowledge that Mikael and Reza provide.
There's a daily opt-in system for partaking in dinner, where you'll share a table with any other guests and Mikael/Reza. The food was a 10/10 every evening.
They've got a lovely set up at Pink Barrel and you'll feel welcome in no time at all.","The ABSOLUTE BEST SPOT IN MEDEWI! I spent one month here and was of the best places I‚Äôve ever stayed in Bali. The cutest bungalow with the most amazing view of the rice fields, an amazing desk to work (again overlooking the rice fields) and a big deck to chill and do some yoga. Also everyone in pink barrel treated me like family. Best place ever."

The whole family is kind, well educated and truly welcoming. You will be surrounded by nature and good vibes the whole stay, on top of being 5 mins away to medewi center and the main beach.

Also, if you have any pain in your body, the father is a true healer and will make your pain go away, guaranteed. I had shoulder pain for the last 3 months, I've tried physios, chiropractors and more, he cured it in 30 mins massage therapy.

I highly recommend and I'll be back for sure!","Nice place with great atmosphere, close to Medewi Beach and wonderful people who will make you feel part of their family.
Super tasty food, they will help you find bikes, surfboards (which were given a discount for staying at this homestay) and even a hairdresser came to cut out hair!
Unbeatable experience in Bali, we will surely come back!","Was okay to stay but when we arrived (after our booking was confirmed) they told us the room we booked wasn‚Äôt available and had to go into a better room- BUT at an extra charge to us. We don‚Äôt think this is correct as it is their fault. The food from Mama is lovely we had a large feast with chicken, barracuda, calamari, rice vegetables etc. with some other people. It just felt like it was all about getting more money from you unfortunately. Is in a really good location for Medewi only 2 minutes by scooter to the beach.","The rooms are traditionally made with bamboo and wood in such a way as the air blows through. I much prefer this connection to nature than sitting in an air conditioned box. Better in an earthquake too. Showering outside feels great!

Some of the best boards are available to rent here (Trinity). They can help arrange a scooter too. The cooking is good as well.

I forgot how relaxing it is here.
Enjoy.","Our stay here was the highlight  of our trip to Bali. Mama and  Uges are wonderful people. Mamas evening meals were a real treat. Downside is witnessing the rudest guest showing Mama complete disrespect because breakfast wasnt on the table immediatley. Mama was an absolute star throughout and showed alot more restraint then i would. Uges(magic hands) massage was amazing also. Cannot recommend this place enough.Beautiful family, rooms, setting, ambience and vibe. 3 min drive on scooter to surf beach.  Big thanks guys. ‚ù§ see you again for sure ü§û"

The villa is decorated beautifully with lovely rooms, access to the pool, kitchen, lounge, TV and good WiFi. The beach is a 2 minute scooter ride away or ten minute walk and is surrounded by rice fields and a view to the mountains. There are excellent restaurants near by (I would recommend Rasta and Dewis place just up the road) and there are waterfalls and temples roughly 30min scooter ride away.
