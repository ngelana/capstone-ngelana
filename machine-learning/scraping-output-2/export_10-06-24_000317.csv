Niente immediately feels like home when you walk in. The house-turned hotel has been beautifully restored, and every room is unique. They also really took care of us here with their home cooked Italian and Indonesian meals and impeccable service.

I've been in Bali for a few days now but arriving here really makes it feel like a holiday. Waking up to a flood of lush green and the sound of nature is a true Bali experience.

Already looking forward to coming back!","Absolutely amazing experience with one of the most beautiful views in all of Bali.

Warm and professional service made our stay truly relaxing, everything is taken care of. Uniquely restored buildings with a vibe I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere else on the island.

Fantastic Italian and Indonesian food with a top-notch wine list round up the Niente experience.","I can't say enough good things about this accommodation. It's situated in a beautiful spot, very peaceful and picturesque. Initially, I was unsure about my exact check-in time and day. However, after contacting them directly, I received a quick response from the owner, who, undisturbed by my inconvenience, offered me flexibility, which greatly relieved my stress. The accommodation is conveniently a short distance from the Penebel town centre. Upon arrival, I was greeted by friendly staff who were also very accommodating.

The room was spotlessly clean, and the quality of the building was very good. It's evident that the owners have invested a lot of pride in maintaining the quality of this place.

The bed is one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in, and the quality of the blankets and pillows contributed to an excellent night's sleep.

The shower pressure was great, and the hot water was nice and constant.

After waking up from a big sleep-in, the staff offered breakfast, which was delicious.

The coffee was great!

I extended my stay for a second night, and the owner was very accommodating with this request as well.

I could easily stay here much longer.

There is a great variety of rooms, making it suitable for solo travelers or groups, as there are different room size options to suit everyone.

I felt compelled to leave a positive review so others can come and experience this piece of comfort in a beautiful location for themselves.

I can't recommend this place enough.",Amazing spot with a great vibe and exceptionally welcoming hosts. The home cooked Italian food is some of the best i've had! Also not far from the famous Jatiluhi rice terraces for some beautiful walking :),"Most beautiful. As newly weds, going there was peaceful and relaxing. Felt so comforted being surrounded by the jungle...
The sound of the river...just breathtaking.

The food, wow...absolutely incredible ü¶ãüôèüèΩ

Thank you so much for this very much needed getaway ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

A beautiful hidden gem in the midst of nature. Greatly maintained and super clean! Brothers Kodek and Wayan and the staff were amazingly accommodating and helpful, providing all help you could possibly need. They even helped us with setting up a few of our tents which we brought ourselves and helped lighting up the BBQ for us, which you could by the way rent including charcoal and wood! The service was phenomenal! We even got a walkie talkie so we would be able to call a staff member from our sleeping spot which was further down, up the hill.

Enjoyed every meal thoroughly. The garden and terrace setting is lush and intimate. Sate Lilet is the best I‚Äôve had, lovely glaze and no weird cartilage ‚Äúbits‚Äù. Sambal has the perfect flavor to spice kick balance. Chicken Mediterranean with the rosemary garlic sauce is divine. Bacon and espresso at breakfast are top notch too. Happy belly!","Striking a perfect balance between comfort and simplicity, enhanced by the beauty of Balinese nature, Nient√© seamlessly integrates its exquisite natural design with the jungle surroundings, resulting in a tranquil and rejuvenating atmosphere.
During my stay in the Jungle Room, I experienced the enchanting presence of firebugs at night, and each morning I enjoyed the sight of the sun slowly illuminating the land.
The owners show exceptional care in making you feel at home, presenting a delightful variety of homemade Italian and Indonesian flavors.","We love eating here we drive up to Penebel on the weekends its nearby to Jati Luwih. All the food is good but our favourite is the lasagne, theres coffee and great wines also.","On our way to Bedugul , we stopped to have some good food at this Restaurant by Niente. The atmosphere of this restaurant is quite interesting. There are also hotels to stay. The food served is also delicious at reasonable prices. The staff are also friendly and polite.","All the food here are amazing! They serve the best croissant and they make their own jam which is super! Their wine collection is perfect and the staff are kind, really helpfull. I eat many kind of food on the menu, and no dissapointment. 10/10 should be one of the place you visit when you in bali!"
