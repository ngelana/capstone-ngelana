You will probably have seen the photos of it on many travel blogs, brochures or on social media, but it’s even more impressive in person. The beautiful water palace features well-maintained gardens, with water features, flowers and temples. There are lots of scenic spots for photos, and it’s worth taking the time to explore.

One of the highlights is the abundance of fish in the pools. Buying some fish food allows you to feed the colorful koi – some of which are gigantic.

Whether you're interested in history, nature, or simply a scenic spot to unwind, Tirta Gangga is worth a visit.","The Water Palace is stunningly beautiful. The layout of the water pools and gardens is beautiful, inviting, and restful (assuming you get there before it gets crowded.) It's amazing that all the pools are fed from one spring. To get the most out of your experience, I recommend getting a guide who can explain the history and details of each section. Definitely worth the time to visit.",Nice temple with a big garden and water area where one can walk on a stoned pathway paved on the water area. Can easily spend an hour or so walking around. Small shops outside the temple for some quick shopping / souvenirs.,What a beautiful experience! I did not expect it would be as beautiful as it was. The feeding of the fish was the absolute highlight. The stones in the water makes a very picturesque view. I definitely recommend a visit. Perfect to combine with a visit to the gates of heaven.,"Wonderful garden with beautiful structures and tons of fishes, some of them super huge. Very well maintained and clean campus. Lots of photo spots across. Food for fishes is available readily. Clean toilets are also present free of charge. Entrance fees may feel a bit costly, but it's ok for a one time visit."

I just wanted to have a rest with a nice coffee. At entrance, they persuaded me to buy their coffee tasting while I wasn’t interested. Then they put pressure on me saying if I didn’t buy it, I would have to pay 75,000 entrance fee anyways. Then a guy took me inside and guided me to a pavilion for coffee tasting. Their cups were super dirty. Because we made our move very fast, I didn’t have time to take photos. I thought after my coffee, I could take my time to walk around and to take photos. However, as soon as I finished the coffee, that guy pointed me to the exit door and wanted me to leave. I said I wanted to take some photos, then he showed me his angry face. This place only wants tourists money, nothing else. As soon as they get the money, they want you out.","You can experience the swing here at 200k for 3 different types of swings. 75k if just want to walk in and take photos only. This place is huge and better than any swing you experience in the Ubud area. There are a lot of things to take photos with. You just can't get bored with this place. The only issue is the place is very far. The location is not very strategic. Due to this issue, they have very few customers and we are able to enjoy their hospitality and good service compared to the Aloha Swing at Ubud which they are chasing you off.

P.S: Dress renting is available at 150k rupiah.","We visited for lunch which was included in a tour of the eco-agriculture site.

Absolutely fabulous in its diversity of produce and quality of food served.

Well worth taking the time to travel out and immerse yourself in a part of Balinese lifestyle.","Beautiful rice terraces! A MUST to visit if you are in the area!!!

We had a guided tour and we’re given such great information about how they grow rice and maximize the land.  There are several great photo stations with the beautiful valley behind.

You can book a small tent to overnight if you’d like. This is a GEM in Bali.

We went with our tour guide from  the Griya Resorts in Amed. Kadek Pena did an AMAZING job and knows every corner of this area of Bali.  Perfect English!!","Very beautiful village with a stunning view! They have traditional balinese houses, a kitchen and other things there. The guide was very friendly and answered all questions. They have sun hats for free to wear there! It was a very nice experience with much new information about the balinese people and the culture. ‘Showering’ under the waterfall was great to cool down. Drinks were also very good."

There are a few local restaurants close by if you feel like a walk, heads up tho, the road outside is busy and narrow.

Nice place to stay with delightfully helpful staff.","So nice view with rice terraces, walking distance to Tirta Ganga Temple and 15 min ride to Lempunyang temple. A good location two stay 2-3 days for east island exploration","I had an incredible stay at AlamGangga Villas in Bali. The rooms were not only comfortable but also exquisitely designed, making me feel right at home.

The highlight, though, was the breathtaking view from my room. I woke up to picture-perfect vistas of lush greenery. It felt like a slice of paradise.

The staff at AlamGangga Villas were incredibly helpful and went above and beyond to ensure my stay was memorable. Their warm hospitality made me feel like a valued guest throughout my visit.

The culinary experience was equally outstanding. The on-site restaurant served delicious, authentic Balinese cuisine that left my taste buds delighted.

Overall, AlamGangga Villas provided a perfect blend of comfort, natural beauty, attentive staff, and delectable food. I can't wait to return to this slice of Balinese paradise.","DON'T GO THERE.

Complained to the waitress to give to the chef. Of course, there was no response. I have left pictures  as proof. I also let the waitress know I would be making a public post as the chef seemed proud to send this to a table.  Do not place business here. Plenty of local warung that DESERVE your business. Bill was 430, but with 21% plus 3% to pay by card, it ended up over 520 . Basically, the more food and drinks you purchase, the more you are punished. SHAME ON YOU.

I dont care how 'nice' the view is (average at best). Being harassed in your carpark made me forget the view.",The portion was small. Not worth with the price. Take quite long for the meal.

Beautiful house and so quiet after the Water Palace closes. A swim in the Holy pool is a perfect way to end the day.,"This small guesthouse is great value for money, in a convenient location. The rooms consist of a series of bungalows in a pretty garden, just across the road from the entrance to the water palace. The larger ""deluxe"" bungalows have hot water in the bathrooms and large front porches with a sun lounger, a table and two chairs (the buildings are mostly built duplex-style, so you have 1 wall shared with the next door unit, but you don't hear much noise from next door, and there's a divider separating your side of the porch from theirs). The smaller standard bungalows are cold water bathrooms and their porches are slightly smaller, with chairs but no lounger. Everything is clean and the beds are comfy, and being in the hills, you don't need AC at night. The bed was made up with a blanket and no top sheet, but they were happy to provide a second sheet upon my request. The prices are really good value (probably because this place isn't listed in the Lonely Planet type guide books) and the old guy who runs it is very friendly and welcoming, and picked fresh flowers from his garden to bring to my room after I checked in. He also acts as a guide, but it wasn't really a hard sell (he noticed my hiking boots and asked if I wanted to go out with a guide, but that was it). There is a little bit of noise from the main road, but I suspect as the town is so small, you'll get that noise almost everywhere in town. Overall, I was very happy with my stay here.","The room was alright for the price, it seemed a bit dated no ac but u get what u paid for.

We looked at the menu but it was not written anywhere, but she kept insisting that we should pay that.
Overall good spot and drinks, but service should be improved…",After a long wait in lempuyang temple we arrived to this restaurant at 2pm. To our surprise we were able to get Indian food. Tasted well and freshly made. The price also reasonable. Highly recommended.

Average built ambiance and serves local cuisine food. Staff service was average, usually they are away from customers and when we see them, they will come and check the requirements. We tried Indonesian Chicken curry cooked in banana leaf with Rice and fruit punch. Food was tasty and can try few items from menu.","Worst meal in Bali. Spaghetti or Fettuccine was offered, only Spaghetti was available. The sauce was fluid. Really, never seen such a fluid sauce on Spaghetti. The fish was way too salty, the french fries were tasting like raw flour, no taste at all. Portions were small, as you can see. Very overpriced, awful food. Service was okay. But there are many better restaurants very close. Avoid this one.","Visited this restaurant today 14/3/2023. My tour guide told me, it's relatively famous. I didint had chance to Google at that point &  I was famished. So, ordered Indonesian Curry Chicken .

Food came. Didint know how Indonesian Curry look like nor I have eaten any in Bali. But, the look of the dish is not appetising. Gravy was diluted. Chicken was dry. Bland !
( To each their own. I didint like the meal)

And service tax is 21% !

Hugely disappointed 😞","Terrible food to say the least, as was the convention between the restaurant and the guide: I paid 10+ pounds (200 thousand IDR) for a disgusting chicken curry, in an ultra-mini portion, plus a Coke zero. The worst dining experience in Bali.","Amazing food and service. Great atmosphere.

Thanks"

The nasi goreng was amazing, one of the best I've tried!!!
The lassies are made wite Goat milk, so just be sure you like that.
The cappuccino was very good!
As a dessert I tried the banana pudding, as you can see on the photo. It is quite special, not my favourite but nice 😊 the banana's are quite ""hard"" and the pudding is a bit like a warm sweet soup 😊","Very nice Warung, the owners very friendly the food amazing we had a local treatment 😀 we really appreciated! Thank you

A cuddle to the puppy dog 🐕","Excellent, excellent, very tasty food and very kind service.
Green Papaya salad is quite unique with spicy/sweet sauce. Tuna Fish filet grilled in banana leaf - super yammy with sambal matah. Steamed pork (a la carte „chinese parfum“) is delicious. Bottle of black rice wine adds to the value!:)
Highly recommended! We have stayed in the village for 4 days and most our meals were in this warung. We live in Asia so we know local food. The owners and cooking style are great examples of true hospitality and home made Balinese food. We Will definitely return. Thanks lot!!!","Great family run restaurant. We had some nice conversations with the owners and felt quite welcome.
Food was also great and the prices were very reasonable.
We can definitely recommend coming here.",Excellent food and good prices. Family owned restaurant with a view on the ricefield and 50m from Tirta Gaanga. Excellent service from Gede!
