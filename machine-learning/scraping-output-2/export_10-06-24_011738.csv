The room that l was there's no toilet door. Just share with an extremely close person. Raw toilet with no place to hang clothes and towel. Room had simple facilities and there's no chair or a table. Plenty of mosquitos and bees. Bed did a irritated noise when we move on during the night. Best thing: breakfast place l had an amazing view to the ocean and place is fantastic.,The staff was nice. But the door to our room had some shotty construction. Bugs come in at out and crawl all over you.  At least in room 3. I didn't get any sleep. Worst stay in bali. I might as well have gone camping. At least i can keep the bugs out of my tent.,"Amazing location (the view on top of the hill offers a great panoramic view of the sea and sunset).

The place is a hidden gem : peacefull and full of vegetation, it is really pretty.

The restaurant is amazing : great view and great meals.

The only disappointing part was the room : really wide and mostly empty... The wall are a bit dirty (mold...) but the beds were really confortable anyway.

You can rent scooters directly at the reception and book for the Kecak Dance at the Uluwatu Temple and then avoid the queue.","Location was very bad, there was nothing nearby that you could walk to.
We stayed for 5 nights and they never came to change the towels and clean.
Œ§he wifi was not working most of the time.
Œ§here wasn't even a door in the bathroom, they only had a curtain.
Œ§he restaurant was very dirty, they brought us cutlery with ants","A little bit far from restaurants etc. but close to the Uluwatu temple.

The room is okay, BUT I don't like the bathroom at all. There is no door, just a curtain so no privacy. Indeed a problem If you don't travel alone. If you take a shower, everything gets wet ... The toilet seat also moves as soon as you sit down and there is no space to put your shampoo, toothpaste etc.

The scooter costs 100k/day. Usually I payed 70-80k, so it's kinda expensive."

We got grilled tuna Indonesian style and chicken with peanut sauce Indonesian style. We ate too fast to take photos üôà

Staff are sweet.

Must try!","Dinner was good, had the chicken with mushroom sauce and Greek salad. Breakfast was very disappointing. French toast was basically just dry buttered bread. I was surprised since everyone suggested going for breakfast.","Right next, at main street, to nyang nyang beach you might find loca warung a wonderful little place to grab either an Indonesian or wester dish. Prices for both are absolutely reasonable and fair, service very friendly and the food tasty.

We had Indonesian style chicken with rice, chicken satay and some pasta. You can't go wrong with any of them.

Give this cute little place a chance, it's right at the left side before entering nyang nyang beach from main street or on your way to uluwatu temple.","The warung is very nice, a relaxing place!
The staff is amazing and the food is delicious!
We‚Äôve been there this past week a lot of times, three times for breakfast and fourth times for dinner!

There‚Äôs no hot water (idk why they advertise it), the AC was broken so it beeped all night turning off and on and then shutting off completely, and also there was blood all over my mosquito net which was repulsive. When I told the receptionist he absolutely did not care, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs used to negative comments and choses to ignore them instead. Really don‚Äôt recommend","If it was possible to rate 0 star it would be that way. First the receptionist was everything but friendly, no smile policy, and you cant pay by card, only cash, in opposition to what you can read on the booking. Then you go to the room, on the way it's dirty, even the pool, the moskito net is dirty and the room doesnt have a window. During the night at 3 am, the clim started to ring for hours, not just ours but we could hear the same in other rooms. The same for the wifi that stopped and never came back during the night. The icing on the cake are the ants, what a beautifull surprise to wake up after an amazing night with ants everywhere in the room, and so, everywhere in your bags. Run away","One star is generous for this place. Nowhere near anything good and the rooms do not make up for it. When I arrived, the receptionist was INCREDIBLY rude and condescending, and his wife scowled at me the whole time. When I was shown the room it was a small, unwelcoming cube. There were signs of bedbugs on the bed as well.

I chose not to stay here in the end. Not a vibe fam","The pictures are very deceiving.  This place looked like a dump upon arrival, there were piles of garbage stacked up on the property. The hosts were rude and unfriendly.  I thought it was odd there was no window in my bedroom and I did not feel safe there.  The sheets and towels looked dirty.  I trust my gut and I left after 1 hour.  There are a ton of places to stay better than this.  The location is great but it's not worth it.","HIGHLY RECOMMENDED‚ú®Ô∏è
The owners are amazing people who go over the moon and beyond for their customers. We arrived late which was not a problem for them, after traveling over 25hours we were more than happy to get a shower with hot&cold water, clean sheets and warm welcome. Location is great as it's close to the temple and there are couple small grocery shops and nice restaurants in walking distance. They also have small shop in the premises in case you need a snack. The staff helped us to buy tickets for the fire dance show and they even took us there because we were bit in a hurry to see the temple before the show. All our questions were answered and the premises are nice with many plants and a pool. Thank you very much for everything Batu Kandik Homestayüôèüèªüòä"

It has aesthetic wooden interior design, and the view of the beach is wonderful. The waitresses that served us were all very friendly. However, the restaurant didn't have a lot of ingredients, and our first 3 choices of order were all rejected as they didn't have it. Even a drink! That was quite a pity. And their Salmon, as well as Fish & Chips tasted,, pretty average

Their Pink Lady cocktail could be improved as well - use a more fresh egg white, add more Gin & grenadine syrup (yes, I was a bartender in the past)

Regardless, I still recommend visiting this restaurant if you're visiting Nyang Nyang Beach, for the views!","Met the owner of the restaurant at the gym and asked what he recommended. He said the ribs, so i tried them. Really really good, will come at least once a week since it is a good option to nasi goreng or grilled fish (which is also really good). Friendly staff & nice view included.

And if u order rice instead of the fries it‚Äòs even healthy.","Really enjoyed this place we came for lunch and had the best steak I‚Äôve ever had, they have amazing cocktails everything is really well priced The staff are absolutely lovely and helpful. We really enjoyed our time and look forward to coming again. would definitely recommend others",Hidden gem that is well worth the visit. This place is amazing with cheap food and drinks (50000 rupia long Island ice tea) and all prices include tax and service so no hidden surprises when you go to pay. The food was good and loved the desert (I had the banana split). This is really worth checking out as the beach is accessible below at the bottom of the cliff via motorbike. If you do want to relax and have a few nice cheap drinks recommend getting a driver or gojek as it is a fair way from the mainsteam areas (about 10 to 15 minutes ride),"We should have known better ordering pizza, but we at least expected fresh pizza not frozen pizza heated up. One of our pizzas had plastic in it. Also the pizza was very sweet tasting.

If you order traditional Bali food then you are probably fine!

Service was nice."

The complex consists of 3 bungalows with a balcony and a lovely bed, TV with even Netflix, coffee/tea making facilities and a private bathroom. Swimming pool in front of the door where you can relax for an afternoon.

Nyang Nyang beach is about a fifteen-minute walk away and you can easily reach the center of Uluwatu by scooter or taxi. They don't offer breakfast, but it doesn't matter at all because there is a nice restaurant about a 5-minute walk away where you can have a good breakfast.

Geday the host is incredibly helpful, during our stay he did everything he could to make it as pleasant as possible. He even drove to Uluwatu temple to get us a ticket for the Kecak dance! (this was sold out online for 2 days, but luckily Geday had his connections).

The rooms are clean! I must mention that there are occasionally a few insects in the bathroom, Geday gave us a spray to eradicate them when they appeared. We found this no problem at all.

Unfortunately they are building on both sides of the complex, which is a shame because it is such a beautiful and green spot.

We had a great stay and will definitely come back when we go to Bali again!","We were greatly disappointed with our experience upon arriving at Sanjula in Uluwatu, as we quickly discovered concerning issues. The most prominent among them was the ongoing construction work that extended alongside the entire right wall of the villa. This fact was not communicated to us prior to our arrival, and we were informed that the construction activities were scheduled daily from 8 am to 7 pm. The villa's walls being insufficiently high allowed us to witness the construction taking place, and it also meant that the workers could easily see us while swimming or sunbathing, compromising our privacy and relaxation.

Furthermore, we were surprised to find that the actual size of the villa was notably smaller compared to what we had envisioned from the images.

Due to these unwelcome discoveries and the lack of prior communication about the construction, we ultimately decided not to stay at this accommodation. As such, we cannot provide a complete review of the entire stay, but we believe it's important to highlight these concerns to potential guests. It's crucial that the management ensures clear communication with future visitors and provides accurate representations of the property to avoid such disappointments. Based on our experience and the issues encountered, we would caution others to carefully consider these aspects before booking at Sanjula.","The property looked better on the pictures than in reality. It kinda ruined our stay in Uluwatu. It is not well maintained and not clean at all. The sheets were stained and there is a lot of mold in the bathroom. There where a lot of gaps which made it easy for bugs, insects and other animals to come in. We were horrified to find a lot of centipedes and ants in our room. They were crawling everywhere. We were also surprised with lizzard poop on our bed multiple times. The staff did not speak English which made it hard to communicate.

It is important to know that there were constructions on both sides, which we were fine with. But the insects and lack of cleanliness made our stay awful.

This accomodation has so much potential but at this point I would‚Äônt recommend it to anyone.","The place looked extremely nice. Very spacious room and a nice outdoor kitchen.  The bathroom was very decent as well, the shower worked and they provided you with good towels, both for pool and bathroom use. The staff was extremely helpful with everything and didn‚Äôt mind driving you down to the beach so you would know your way around. Good wifi & tv and the food you could order tasted good as well!

The big down side was that when it was raining properly, a lot of water would come into the room through the sliding doors. This happened in the middle of the night and during the day. Because of this I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all at night and decided to check out early. Especially since it‚Äôs not the cheapest place to stay. They did try to fix it but sadly it didn‚Äôt work. So I would recommend this place when it‚Äôs not rain season!","Very nice, small and quiet. The beach is just 3 minutes by scooter. We had a very good stay at this place. It has no restaurant but his own kitchen to use by yourself. Free bali coffee, tea and water. Everything in the kitchen was clean.  It is good to rent a scooter to explore the really nice area. Our room was big and the bathroom was very nice and clean as well. The stuff were very friendly and
courteous. We were even invited to the birthday party of the owner. It felt like you being part of the family.
One thing to say. The neighbor property is currently under construction. so you hear some construction noise. But since we were exploring during the day, we hardly noticed anything.
Great stay I would come back!"

Only downside is the location is a 15-20min moped ride from most of the Uluwatu restaurants, shops etc. so you really want a moped in this location.","A delightful group of wooden villas, with a superb swimming pool in a lovely garden. As 2 oldies, without a car or motorbike, we need taxis to go to the beach and the shrine, but that is our problem. All the other guests have motorbikes. A lovely, peaceful atmosphere, highly recommended.",Amazing place to stay in Uluwatu. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The room is really nice and the pool and garden are perfect. Would stay here without hesitation if I come back to Uluwatu.,"The Wooden Villas are just as beautiful as shown in the listing photos. The location of the property is a short scooter ride away from any Ulu activity.

The host Putu and her grounds staff were incredibly sweet and attentive to our every need.

As mentioned by other reviewers, I highly recommend using earplugs at night. The area is in nature and is indeed full of the sounds of nature. Throughout that first night we were kept up by sounds of dogs, roosters, monkeys etc. Thankfully the staff provided earplugs in the common space for us to take advantage of and the rest of the nights were perfect sleep.

We highly recommend booking one of these lovely cabins, just be prepared with some sort of noise canceling device!"
