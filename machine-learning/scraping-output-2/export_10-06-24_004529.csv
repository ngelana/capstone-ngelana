The place is clean, price is cheap and thw waitress is also very nice. As it taste good, most of the food are sold before 1pm üòÆüòÆüòÆ. A place where locals eat, you must try tipat cantok (gado2 balinese style) rujak kuah pindang (spicy fruit salad) and of couse their roasted betutu. Yum!!","Tasty! Bumbu kecombrangnya bikin ga eneg. Price was cheap, portion was quite big. We didn't try the other menu because we were already full. Definitely will be back.","This place is better for takeaways. There's not much space to sit on the first floor. The second floor has an air conditioned space but it's pretty dark and dingy. The balcony has 1 table.

But overall, the food is tasty, on the spicy side but not too spicy. It's a great place if you want to try the local dish, ayam betutu.",Never thought Betutu Panggang will be soooo good. Love the smokiness!

The coffee here is lacking in flavor compared to other coffee shops nearby that offer a more satisfying taste for the same price. In fact, the pricing seems a bit steep for the quality of coffee you get.

I decided to try their signature Camani coffee, but it tasted just like the generic iced coffee you can find at a convenience store.

Furthermore, the entire seating area is outdoors, which can be quite uncomfortable on hot afternoons. I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work or spend extended periods.

The service here leaves much to be desired and could certainly be improved.","Good place and cozy place,good food and drink",Worth It,Top,Nice coffee
