When your kids are fussy eaters like mine, this is a good place for the adults to enjoy local food and the kids to enjoy their usual food","Warung Bamboo is definitely a tourist trap. As a local living in Bali, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. The food is overpriced with very small portions that don't justify the cost. The taste is mediocre at best. This will be the first and last time I visit this restaurant. There are far better and more reasonably priced options available elsewhere.

It was fun to see him fighting to get the meat inside.
I took the creamy chicken pasta, and the flavours were amazing.
The restaurant is in front of a rice field, it's so peaceful to eat while watching it.
The staff is very welcoming and kind.
Don't miss this place in Canggu, you'll not regret it !!","Overall, the atmosphere was lovely, the food was delicious, we ordered Mad Red Crab and Chilli Crab with level 2 spicy, it was a lil spicier than what we can handle, and we also have it with 500 grams crab, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the smaller crab as its not very much meat inside. We have the fried mantou but it was overcooked and there are a lot of mosquitos in the area but they did provide us with the mosquito spray ;)","I only went here to try and eat crab for the first time. For one time experience, this was great but I don‚Äôt see myself eating crab very often. The food is very tasty, the staff is very helpful and the atmosphere is beautiful.

The crab meat is very tasty. But in order to find the meat you need to ‚Äúfight‚Äù with the crab and break the shell. This can take time for inexperienced ones. It took me one almost one hour to break the crab and finish the meat.

I recommend order something else together with the crab. A soup for example. Everything tastes good here.

For those curious, the crab meat tastes like shrimps, maybe a bit more sweet than shrimps.

Enjoy the experience! üôÇ",Really delicious crab! I loved the Indonesian red and my husband really liked the Singapore Chili crab. It is better than some of the crab we had in Singapore ! Fried buns were a highlight too. Staff were really friendly and the view was great. Unfortunately forgot to take photos of the crab because it looked so good and we dug right in,"Wow! Just woooooow! I came here alone because I was craving for ü¶Ä and I live in the neighborhood, I always see this place and wanted to try.. the crab was super fresh, the sauce is amazing, it‚Äôs sweet & spicy!! I regret I ordered only 1! I definitely coming back!!! Great job!!!! Thank youuuu"

Good chili, good portion of rice, meat that is not too dry, good meat floss, good keropok, only thing is the thick crispy skin can be less fatty for more crisp. Oh the soup is so good and have some small portion of meat on it which was delicious.

That bike ride here, worth it and will do again","Delicious :) reasonably priced, served with red rice, & beef soup. More of a local restaurant than for foreigners. But I like it that way :) The Babi guling is simple, no frills with pieces of crunchy thick rind, spicy side dishes and of course the delicious crispy Babi guling. The soup has a real kick to it.
