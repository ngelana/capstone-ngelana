The rooms are clean and spacious. The view is breathtaking.
Highly highly suggested if you want to visit Lovina ü´∂üèª",Amazing Villa to stay. Great and friendly stuff that even offers delicious vegan breakfast. üòç,BEUTIFULL!! Make sure u book more than 2 days is a must!,"This private villa really peaceful. Spend time here with my friends and the view just amazing. Morning time even more better. I can hear the chirp of birds and all nature voice.
If you looking for escape from hustle city then this place is good choice.
I suggest you to stop by the town and do shopping and Bring all your food stock before check in. Once you check in at this villa, then you have no desire to go out. So food stock will help you üòÅ.
The staff also very friendly.
Beach located only 10 minutes by scooter.
This place just wonderful.","Had a lovely stay here, the people are very friendly and the room is clean and comfortable üôèüèª"

I have been to this dream location twice now and each time I was amazed by the endless hospitality of the owners and the majestic sunset. We were served free fruit, and when my brother had a scooter accident, the owner took him to the hospital and spent two hours there, taking care of everything. I can highly recommend this accommodation to everyone. Everything is clean and the outdoor area is beautifully maintained.","Great quiet place, stunning view! Best place to be if you are in lovina beach. Even if you don‚Äôt drive a scooter the host will help you to get around :) you can order food by a great Restaurant or you can cook by yourself in the shared kitchen with goods you can buy from the local market.","Really nice and quiet place surrounded by great nature.
Awesome view on the sea.
The rooms are very clean and the staff is extremely friendly.
They even organized a dolphin trip for us with a great tour guide.","Me and my boyfriend had great time staying in here yesterday while in Lovina,very quiet in a night time amzing hills view so-rounding jungle view and you can see the sea view from up here,families friendly for staying in here and their staff is Lovely and friendly, in case you want to see dolphins they can arrange that for you or if you want to know others adventure activities just ask them, also not far away from Lovina beach took us maybe like 7 minutes to go there also close to pepito ""supermarket"" and vietamese food ""mevui"" definitely worth trying for everyone's want to go see dolphins and spend the night.üìåüìù‚ù§Ô∏èüòä",Excellent place to stay.
