Magical even!
Not easy to reach but worth the trip!
Enjoy a beautiful view from the mountains in a lushy green property, surrounded by trees & flowers. You have numerous relaxing spots to read, meditate, do yoga, stargaze, nap, or else.
The service is amazing and the whole staff is going over the top to make you feel at home and enjoy your stay.
The food is really good too and served quickly.
I wish I could have stayed longer!","Bali Mountain Retreat is a beautiful place to stay. The staff go above and beyond to help make your time here truely amazing. The Balinese culture is one I wished others experience as they are kind and thoughtful. Massages here are fabulous and relaxing. Thank you for the exquisite food and care Bali Mountain Retreat staff üôèüèΩ such a beautiful part of the world, a slice of paradise üå∏",Felt so at peace during my time at the Bali Mountain Retreat. The surroundings are beautiful. Loved sitting on my balcony and watching the sunrise. The staff took wonderful care of me and the food was more than satisfactory. Enjoyed a lovely massage and a guided walk to the rice fields. Wouldn't hesitate in coming back.,"We spent a full week here with my two toddlers after getting serious bali belly in Canggu. The staff were excellent and they offered on site babysitting for my kiddos. I found that after a few days the activity list was a little lacking, theres not much to do in the surrounding area. But if you want a relax and do nothing for a few days i highly recommend. The garden, clean air, and clean water make this a beautiful spot to slow down and take in the mountain air.","This place is disgusting, I don‚Äôt know what the other reviewers are talking about. On the first night I found a wasp in my bathroom and the hotel staff kindly swatted it. At dinner our table was covered in ants and the power went off at the restaurant 5 times and 2 times in our room. The rooms are okay but smell musty and mildewy and the bathrooms are gross. Also, animals stir during the night and roosters nearby crow at 5am and I found it really hard to sleep. However, the outside of the retreat is beautiful and the food is good. This place needs to get their act together, otherwise I really don‚Äôt recommend staying here!!!!"

Very quiet up in the mountains. The staff were fantastic. Some excellent local restaurants within 10 - 15 minutes walk. The staff are more than happy to drop you by moped. Local guide to bring you on jungle trek was also great.,"If you are looking for a place which has stunning views and is peaceful and quiet, then this is your place! We had the best stay! The host Komang was very accommodating and went out of his way to make sure everything was ok. He even went to the shops to get things we ran out of. Being a bit remote from everything Komang dropped us off at the local restaurants or picked up takeaway. He even offered to be our driver for the next few days taking us around to all these amazing tourist attractions. Komang spoke very good english and told us a lot of history about his culture and the places we were visiting. Normally you need to book him in advance if you want him as your driver, so we were lucky he was available.  His rates were very reasonable and he even dropped us off at the airport. The views and nature around the accommodation was breathtaking and very peaceful! Breakfast every morning was very delicious and was brought to our cabin where we had stunning views of the rainforest. Thankfully, not the season of bugs so we had our windows open all night listening to all the different sounds from the forest. Being out most of the day the evenings were a bit cool for swimming so we didn‚Äôt really swim, but the pool looked very inviting. We loved our stay and hope to be back again in the future.

We can‚Äôt complain about anything! Any issues we had we discussed it with the host and he tried to accommodate us. Told us that knowing what the issues were he could improve for next time.","Staying at Umah Legenda is a wonderful experience anyone who loves nature should live. I spent some nights there and I absolutely loved it. Adi, who's in charge of housekeeping takes a great care of guests. He did everything he could to help me rent a motorbike and he also prepared delicious breakfasts for me every morning. So friendly and smiling all the time!
The only thing people should be aware of is that it's far if you want to rent a motorbike and the nearest village is about 30 minutes by motorbike. Other than this, everything is great!
Would love to go back.","It‚Äôs all great , tower is special experience for sure , view is great for photos videos , stuff is very helpful Adi brought us whatever we asked for .. put 4 starts only because there no aircon, but at nights it‚Äôs cooler anyway, so all great ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç","Wanted to do some hiking in Bali so booked this hotel for a couple of nights as it is right near a hike I wanted to do. Location of the hotel is fantastic, you wake up to the sound of the jungle every morning and the views are stunning. The staff there are also amazing, they will do whatever they can to make your stay as pleasant as possible. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to get off the beaten track a little and recharge"
