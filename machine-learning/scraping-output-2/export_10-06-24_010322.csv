Will visit again this year,insya Allah","Great value for the money, friendly staff, clean rooms and overall the atmosphere was really chill. I liked the area as well.",I loved this place so much that I came back ! And then I even had a better room. Bright big windows with nature view. Such good vibe with loads people actually living there longterm. Hope to come back!!!,"It is a really friendly place! Really good standard. I stayed in the ‚ÄúJungle Suite‚Äù room. If you like the atmosphere of co-living it is perfect place for you. We have spent 3 months there and have had no problems. We had a really beautiful room. Nice kitchen that we were able to share and cook with other people. Additionally there was a nice TV in the room and beautiful jungle views. Actually the staff make it really good that all the people have contact with each other. It‚Äôs cool to meet and hang out with people from around the world and a normal hotel doesn‚Äôt promote that! Highly recommend The Paica! There is a nice atmosphere of relaxing, community and fun :)","We stayed in room D on the 2nd floor and that room is quite huge for 2 persons. Love the strong shower and jet shower was broken but the staff fixed it within a few hours. Unfortunately that room has no window so we need to open the door quite often for air circulation. Love to cook in their kitchen! House mates are very friendly feels like long time friends. Owner (bli Kadek) is very kind, we were allowed to stay 1 more day for free!"

You can taste the smokiness and roasted flavor in every bite of the chicken, which is tenderly cooked. It might be a bit too salty for some people, but eating it with rice balances it out.
