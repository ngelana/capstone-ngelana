It is an absolute must-see if you find yourself in Bali. We had an incredible time exploring every corner of it. If you happen to be traveling with elderly individuals, I highly recommend getting tickets for the electric buggy. The statue is located quite a distance away, and it would be more convenient for them to ride instead of walking the entire way.","What a beautiful place! This is a must visit when in Bali! We thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it. If you are travelling with senior citizens, then I suggest you take tickets for the electric buggy as you will have to walk quite a good distance to reach the statue.","The statues are very nice and it is best to go there in the morning, there are not so many tourists yet otherwise in the afternoon it starts to fill up. I recommend to arrive between 9 and 10 in the morning, you will enjoy very beautiful and unspoilt views.","It's a tourist experience, nothing more... If you go in with this attitude and not looking for a life changing cultural experience you'll enjoy walking around snapping pics. Wait for a cloudy day and buy your tickets online beforehand.","The new (only online) ticket purchasing system is a nightmare and takes at least 15 minutes (in a really hot weather) to go through. We purchesed the ultimate (all-in) tickets but we were  not able to go up to the statue despite a valid expensive ticket for that. We had to wait hours to get a next available slot which wasn't mentioned at the purchase.  The exhibition in the groundfloor is very scary and strictly not recommended for kids as it looks like a horror movie. The buggy driver are cheating with the buggy transfer so not recommended. It is just 5 minutes walk, do not pay for these criminals."

Beds are super clean and confortables. The breckfast is amazing and mom and dad are really kind and lovely persons, they are always there to help you.","Lovely place.
I like everything about it, the breakfast with coffee is really nice, everyone is nice and happy to be here.
The dorms are great, AC works place, locker rooms for your stuff.
Would love to stay again !","Lovely family owning the place. It really is great value for money especially with respect to the private rooms.

The room, bed and sheets were very clean. The room itself is basic and a little dated but as long as you don't expect luxury they are more than fine. The shared bathroom on my floor was a bit dated as well but still very clean, soap is provided and you don't end up sharing it with that many people. Also the rooms have AC which was working very well.

Some reviews are complaining about the hostel not being very social but that was not my experience at all. The garden is a great place to relax with a lot of nature and it's actually generally really quiet.

The complementary breakfast is also very good, especially the banana pancakes.

Recommended to rent a scooter considering that it is about a 20 minute scooter drive from most surf breaks.

Last but not least the wifi connection is extremely good. Probably the best I have had during my month in Indonesia.","Stayed in dorms and single room for 1 night each. Both were great.

The hostel is easy to find. Very relaxing space. Good for solo travelers to meet fellow travelers",Would 100% recommend. Stayed here twice (2 weeks total) during my stay in Bali. Love momma and poppa's breakfast. Nice clean beds with AC in the room and warm showers. Met many amazing people that have been staying long term at the hostel and I will definitely come back and do the same. Perfect warm and family like atmosphere.

Staff was SO friendly. Really enjoyed them. They got everything we needed and stayed on top of everything.

Pizza was very delicious. I recommend the fruit salad. It's fresh, tasty, and great for breakfast.

I ate a sort of Alfredo dish... which I'm sure was unclean because I felt horribly after eating it. I've had food poisoning for 2 days now (diarrhea, stomach and intestinal pain, nausea, slight fever).

My companions all had other dishes - tuna salads and pizza. They were completely fine. & the food was delicious. I don't know what made the difference with my dish, but I'd definitely avoid their pastas in the future.","Enjoyed a comfortable stay in their Family Room. Place is exactly as good as it looks, with super nice bathrooms, albeit the location is quite far from the main roads.

The staff is friendly and the food options were good. We also took their airport pickup which was smooth. Enjoyed our stay here.","Best in uluwatu, the rooms are so neat and comfortable, pool is very good and well maintained and restaurant food offers good food for decent price. Highly recommended","We had our best time here. One of the best stays I have been in Bali so far. Great rooms. Clean and spacious. The staff is just lovely. All are super friendly and nice.
We stayed here 30 days and enjoyed every minute of it.
We‚Äòll be back for sure.
Thank you for the great hospitality","Nice food, very friendly staff. We got the starter after the main course but they are so friendly that we didn't really mind. You get loads of flat bread with your food and it's delicious and freshly baked.

Take a Grab taxi, don't walk here alone at night. There aren't many restaurants around so we thought this a good choice of you want to eat close by. It's Western/ Italian though and no locals to be seen. If you don't mind, it's a good choice!

We only ate here, didn't stay in the hotel."

We absolutely LOVED this place. Not only are the rooms lovely, well equipped and spotless, but the service is out of this world. Nyoman is a fantastic hostess, a pleasure to talk to, nothing was too much trouble, all food was hand made and delicious, she even made us a take away breakfast when we had to leave early on our last day to catch a boat!! Nothing but exceptional.

Absolutely superb, I cannot recommend Nyoman or Pinokkios enough, you really feel like part of the family. Not only will we be back, we have been recommending this place to everyone üòç","Home sweet home. Nyoman&Tony and especially their doggo India make us feel happy and smile :) The room condition was perfect,clean,beautiful! I recommend here for making good memories in Bali.","Nyoman made us feel like home from the very beginning. She is the owner, speaks fluent English, Italian and Indonesian (among others I believe) and was even too kind to cook dinner for us a couple of nights (the surrounds are a bit limited and you need a scooter to go have dinner, but she gives an excellent alternative after a long day of excursions). The pool is super nice, normally quiet. The rooms are comfortable and clean with enough hot water (you have to wait a bit between showers, but it‚Äôs fine). She has an adorable dog (even if I am not a dog friend, he was quiet) and some cats.","I solo travelled to this place, and was feeling very sick. The owners of Pinokkio B&B were extremely helpful and kind. Without me asking they had provided me with fruits, medicines, and even helped me make calls abroad with their telephones. I have honestly never experienced such good hospitality. The place felt like home, with the way I was taken care of. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. The rooms are very nice, the area is pretty and the people are great. Plus great breakfast. I hope to come back in the future","Please do not hesitate to book your stay here! The property and rooms are immaculately clean, authentic, and all made from recycled and sustainable materials. Nyoman and her team are warm, welcoming and make you feel at home. Breakfast was simply outstanding - made from local, organic, in season ingredients.
I love the location of the property, being away from the overcrowded hotels and busy streets, there is a lovely village vibe which makes your stay an authentic Balinese experience.
Thank you to Nyoman for being an open, caring and beautiful person - I won't forget my stay here!"

- there were a lot of ants everywhere. We couldn‚Äôt sleep because they were biting us.
- living room was terrible with its sofa, also very dirty
- the bedsheets were terrible: stinky and dirty, with yellow stains
- also, photos in the internet are photoshopped, the reality is totally different.

The only positive thing is the location.

The security guys were nice, but this place needs a total renovation.","Very old, small and dirty huts. Stinks of mould. Bed linen from the Dutch expansion.
