Ideal for people traveling on their own. There is free food every night in one of the two dorms and it's always a good social get-together. So it's very easy to meet new friends. The hostel is very clean and the people who work there are ABSOLUTELY lovely. Highly recommend this place.,"I stayed at Eden Estate Ubud Bali for five nights. I liked the atmosphere and the room was cleaned every day. The staff are wonderful and friendly. I enjoyed my entire stay and will book again when I return to Bali. While I was there, I met great friends. Great for a solo traveler or if you are traveling with a group of friends!","Highly recommend! We had a wonderful stay here, it surpassed our expectations. It’s a really huge villa with 3 swimming pools and a cafe style restaurant. It was really quiet when we went which was nice, but got busier towards the end of our stay. It’s quite an alfresco stay, there’s an open air section in the bathroom so bugs do come in at night etc. you sleep under a net though so it’s not a problem. We has the choice of two rooms as there were some ants, which is fully expected when in Asia, and those as no problem at all. The staff are lovely and helpful and the breakfasts were great. There’s a lovely big sunbathing area with swing beds too. The whole vibe is very relaxing and peaceful. Taxis sometimes find it hard to access as it’s up and down some hills so always give yourself time before you need to be anywhere. It’s about 20 minutes from ubud centre which is the perfect amount to escape the tourist crowds. The rooms also don’t provide water or toothbrushes to reduce their plastic use, so be mindful to bring your own. A lovely stay overall and would highly recommend. Very zen!",This place has 2 normal and 1 massive pool. Brilliant atmosphere and very relaxing ambience. The staff is very sweet and very helpful. The food there is great and the rooms are simply amazing. A definite go for people looking to just relax and unwind.,"Room is big and beautiful ! But There was no mineral water, no hair dryer, No lifting pole for clothes, sofa and bed dust , it was not very clean, even I found a used razor on the bathtub. The blinds in the room are open and can't be closed. This means that you can hear, smell and feel the nature outside, but it is very cold to sleep at night. I also smell the cow dung, smell, I wonder if the design of this room is suitable for this season？"

The pork was pretty good and the prices were very reasonable. Got the pork meat and Balinese sausage with egg and vegetables and all of it was decent.,"One of my favorite Nasi Babi Guling restaurants in Gianyar. Their portion feels just enough and right that comes with an affordable price. The sambal is not that spicy, so I think foreigners will be just fine eating it, while Indonesians may find it not spicy at all. They have a spacious dining area, both indoor and outdoor. Sip on their whole young coconut or loloh cemcem after meals and feel refreshed after.","The location in the rice paddies is fabulous, even better than Pande Egi to be honest. Their Babi Guiing dish is great, not fantastic but I’d have it again regularly for sure. However their Ayam Geprek, grilled chicken, is amazing! I always order two pieces of chicken and one rice. It’s a great meal, really affordable in a spectacular ambience in the sunset on the terrace. Fantastic place I go to often. Service is hit and miss. But yeah, I love that place. Very local, very Bali. Beautiful.","really great view of rice paddies.
food is also really delicious, especially the steamed (?) pork. but pork skin is too tough.
and all for a great price, 35k for complete set, and fulfilling portion also.
overall worth to try if in ubud area",I really enjoyed it here. Our driver told us he was happy with our choice when we mentioned we wanted to try local foods outside the city center. The spices are STRONG from what I am used to so be careful. The staff there are incredibly sweet and warn you as well. I would recommend coming here if you want to try something a bit more local.

The serenity of the location, the stunning and unique architecture of the villas. The place is surrounded by lush jungle. There is a private river 2min walking from the villa, with a deck to sit on and feel like you’re a world away from everything else.

But most of all - the owner, Anima, and the whole DC staff are wonderful. They were communicative, kind, attentive - and took such good care of us and the villas throughout our stay. Breakfast was also superb.

Definitely one of the best places I’ve stayed anywhere in the world.","WOW! It was truly a dream come true! Everyone at the villa took care of my group as if we were royalty! They made us the yummiest, most nourishing meals and took care of the set up and clean up! They cleaned our rooms daily and gave us everything we could need! They helped set up all our yoga classes, fires, ceremonies, etc. They had amazing services and a lovely team of massage specialists that were sooo accommodating! They helped us with anything we needed and I can’t express how much gratitude I have for all of them! From the bottom of my heart, thank you! Your property and team are magical and I will 100% be back:)","Dwa Chandra transcends the typical villa experience, distinguished by its elegant amenities and a profound commitment to cultural and community values. The essence of its mission is palpable in every aspect of its operations. With a dedicated team who not only excel in service but also embody the ethos of local stewardship, they ensure a stay that's both enriching and heartwarming. The villa's serene and potent atmosphere is a tribute to the preservation of the local and sacred lands it surrounds, fostering a deep connection to the locale. A standout feature of Dwa Chandra is the exclusive access to the mystical river and caves below, offering a unique window into the rich history of the area. This space is more than just another villa; it's a sanctuary where relaxation intertwines with cultural immersion.

Dwa Chandra is more than a destination; it's an experience that resonates deeply with those who visit. It's perfectly poised to enhance any gathering, be it with family, friends, or for a retreat. The villa has left an indelible mark on my heart, and I am always excited to return to its refuge and creative centre.","Dwa Chandra is a visual and sensory feast! The stunning design of the rooms, combined with the soul-stirring proximity to the gorge and river, expands your sense of possibility.

But what truly elevates the experience is the thoughtful care and personal touch Anima and her team bring to everything.

Staying at Dwa Chandra was a proper vibe. Thank you, Team Dwa Chandra, for sharing your love!","It was my first time in Bali & it’s hard to know which places are genuinely as good as they appear online — so I asked a friend who has been in the hospitality sector in Bali for decades what his favorite spot is in Ubud. Without missing a beat he said, “Dwa Chandra.” It’s more than just a stunning villa with beautiful swimming pools and gathering spaces, more than the incredibly warm professional team who will welcome you and take incredible care of you from food to the best massages to transportation. 2 things make Dwa Chandra really stand out: 1) it has direct almost private access to the sacred river & caves it sits above which you will not find anywhere else in Ubud, 2) for thoughtful travelers who care about our impact on the communities where we travel, the Dwa Chandra model is intentionally designed in close relation to the surrounding community, providing jobs and career training, working hand-in-hand with local leaders to protect and steward sacred land together. Dwa Chandra is an amazing place to dream and recharge and learn about Bali, while knowing you are supporting the dreams of those around you. It is deeply, truly special. I am SO glad my friend recommended it. I want to bring my family here, friends here, and maybe host one of my team retreats here… love this place can’t wait to come back."

I didn't appreciate the lack of tax/service charge written on the menu, so it came to a very different price at check out. If I had known it'd be that price, I wouldn't have ordered/stayed. The staff took off the tax portion of the cheque after I said I don't feel comfortable paying what they were asking for because it wasn't indicated on the menu.

The staff was kind and lovely, however the service was slow.","Great place for coffee and food. We have eaten here 3 days in a row. Would recommend.
Similar to Melbourne coffee.","High quality of food and service, calm atmosphere and reasonable price. If you want a little rest from noodles and rice than definitely try Triple decker sandwich or hamburger. All traditional Balinese & western food is served in high quality by always smiling and nice waitress :) I also tried vegetable soup which was not spicy and nicely calmed my stomach…enjoy your food guys ❤️","The smoothies are quite good and very inexpensive. Also, my wife requested something off the menu, and the staff tried to accommodate her request without refusal, which is to be commended.

I would like to go here more often in the future, as it is a place I pass by every day.",A very good place to eat and dring in Pejeng Kawan. Food is very tasty with a mix of Balinese and Western food in the menu.

The problem is at night.  The living room is an open area, which brings flying insects in.  We dimmed the lights to prevent insects from coming in.  Also a lot of lizards and a couple of geckos come out at night.  If those things don't bother you, it is a lovely place to stay and we had a great experience there","Very nice homestay. All staff and host support was very appropriate. 4 days we stayed there , Mr. Gutsi was ready to us in any help at any time . Location is some interior side. Some insects were there, but it is in whole Bali.",Very good service. The rooms are very comfortable. The view from the main rooms and the pool is aligned westward. One can see the sun set along the beautiful scenery.,"Very very nice and spacious villa. Perfect for groups, quiet, good for party as well! The staff is very very friendly.

Would definitely recommend staying here!!
You won’t have any regrets :)","I stay one month at Bupala guesthouse it was definitely my best experience in Bali. I recommended it 100%.
Everything was perfect : the room is big and very clean and the hosts are awesome.
The place is really peaceful. Each morning a local balinese special food is served as a breakfast, very delicious 😋!

The family owner are lovely and definitely know what the word hospitality means.
They was so kind and always make special attention to me, I’m really grateful to find this place.
In the end I feel as a part of their family and it was so hard to say goodbye.

I’ll definitely come back in this place for my future trip in Bali.

Don’t worry if you bring your own car because he will help you maneuver the car. And he can help you plan and recommend what go do or where to go.
Love the traditional Balinese house and decorations (you can see their family temple and listen to some explanations). Good wifi, air con, and hot water. The rooms are spacious and clean, decorated with Balinese paintings and carvings. You can rent a whole floor consisting of bedrooms, bathrooms, living room and kitchen with personal porch. The breakfast taste nice. The property was built around paddy field and you can still see farmers harvest and plant their crops (I get to take an evening stroll and talked to them).
Overall, it’s very suitable for those interested in Balinese culture or group travelers.","Away from busy Ubud.
