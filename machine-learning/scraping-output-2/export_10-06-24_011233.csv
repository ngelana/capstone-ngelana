I rode motorbike from the airport and it took around 3 minutes to get to the hotel. The nearby street is not very busy and yet remains alive even in the evening which for me is a plus. You can find convenience stores nearby if you would need to relax and had coffee in the evening.

Upon checking in, I was given a welcome drink by the staff, and checking in didn't take long, around 10 to 15 minutes. The staff was friendly and care to explain to me all the facilities there.

The room is spacious, The best part I got the pool view. The only drawback is the room felt very dusty. I had severe allergy of dust, I can tell if a place is dusty. From the AC to the bed sheets. I had severe sneezing, runny nose, and teary eyes as I stay for 2 nights there. I even slept on the floor on the first night to avoid sleeping on the bed with that bed sheets on. On the second night, I decide to sleep on the bed with my mask on to avoid breathing in the dusts. Only then I realized when I open the window to let the fresh air in and make things better for me to get rid of the sneezing.
I think the management should take a good look of how the sheets are stored or handled, cause the sheet smells dusty like it's been stored for quite sometimes.
Also have the AC frequently cleaned to get rid of the dusts.","Always choose this hotel while visiting Bali, for business or holiday with family
Not a brand new hotel, but still have the great experience to stay here. But there's sometimes the lift can not close the door while we already entry the lift, maybe coz its just old one, but its okay with great and routine maintenance
The room is always comfy and great place near another culinary and hangout
The staff always give smile and greeting with great mood
Nice and tasty breakfast as always
Great and hope to go here again","I really live this place. Good atmosphere, near groceries, beach, bike rental, malls, and anything that most people do in Bali, even just for sightseeing, walking around hotels, specially at Kartika Rd.
The foods is good, nice service, i like the swimming pool.
Very recommended for staycation with families or friends.
I strongly recommend you a side pool room's","I do not recommend this hotel if you are looking for a quiet place to stay before or after your flight. Half of the hotel is being renovated.  Also, the area around the hotel feels unsafe at night plus there are hundreds of Indian restaurants. If we had known this, we would have gone to a different area.

We booked 2 'superior' rooms at this hotel and selected queen size beds in the booking. Upon checking in, they told me that 1 room would have two separate beds. After some discussion, we got what we wanted, and we got an upgrade to the deluxe room. When we finally arrived at the rooms, they were renovating the room next door. Loud banging and drillhamers.. We went back to the front desk, and they apologized and gave us a different deluxe room on the ground level. We accepted it because we were tired of complaining.

Upon seeing the room, it looked like an old hotel room from the 80s. Tiles and furniture were damaged, dirty linen on the beds and an old TV. The worst part was the noise from the suitcases rolling over the floor next to the pool 24/7.

On a positive note: breakfast buffet was great, a lot of options and very friendly staff. Also, the location is great. Close to the airport. We walked back in 10 min after dropping off our friends.","Didn’t rise above expectations. We walked from the airport using the pedestrian path and were there under 15 minutes. Staff were lovely. My kid LOVED the chocolate fondue. Room was big but VERY tired. When you pass reception, the hotel is very tired and old. The rooftop bar doesn’t exist - easy to get to if you’re into abandoned places though"

It is located next to the airport & that is its main advantage. Amazing property considering its location, facilities and cost of each night. Our Deluxe Suite was very comfortable. It was generously sized, well laid out, and absolutely spotless. The room - and the hotel's common areas - had clearly been given a good refurbishment and were well maintained.","I missed a flight and decided to stay close to the airport so I could catch another flight out as early as possible the next day. The staff here were very friendly, very happy to help and had great attention to detail. I only stayed 1 night so my experience was short but I found the room to be clean, comfortable and up to my expectation. The breakfast was adequate, like everywhere in Indo there are flies hovering at every morsel of food so fruit and salad was questionable but their range was decent. As it’s next to the airport I did hear planes landing and’s taking off but that’s to be expected. Overall a positive experience for a very short stay.","Amazing property considering its location, facilities and cost of each night. They improve the breakfast a bit for sure.
The rooms are purely resort type with a huge hall and bedroom next to it. It’s right at the sea side and the pool is quite big to plunge on a relaxed day.","Not what I was expecting. Decided to stay here the last night of our trip as it was close to the airport. Though the staff are friendly and the landscaping is nice, the rooms and food did not meet my expectations. The room is very plain and dated. I found the bed uncomfortably hard and the locked door between our room and another guests room was so thin that I could hear every word and every sound coming from next door.

The bathroom was very outdated and in need of repair. The bath tub enamel had peeled away and rusted on the inside, and there were ants on the floor, having entered from one of the cracks. The wifi router flashed a bright green light that lit up the room, and I was thankful to have brought an eye mask and earplugs.

We tried the food at both the Italian restaurant and the restaurant serving Indonesian food. Having spent the last week travelling across Bali and tasting true Indonesian food I can only describe the food at Patra as well-intentioned, Americanized and bland.

In conclusion, if you are looking for a budget hotel with close proximity to the airport this may be an option for you. It certainly is not a 5 star hotel by any means, but it will provide a roof over your head, friendly service and lovely pool access. The sunset view is nice also.","Pros :
* Restaurant wide options. 2 inhouse restaurants
* Their morning buffet is simply awesome with variety and great taste.
* location, you can access kuta beach from the property
* Beautiful pool
* You can watch flights take offs and landing as it near to the airport
* Big property, you need their battery car to reach your room and reception
Cons :
* Rooms are old and not so clean
* We encountered centipede in the bath tab which was a scary thing
* Insects in the room as it's surrounded by garden"

In fact the buildings are connected, making it easy to drop by the mall. The beach area is behind the hotel and the hotel's staff are very helpful. Our room was also very nice and spacious. The breakfast spread was delicious too. Highly recommended.","Stayed 4 nights for business trip in this hotel. Check in process was smooth, reception staff was helpful and the best thing about my room was the size. As someone who enjoy lots of space this is a plus: My room also had a terrace which is cool for enjoying my morning coffee.

The mall adjacent to the hotel is also a plus. Although the tenants are super basic, at least there are ATM machine and supermarket which is a big plus.

The only reason I gave 4 stars was because as a light sleeper I cant tolearate the noise from the hallway. I also could hear people talking from the room next door. The soundproof quality needs to be improved.

The restaurant is cozy and although the hotel is full, I didnt have to wait for too long to be seated. As a vegetarian, I wish they add more options and less oily fried food in the future.","Nice hotel, we liked everything! A particularly large and spacious room with a balcony. But I would like to improve the room service, because our flight was late and we arrived after the airport very tired and hungry after a 10 hour flight. And we really hoped for room service, but it did not work (
We were forced to go to the nearest store at 2:00 a.m. and eat snacks. Therefore, I want to improve this point.
Everything else was great! Especially the view on the rooftop is incredible.
The breakfasts are also delicious, but I wanted a little more European cuisine! Thank you for the great service!","This Hotel is a perfect holiday getaway - it’s a place to relax it’s location is perfect for a walk around all the shops the shopping mall and a night market are just around the corner.
The facility itself is really luxurios and the staff is amazingly friendly and speaks perfect English.
For a sunset you can just go up to the rooftop and sit by the pool.","This hotel is only 15 mins away from the airport, has a lot of food options nearby. Every single staffs were friendly and good at English. Ms. Debby handled my reservation and she was so fast to respond if I need anything. It has a gym, pretty pool with a nice sunset view, so far I’m loving the vibes. I am pleased and highly recommend this hotel. 👏🏻 I write more below about the details."

The breakfast staff were not only attentive but also genuinely caring, ensuring a delightful start to each day. The variety and quality of the breakfast spread were commendable, catering to both adults and children alike.

Speaking of children, the hotel environment is perfectly suited for families. With various amenities and activities tailored for kids, our little one had a blast throughout the stay.

Well maintained property and polite, helpful hospitality staff and reception staff, specially Ms Lita for making our stay memorable.
My kid loved spending time at Kid's club.
Value for money...👌💰",Perfect! I didn’t expect to have such a wonderful experience at the “hotel by the airport” that I was just staying at because I got in too late to travel to my next stop. Now I wish I could stay here long. The service is amazing. The room is clean and comfortable. The shower is bonkers cool. The breakfast was so good I had to stop myself from eating more. Highly recommend!,"Very surprised this is a 5 star property.
1. Check-in took me 45 minutes as the room was not ready, even after reaching at 3 PM.
2. Room (especially the floor) was dirty. Water pressure in the bathroom shower almost non existent.
3. Food is nowhere close to 5 star quality

Plus breakfast starts early at 6:30, so that gives you time to eat something before flying. Breakfast is buffet style, and has quite a variety and local Balinese food. The service is very friendly and helpful. The rooms were good and clean, although they did not include a complimentary bottle of water like most hotels, in fact it was quite expensive to buy it. I would recommend it for anyone who needs to be close to the airport","Stayed only a few hours to have shower and refresh for late flight. The overall impression was clean, quiet, friendly and convenient. Room and facilities were clean and reasonably quiet as we stayed during February, which is low season. Staff was helpful and friendly. We were going to miss the free breakfast next morning but they offered boxed lunchbox instead, which was very nice. We had enough time to have a nap, massage, swim and refreshed without hassle. - The shuttle was very convenient and was hourly as promised.","Decent option close to the airport. Has a free airport shuttle ever hour and a screen with flight info in the lobby. The rooms are ok, your experience will depend on the room. In 2 stays we had 1 poor room and 1 good room. If you get a good room where everything is clean and neat then you feel like you got a bargain. The staff are always friendly and helpful and the service is excellent. There is a decent restaurant with reasonable prices, and the pool is good as well.","Very nice hotel close to the airport. Shuttle leaves the hotel every hour on the hour and is included. We took a taxi from the airport for 150k. Set prices at the taxi stand. Slightly more than the distance would seem, but airport taxis are more.  The breakfast buffet was quite extensive with Cappuccino’s included! Well stocked at 8:30 am. All sorts of street shopping just outside the door. Large mall nearby."

However, I do think some improvements can be made. The entrance of the hotel is really grand and inviting, the pool is nice, but the rooms are not. The sheets have some stains but appeared clean. The bathroom does have mold, ants, and the towels smell like they've been inside a BBQ smoker/ashtray and I'm not sure where that is from. I'm not sure why they have balconies either as it opens up to other rooms and an ally way. That being said, the staff was very friendly and nice and check in and check out was easy. I only stayed for a night after a late flight into Bali. I would stay here again if just for airport transfer/1 night. I would not stay for multiple nights as other hotels in the area are not much more but offer more comfortable arrangements. If you need a no frills, affordable place to crash for a few hours before/after a flight I do recommend it. If you're staying in the area I do not recommend and think other hotels would be better suited for long term.","Looks like the establishment is trying really hard to get good record again. The staff was dead nice and helpful. Breakfast could have more meat or protein, but for Asian money, it's perfectly fine. Would come back again","Stay here for Nyepi (Silence Day in Bali) 2N3D. As also a hotelier not much expect but this is DISASTER.

1. The check in was delayed. The check in time start from 2pm, the room is not ready and have to wait until around 3.45pm till the room ready, the lobby very crowd and unmanageable. But I believed this issue also happened in another hotel, but the worst thing is they didn’t do apologize to the guest for this kind of issue. Many of the guest waiting at the lobby and unmanageable.

2. Requested for balcony room. Like the room until the storm happened. The heavy rain with strong with hit the balcony glass till craked. Very dangerous! The room was flooded with water entering from the rift of the balcony glass.

Asking for another room and the front desk mention there is no room. The one thing that they can only do is call the housekeeping and put many towel to cover the balcony rift and let the room flood as hell, till complaining to the MANAGING DIRECTOR and finally they find another room at least the safety room for us. Pls feel free to see the picture and the video.

3. THEY MONETIZE EVERYTHING! During Nyepi as we don’t need room cleaning (make up room) we only ask for refilling the amenities and they asking for the additional charge!! Not make sense ? We are not asking for make up room and we should deserve for the amenities. Asking for 2 glass of ice cube, they also charge you IDR 10k per glass. What the hell ?! Not even worth for 3 stars hotel and they can give you complimentary ice bucket. We know that you are running the business but only an glass of ice cube you are charging and is not part of service that we pay ?

4. The DINNER WAS DISASTER. Many of guest waiting for the food. We almost waiting 45minutes till the food coming.

Absolutely this is not worth for 4 stars hotel. Embarrased! They are selling 4stars but can’t meet 4stars standard, at least the standard they cannot meet.

Totally not recommended hotel.","Bathroom floor is slippery.
Breakfast not many choice and repeating for all three days I stayed.
Services still decent.
Room size is just small.","We will start off with the cons because there's so many and I need to get it off my chest.
1. There was no airport transfer come on you're 10 minutes from the airport surely you could be more supportive and help?
2. Pretty sure they were trying to scam me in the whole 22 years of me travelling I have never been charged with cleaning fees because of makeup or fake tan stains. I can admit there was tan on the towels and the bed but as a woman I know this comes out in the wash. They had randomly called the room and asked for 1 million rupiah cleaning fee. Thinking that this is absolutely ludicrous I went across the road and paid 100,000 rupiah in which the towels and bed sheets were returned to me in pristine condition. Had someone check the room and they said it was fine and we would not be charged. To my surprise what's holding me up from checking out is that they wanted to charge me a cleaning fee! Unfortunately I had to raise my voice because I had a flight to catch to Australia and I said you go across the road and you ask that guy I got it cleaned and reluctantly they let me go. This is absolutely disgusting considering how much the room is a night. Are they scammers?  Also you have to accept that if someone's staying in a room for four nights and you've not made a fresh bed she said they might be a little stain on it.
3. This hotel completely catfished me. On agoda It was stated that there would be an outdoor bar and cocktails by the pool. However when I got to the hotel I was told that there was no alcohol and definitely no cocktails because it is a Muslim hotel. Now I respect traditions but this is completely false advertising. Not sure if my rights in Indonesia, but hell if this was Australia I would be taking you to a small claims court. It really dampen the holiday because as an Australian you want to drink in the pool and that was not the case at this hotel.
4. Half the time the aircon was not on the gym both of the treadmills had broken screens and one was completely unusable It just stopped working after a few minutes which almost caused me injury.

For an Australian I would never recommend this scamming hotel.

The small amount of pros is that the breakfast was okay and it is in a great location in Kuta. Some staff were friendly.

It makes me sad to write this because I do like Bali and the Indonesian people but people need to be warned."

Overall Great resort, great staff.","Situated within 10 minutes from the airport this resort offers a great value stay at a great location.
Resort gives a old school vibes despite of modernity which I personally liked more .
The resort serves a good breakfast with different cuisine and with a variety of choices.
Staff consist of some good looking and understanding persons which are very attentive in case you faced any difficulty and despite of the area of resort working efficiently to maintain it properly.
There are many amenities within the resort like spa, gym, meeting rooms which are easily accessible within time period.
Moving towards the room, it's good but what I personally think they can do a little revamping.
Overall it was a good experience","Worst experience.

Low light and very old rooms.

I strongly advise to check the rooms at the time of check in and if possible, keep few photos of glasses and bedsheets if you find anything fishy.

We checked in the room and the window glass was already broken but had to pay the price of it. No staff was ready to listen to anything.

70% of their tourists are from INDIA and they look down at Indians like criminals. Manager is so adamant and arrogant to listen to anything we say. No extra towels, no extra water or no extra services.

This hotel ruined my entire experience of Bali. Bali prople seemed very nice and friendly but not this hotel. They are worst.

After my such experience, I tried to read the reviews and I came to know that these people have done the same before with many other guests also. Be careful.","The hotel is a gem in Kuta with everything top notch. Walkable to cafés and local shops, to the beach and eateries, this resort indeed is a place to stay.
The rooms are large and are arranged as cottages with long running natural passages with a large pool. The resort also has a good restaurant and breakfast options are too many. The bar offers happy hours and there is a multicasting restaurant too.
The best part is the service provided at the resort. Just go for it !!"

Wonderful pool and sunken bar, lovely restaurant. A mixture of old and new accommodation as they are updated. Breakfast included in some packages. Prices are reasonable and they have many return guests. We would certainly return.","NEVER AGAIN.  I rarely complain about hotels, but I have to say that you should definitely avoid this hotel.

I called this morning to make the booking for tonight. I explained that we were two adults, one 5 year old boy and a baby. I asked for the total price for us with a double bed and extra bed for our eldest son.

Check in is from 2pm and we arrived at 2:30pm. The same receptionist I spoke to was surprised to see us because she thought we weren’t coming! After a sweaty drive from Ubud, we had to wait to have our room prepared and were told we would be charged extra for the bed for our son. Not very professional.  When I tried to explain the miscommunication with the receptionist on the phone, I was met with disbelief and treated like a nuisance. There’s nothing shameful about accepting that a staff member made a mistake. I would have gladly accepted an apology and paid the extra cost. Instead I felt like the receptionist staff members were ganging up on me to make me pay extra.

The cherry on the cake? There is a rowdy wedding from 4pm in the garden and pool area. Think karaoke style music and disruptive drunken rowdiness. We were only informed about the wedding AFTER paying for the night. Wouldn’t that be relevant information to give beforehand if you are concerned about customer satisfaction?! Unbelievable!

Do yourself a favour and choose another hotel which doesn’t see guests as walking money. Clearly at Rama Beach it’s about maximum profit at all costs.","I couldn't recommend this resort highly enough. From the minute we arrived after 20 hours travelling, we were made to feel totally at home. The staff are fabulous, and to single one out would be unfair. Our pool with villa was perfect and cleaned daily. Food selection was plentiful to cover all varying tastes thanks to their new head chef, Eduardo. A special mention to all the barmen who kept us entertained each evening","We love the Rama Beach Resort hotel and have stayed here many times - won’t stay anywhere else! Location is great as it’s not right in the middle of the hustle and bustle but only a ten minute walk to the main areas. The staff are always so beautiful, the service is wonderful, the rooms are always lovely and clean and the best pool area.
Thank you Rama 🙏🏻 as always we will back!",Magnificent pool area. Very clean. Great staff. Food is awesome and location is great. Special thanks to frontline staff reception. Also special thanks to dini at reception for making things very comfortable. Highly recommend this place to everyone

It's in a great location, easily accessible by walking or Grab. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. I'd like to highlight the great service by, Mr Windu at check in, Ms Grace and her great tips of where to visit, and Mr Weda who drove me from the hotel to my next destination.

The rooms are comfortable and very clean. I only ate a bit at the restaurant, but I enjoyed everything I had.

I could never get hot water in my shower - I'm not sure if that was happening throughout the hotel or just my room. And I thought it was quite odd that at the pool area, you can see into the bathrooms from the elevator zone - meaning that you can see people inside the bathroom while they're using it. I think that is a poor design (and not very private).

Overall it was a good stay, and I'm sure many future guests will also have a good time here.","I had a great stay here. The staff were absolutely brilliant- every one I had any dealings with.

Originally, I had booked for 3 days, but after getting a leg injury and not being able to walk, I extended my stay by 3 days and the staff upped their already excellent levels of service to help me in any way they could.

I loved the roof terrace pool with plenty of room for both sunloungers and beanbags to sunbathe on.

My hotel room itself had a large, comfy bed, a decent sized table to work at, a fridge and a safe. The bathroom was a little cramped, but sufficient.

All the meals I had were good quality and value.","Excellent! Counter staff very kind and helpful and everyone always smiling all over the hotel. Very professional vibe overall. Rooms are modern and clean, breakfast buffet very big and good. Thanks!!","It’s a nice hotel and conveniently located close to the airport. The breakfast is okay and the lamb fried rice is delicious. The immediate surroundings have all the basics i.e 24hr shop, motorcycle rental, laundry service etc.","I would not recommend this property. We called and we were told they had plenty of rooms. When we arrived they told us that they only had their most expensive room available. It was 3am add we were exhausted. So we had no choice. The blinds in three bathroom were broken so we had to go outside so people could use the bathroom and shower. There were a few bugs in the room and tons of bugs in the lobby area. $87 for this in Bali wasn't worth it. We do not recommend it and will not be back.

Also the surrounding area isn't the best. Didn't feel safe. A loud prayer went off at 7am and we could hear people moving things above us and around us.

Didn't get a chance to try the TV. We slept and left."

We will always come and stay here","We were not able to make the trip and can only remark on the service we received. We informed the hotel of the cancellation in advance and were hopeful they would refund us for the one night stay; however, they unfortunately refused. We had booked two other hotels in Bali for the remainder of our trip, each of which was able to accommodate us with a refund. It was a clear lesson to us about the quality of different hotels and, in particular, their management teams. We will not be considering Sulis again when we come to Bali later this year.","I wasn't sure which hotel to pick and this one looked like it was close to the water.
What a great choice! The staff let me leave my bags locked away in a room because I arrived early. This gave you time to walk to the beach which was maybe 4 minutes if that. After wandering around that part of town, Then they got me into the room early.
Check out time is at noon. But  let me stay use the pool and a shower because my flight wasn't till 9:00 that night. They kept the luggage locked behind the office and I was able to come and go as I needed until it was time to leave.

Highly recommend this hotel. The staff of course makes it great,, but it is a very clean and modern place. Large tile everywhere,, walls and floors.. a rooftop pool is awesome along with The food service.","Hotel lobby to beach is a 90 second walk. Despite old looking lobby, the rooms are large, clean and modern (even USB charger and international power outlets). Same for the balcony. Location is next to Holiday Inn Express and Holiday Inn Resort. Walking distance to restaurants, convenient stores, money exchange, etc. Rooftop swimming pool is “good enough” and provides airplane take off/landing spotting.

Beds are comfy and there's curtains, lots of toilets and showers. Staff are so nice.

The food is cheap and decent portions compared to what you'll get if you walk 2 minutes to the main street. Top 3 of the best meals I've had in Indonesia. The breakfast is also nice and you pick from options, but it's only 8-10am so I could only enjoy it 1 morning since my other 2 mornings I had to leave for the airport at 5am.

Nice community area & good breakfast included. 15min walking distance to the airport and 24h check in.

But it's a very good price for what you get.","One the best hostels i have lived in. Talking about the staff, facilities, Room and Aura, everything was just perfect.

I was visiting Bali with my family and booked two rooms online only to find out that one room had a quilt and the other did not. The air conditioning in both rooms was rotten and was leaking all night, especially in my room, which was leaking all night with water all over the floor. The sound insulation is very poor, you can clearly hear the conversation in the next room. The bathroom doesn't have any toiletries except bath towels. There were black handprints on the sheets... The scariest thing was that when we came back to the hotel after going out for dinner, the door to our room was open... I will never come back to this hotel. It was horrible.",Honestly which I could give this place zero stars. Been staying in Bali for over a month now and needed a place for our last few days here. The worst hotel/resort out of all of them! On our second night there was a 50th wedding celebration which we were never informed off. The party was LITERALLY OUTSIDE OUR DOOR! Like I’m not being dramatic some of the party guests made themselves right at home using our chairs right outside our room. Had no respect for us as hotel guests that have actually paid to stay here! We told the front desk about the people sitting outside our room and they said that it will be over in 2 hours and said the best they can do is give us dinner for free the next night which in my opinion isn’t enough. When we wanted to go out for a smoke they kept giving us dirty stares and made it feel like we were the ones in the wrong which I can assure you Im a people pleaser but this was over the line! Don’t waste your money here! Im used to Bali being loud at night and im a young woman so I can put up with it and have in several different places we have stayed at but this was just completely out of order! Ended up moving the chairs from outside our room to inside to help resolve this problem that shouldn’t have occurred in the first place. Which I could give you zero stars. Do better ad think more about your hotel guests rather than party guests! Wish I could move hotels but can’t get a refund. Worst night of my life in Bali and I’ve had Bali belly twice staying here! The only good thing about this place is the cute cats,"Great location right behind Lippo Mall. Paths within the complex are very rough and dangerous. Stairs to upper floors are typical in Bali different tread heights and you need to keep a watch out for this, also tiled and slippery. Rooms adequate."

Stark Boutique Hotel and Spa was a great value for the money. It had ample parking space and a variety of restaurants nearby, including an Indian restaurant one across the street. The staff were very friendly and helpful. However, there were some problems that I encountered and reported to them, which seemed to be common among other guests as well but need to be solved by Management ASAP. These were:
- The air conditioning was not powerful enough to cool the room properly. The fan speed was too low and ineffective. Staff tried to clean them but as of my knowledge AC are old need a replacement.
- The toilet had a slow drainage issue that caused water to accumulate and smell bad. It took hours for the water to clear up.
These issues need to be solved by the management as soon as possible. Other than that, the hotel was convenient and comfortable.
Thanks","Here just for transit but it was really bad experience. Very old, low maintenance building. The room is very much dark, cracked walls, stained bed sheet, all the furniture look like it has been used for more than 20 years very old and dirty, the towel is the worst, the bathroom smells bad. I cant even bother to shower here.","Nice hotel, we were upgraded to the grand deluxe room and the staff were very accommodating.
Air con and wifi we're great, comfy firm bed and pillows.
Rooftop pool was always too busy to use.
The buffet brekky was ok, but it got a little boring after a few days.
The same old food, scrambled egg, rice, fried chicken or fish.
No bacon or sausage or even hash brown for westerners. Overall the location is good and the staff are pleasant."

At the low price point, I have little to complain about.

1. People at reception were cheerful.
2. Room Aircond was very good.
3. Room was larger than I expected.
4. Water pressure was good
5. Shower gel/shampoo was in a pump. They were NOT good.
6. They gave dental kit, shower cap. Unexpected at this price level.
7. Bedsheets were clean and white.
8. Bed was comfortable enough
9. That was a TV with I think at least 20 channels.
10. Lighting in room was more than adequate.
11. There was a room safe, but it was already locked.
12. They had sashes of tea and coffee. Unexpected at this price point.
13. They gave two bottles of drinking water, and there was also a kettle.
14. The 2 towels given were very low quality and rough. That was a surprise.
15. In my deluxe double room, the power socket was not near the bed. And so I could not charge my phone and just fall asleep.
16. Location is great. It’s about four minutes Walk to German beach. It’s also next to Lipo mall. There are all sorts of shops around the hotel. You can also walk to discovery mall. This morning, I strolled along the beach to Beachwalk mall at KUTA; took me under 40 minutes.
17. The main gripe I have, is that if I stop using the Internet for about two minutes, and reuse, I have to login again. But, this is a small price to pay.

Now, let’s review the Tusita Breakfast buffet. Since there are relatively few reviews on this. 20/5/2024.

If it is not included in your room booking, the cost is 75,000 IDR net. This is what I remember:

1. White rice.
2. Nasi goreng
3. Fried instant noodles
4. Chicken in soya sauce
5. Braised vegetables
6. Prawn crackers. Keropok
7. Chicken soup
8. Rice porridge and condiments
9. White bread that you can toast
10. Some jam and margarine/butter
11. Watermelon
12. Honeydew
13. Basic salad ingredients
14. Very sweet, orange syrup drink
15. Sweetened Bali coffee
16. Black tea
17. Basic cake
18. Jelly/pudding
19. Indonesian Tahu salad
20. Indonesian chicken salad
21. Cornflakes with milk.
22. You can also ask for ONE egg per person, poached, fried,  etc. I only found out at the end of my meal when I asked the waitress.

Overall it was ok. Nothing great. But most of what I tried was decent. I really liked the braised veggies. Very tasty. Not worth the 75k. But good to include in your room booking if the extra cost is not much.","- btw, my reviewed is based on my honest experience -

This is one of the comfy hotel that i've ever came in Bali, because :

1. This hotel has strategic location and very close to I Gusti Ngurah Rai Airport and also from Jerman beach.
2. There are lots of minimarkets near the hotel, you can even find them by just crossing the road in front of the hotel 😂👌🏻
3. The service is really good, the housekeeper are friendly with smiles ❤️
4. The price for staying per night is cheap. For around 250 rupiahs you can stay here with decent facilities.

Unfortunately, when I was there the swimming pool is still in the process of being repaired, hopefully it will be finished soon so that other visitors can enjoy the complete facilities. 🫶🏻

Hopefully this review helps visitors make their choice to stay here🙌🏻","Located in kartika plz area..we take a big bus going here and they have a parking lot for big bus nearby..we are surprise that:
1. a lot of mosquitos in our room,during our stay we kill maybe about 25 mosquitos in 3 days
2. bathroom floor feels slippery maybe because they never clean it
3. we must ask for a laundry bag and pairs of sandals because it can't be found in our room
4. breakfast menu is almost the same everyday,i wish they can be more creative choosing the menu so that the guest wouldn't get bored

The bed is comfy and the service is good and responsive..i think my room need some renovation because my shower is not really work properly and starting to rust,my bed table and wall decoration has a few scraches and breaks..location is great thou","Im stayed for 4days 3 night in Tusita Hotel.

7. Rock bottom service overall

Only positive is that it has plenty of shops nearby. NOT RECOMMENDED. Please DONT CHOOSE THIS HOTEL AT ANY COST","Not the best hotel in the area, yet value for money especially if you made booking online. The room is nice, but will not meet hygiene standards. Breakfast options are very limited. Nice to stay one or two nights.","A male member of staff walked into my room at night without knocking or giving any notice. Being a lone female this terrified me. Not only did this terrify me, somehow the same male staff member somehow took my private details and started messaging me on WhatsApp, phoning me and continuously messaging me. Client details should be locked and not passed onto members of staff in any circumstances let alone this. Also the aircon was leaking on the bed","I had a bit of an inconvenience during my check out : the front desk forgot to return my ID card during check in, and when I asked for it during check out, the front desk (different staff) said that no ID card was left and was quite adamant about it. Since I was in a rush to catch an early flight, I asked the staff to check with the previous front desk if by any chance someone kept my ID card and to contact me later.
As it turned out, the staff that helped me check in kept my ID card and forgot to tell the next shift.

I appreciate the honesty and the help of the staff but this wouldn't have happened if the  hotel had a proper SOP.

The hotel is strategically located between the airport and Kuta area. The price was reasonable. It's a good choice for transit. It's quite clean too.","The rooms are big and cozy for a 3-star hotel, the amenities are perfect and top qualities, the parking is fine, the staffs and services are nice, it has a big and clean pool and the location is really close to the airport,

but the only exception is the food, this is the first time I have (suspectedly) instant noodles as part of the buffet (without any add-onns, just plain fried noodles with three kind of flavors).

Besides of that, I had a great experience staying for 3d & 2n in Solaris, and I would gladly recommend it to my friends and families."
