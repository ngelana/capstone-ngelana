The blackish color on chicken may not look appetizing but don't let it deceive you, they're quite good. Overall it's recommended to try","We LOVE this place‚Ä¶ the foods taste great we tried ikan bakar, ayam kecap ( must try ) , plecing cumi, and kwitau, the price is very reasonable ( more on the cheaper side in my opinion ) for the quality and quantity foods they serve.
We went the first and the second time couple of days later only to order the same dishes again because we liked it so much! üòã. I hope this place will keep the same consistency foods all the time because we will be supporting them‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs definitely one of the best, clean, good ambience and good Vibe restaurant we‚Äôve ever been in Bali and we‚Äôll keep coming back.","Found this place in google. At first kinda hesitate with the map cause it guide us to an alley that lead to a house at the very end of the alley. The house it's actually typical Balinese house with an opening area in the middle and divided into several plot of areas. Menu offers quite a lot of variety. We order the smoked chicken cause it was recommended by the   host. We came during lunch hours, and there we some people were dinning as well. It was not long for the order to came out and the chicken was amazing, the chicken was so tender and it was full of flavors sweet and smokey flavor. All the side dish was also nice. It was amazing, I think if they are open in Denpasar areas it will be a favorite. Thinking to come back but it so far from the place that I stay, but they're available at gojek. Thank u for having us.","Good taste of food, but the road to reach this place quite challenging ..","We used to order here at least every week, sometimes even twice a week. Unfortunately sometime ago the taste has changed and the consistency of the dishes hasn't been the same. So we rarely order here anymore, we miss the old flavor."
